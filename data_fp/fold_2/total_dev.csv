0,1343,D250DB9080E0,"I agree with this prompt about the first impression, based on my own experience and for what Ive seen in myself is related or better said similar on my every day life, and what I really mean by that is: First impression that we show it wont change that easy as many people expect to change between one month to a year, not because we couldnt change it but because this is who we are, also because this is how we act and it wont change because is part of ourselves. In addition to this prompt i think it might be impossible to change our first impression not because we cant change it, but itll be because is part of our personalities, in my case should I say is part of how I really am, how my culture distinguish me, thats what makes me unic and by trying to change a part of me it would make me feel empty, because first impression means a lot to me and is all thanks to my past experiences that Ive been through. In conclusion to this paragraph i think that first impression is important, it helps you to understand how a person is, also it helps you to analyze that one person, and most of all i think it helps a lot when youre patient when trying to understand others at the first time, sometimes or most of the time people would judge others by their first impression without seeing whats really their intention, this is what I think about it, we shouldnt judge just by the first time you meet someone even if you think that person is an stranger, just give them a change to prove youre wrong with their actions and their way to treat people, thank you.",7,7,7,6,7,6,2915,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
1,3753,F2CB99D1FE9F,"Dear Generic_Name, in our school is common to see many students working in groups. I would like to tell you that by working in group I can get a lot of benefits. For example, getting a good grade, having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone. I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but thats one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples stories about their life and childhood. I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didnt try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it. Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade. When I work in group theres a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups. Sincerely: Generic_Name ",7,7,6,7,7,8,3600,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
2,3315,10AC7944DC4A,"Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" this means that if people fail they should get back up and try again and if they fail once more to never give up. Some people think that if you fail you should just give up right then and there. some people say that if they give up when they fail they should get up and try again and never loss hope, to determined, and to dedicate on what they are trying to achieve. Everyone person fails in some point of their lives its part of life to fail no one is perfect. people should never loss hope if they fail they should be determined to make it through and be successful. Hope is so important in peoples lives because lets say if someone loses they child and if that person losses hope they would stop looking for their child and if they stop looking for their child they will never find him or her. Failure is important in peoples lives because it make people to not lose hope but also it makes them to dedicate on what they are trying to succeed. People should dedicate on what they are trying to achieve or on what they want to succeed. dedication is very important in everyone lives. Cristiano Ronaldo is so dedicated to soccer that is why he is so successful he was playing in the best league in Spain now he is paying in the best league in Italy. many people admire Cristiano Ronaldo because started from the bottom and now he is one on the best player and is one the player that gets payed the most. in conclusion, people should never loss home and they should be dedicated to be successful. Having hope is very important to succeed, also to succeed people need to be dedicated and determined. In other words, to succeed people need to fail and get back up again and again.

3,223,CA7EF1C7C3FE,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college. Some students want to graduate early than other students. There are some reassons that students have to graduate early. Some of the reassons are: they want to finish high school to earn money to go to college, to take some vacations to pass time with family, also if you are a Hispanic person, youre older, and you have resposabilities, you want to get a good job with a high school diploma, if you just want to gradute early, and if you are a great student with all that you need, you can graduate early. The studentss graduation is basic in what they need and want. Some students do hard work one year early to graduate from high school. For example, if a student is 16 years old, and the student is in eleven grade, the student do not have enough credits, or dont have what the student need to graduate, the student is not going to graduate from high school. But also there are students that they have all what they need to gradute and they can graduate early. A low percetage of students have a jod, resposabilities after school, or activities to do. Schools offer many activities that students can do after school, also students stay after school to retake quiz or get help from a teacher. If a student need to graduate early for any reasson, the student need to work hard, and get all what the student need to gradute. Also the student have to do extra work. For example, if the student dont understand any subject, the student have to stay after school, and get help from a teacher to pass the subject and get the credits. One disadvantage that the student can have is that if the students have a job after school, the student can get tired from high school and his/her job. And the student can stop to do what the student need to gradute. The student have to make an effort to graduate early. Some school offer programs that allow high school students to gradute in three years. Some of the programs are in summer, in the evening. Those programs help students to finish high school, its a easy way to get credits in a short period time. The minimum of students are not able to be into theze type of programs. One of the reasson can be that the student work in summer. If the students are not able to be in the programs, they have another opportunity, they can take courses online. In conclusion it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college, but have advantage and disadvantages. One advantage are that some school offers programs or students can take courses online, that can help students to graduate. One disadvantage is that, students can get tired, they to do hard work, if they want to gradute early. Students that want to graduate in three years and enter college, some students have a job after school to earn money to college. All depends in the student, if the student do all the work, the student is going to graduate but, if the student dont do the work, the student is not goin to graduate.",7,7,6,7,6,7,2761,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people. First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. Theres some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, its a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, im fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i cant learn from the book. Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and theres blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" Im so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know im the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save peoples life. What a mighty job it is!

5,562,AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you wont have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls arent great because most people arent paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you wont meet any people and you wont learn how to socialize at the end you wont learn how speak to people. The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school. To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you arent at a on campus school,Youre grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you dont go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. Its not fun staying home With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day its still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they arent doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education thats not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they arent using there whole brain to do theyre work. One of the major reason why online classes arent good because you can just google the answers thats just cheating you arent learning its cheating. Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students dont listen or even look at the screen to the call. Its just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you wont have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldnt need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education. The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they wont be able to anything for the future for there education because they didnt pay attention or learn it well plus they wont have any friends to know them. In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.

7,275,E853D5DD528D,"People should be guidance by experts and authorities because in that way we can have less people killing each other; however, their are people that dont like to share their situation and there is where the suicide came from. Although some say that people shouldnt to be guide by experts because they dont like to people tell them what to do, actually people should be guide by experts because they can show people to love each other and make a better world with no violence. Their are people that dont like to be guide by others but they have a knowing in their life in what is good and bad by their experiences. For example my gram pa, he doesnt like to be guide by others but he said that he has an understanding in what is good and bad. He also told me that some people try to guide you for the bad way, by showing you how to drink beers or smoke cigarettes and you have to be ready to say not to those type of drugs but, I believe that we need to have experts and authorities to guide us about lifes important. Actually, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some experiences have better knowing then other ones and learn how to love each other. I would like to be guide by experts and learn about their experiences. That could be awesome.

Violence can be make by a bad understanding. Thats why people should seek guidance from experts and learn how to talk to each other.

However I encourage to al young people you seek guidance from experts until they have a better knowing in their decisions. We as humans always make mistakes and we learn through them, but we need help from each other.

9,2838,BFB07811C92D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people think that they can control there first impressions at any time that they wanted to, but thats is not right, first impressions are so fast that it does not let you think, or express in a different way they are faster them a second, there are impressions that can be change, but it depends in the situation that you are in, and other can not be change no matter what you do. I agree with this statement, because impressions are an affect, feeling or image retained after an experience. Some impressions had a really bat affect in our lives, less say there was a time were maybe the only impression that some had was really not the one he wanted, but was the only one he could do, for example let say that there is a student in a classroom, maybe he is not feeling good, and he fart that it makes a realy loud some, and that everyone in the class hear it, his first impression will be to act normal but he could not act normal, because he knows that it was so loud that everyone heard him, so his going to feel shame of him self, his face is going to get red, and his hears and but thats something you can not control. The feeling that some get at the firs impression is almost like something you dont have every day, well if you have embarrassing moment every time them you may get the wired feeling every day. Went you get the firs impression and is not every day situation is almost all time shame, confusion, uncomfortable, some times pain. But when is a every day thing, them is almost all the time happynes, like the feeling I get went my family ask me embarrassing questions or we have embarrassing moments. Is almos all the time happiness. Because it is a very day thing that they ask me things that it makes me uncomfortable. The experiences that people get went they have a lot of firs impressions, are so impressive that they can act normal in a lot of situation, for example went they were use to act embarrass or shame now they are capable to act normal, because of the experience that they had. Like I personable had a lot of experience that now insted of feel shame or embarrass I only get happiness. like went my mom ask me if i had a girlfriend I only smile or answer her that i do not and it is all normal, or at school went my friends ask me if Im dating the girl I like, the answer I give them is yes or not, like a normal student, I dont get shame or anything. Because I had some experience during my life that it make me feel normal now. I hope that in the future one day, when someone ask me something embarrass, and make me get a moment when my first impression is shame, or embarrass my feeling dont show up, and my experiences take place, for it not to have more affect in the moment, and make it more embarrassing than what it is already, because I dont want it to make me lost my mine, and make the moment the worst one in my life.

As a kid everyone has always imagined of them being like or better then someone. These are my reasons of why I agree with the famous Albert Einstein. First of all, without an imagination you wouldnt have dreams to succeed. Myself for example Ive always wanted to be a professional soccer player. But than I realized that soccer isnt very popular in America. So than i started playing football and I enjoy playing that sport very much. Since than Ive always imagine of being a professional football player. Secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it everyday in many ways. Imagination is like an opinion,no one can take that from you. It can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them. As one can see,me as a football player. I use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Because I am very competitive when it comes to sports, I always want to be better than the old me. I always want to be one step ahead from everyone. For that reason I think I use my imagination a lot. Like if I ever lose at something I would think about it and say ""imagine if I won"".

11,927,71B72E8890F1,"Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax. Also when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years. We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments.

The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class.

13,113,DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. Theres other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study others failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isnt wrong, theres still other success with out failure. First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you cant success to be the best soccer player if you dont practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, youll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure. Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, theres some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it. Another way people can success, is by watching others failure and success. When you watch others failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldnt have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You dont just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure. So Winston isnt wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making youll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time. So I dont agree with Churchills statement, because their is more then just failure to success. Theres so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study others failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i dont agree with Winston Churchill.",7,7,6,6,7,6,3183,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
14,1037,EC2758A5B74E,"Dear School board, Why does a students education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. Whats also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. Thats why I agree with the school boards plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldnt feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter. To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldnt feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isnt a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isnt necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the students work at our school without rushing them. Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldnt have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, weve never been able to finish, not because it wasnt possible to, but because there simply wasnt enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but its also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher. Lastly, the school boards plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students arent at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which lets them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run. In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldnt feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community.

15,2926,ACA1A45EE438,"I strongly disagree with extending the school days. Longer school days can have a great impact on students. It also makes class hours long. Most students likes to have short classes. Longer school days can make students, exhausted, have less free time, and hate school. Longer school days will not make students happy. Longer school days can make students exhausted. Longer school day causes the classes to be longer. Which most students get tired of being in the same class for a long time. Students get tired of doing a lot of work in class which make them want to do less work. Students will be exhausted which will make them not go outside. By extending school days students will not have free time. Most students like to spend time with their family and friends. However, longer school days can take that privilege away. Longer school days can take away students free time. Most of the year it can get dark outside early, and students wont be able to go outside after they come from school. Since students wont have enough free time to go outside they will hate going to school. Students will hate going to school when there is longer school days. Because students like to have less class time. Also students would want to do less work. Students wouldnt want to be in their least favorite class for a long time. If the school hours get longer students would not want to come to school. Also some students would skip the classes they didnt like. By adding hours to the school days students will be, tired, they wont be able to have free time, and they will not want to be at school. Students will hate school if the hours get longer. Students will not enjoy school. Also classes would have a lot of work in one day which would make them not want to come to school.

In other way, been with a good attitude can help us improve in life that helps us to learn, to concentrate and, to be a good thinking of someone else. Also, something kind of the same happened to me some time ago when my father was teaching me how to drive, and every time I did something wrong he yelled at me and one day I was with a really bad attitude because of that and than I realized that been mad was not going to help me so i changed my attitude and i learn to drive really fast. Been mad only makes us worst at doing that because we are not thinking about the positive thinks of that activity just at the negative thinks and thats what makes everything worst.

17,3740,25597135F582,"Students that dont want to be in high school for four years, plan on finishing earlier than others. These students have already gotten their credits and just need a few more to finish. Students want to get a early head start than their other classmates, they have enough credits to finish their junior and senior year in one go. Its a great idea for students to get a head start on college and the workforce one year early. Students that get an earlier head start plan on starting their careers while in college. The jump from high school to college is way different but its a better step for students. A friend of mine had finished high school earlier and got to start college earlier and now their life is going to start because they went on the right path to start their career. Colleges offer programs to students to help them get their degree like Masters or Bachelors degree faster so they can achieve the career they were trying to achieve. Many colleges offer this program as one of my family members is going for their Masters and they are going to get it a year earlier than majority of their classmates. Some students have already been into the workforce already and now they would like to finish high school and become a full time employee instead of a part time employee. Students that are still in school that already work cannot make more than 40 hours due to the fact that they are still under the age of 18. Full time employees make more than 40 hours but some of those employees still go to school due to the fact that they are balancing school and their work life. Studentss that are in school are either a full time student and part time employee or a full time student and full time employee. Some students in school majority of the time they work put their schedule as everyday at a certain time or they work weekends. Students finishing high school early is benefit for the students that would like to finish early because they want that head start in life. They want to start college so they can get started on their future career and get that dream job. Students want to become a full time employee instead of a part time employee so they have more hours and get better pay to go to college to be a full time student and full time employee. For these reason I agree with this statement that its a good idea to finish high school early to get into college earlier or into the workforce.

22,2473,6C6B01577E01,"Yes i agree with Churchills statement about the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because we need to learn to not lose hope in what we want for success and our future. Imagine you keep on failing and failing but knowing your going to be successful in life? Imagine not losing fate or enthusiam to pursuit for success? That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam."" How would you know your going to fail to pursuit for success? What is success? Success is to achieve goals you been wanting to accomplished. Everyone wants to accomplished something or anything. It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success. Its understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right. No one is perfect,its understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it. Everyone wants to be successful in life or in anything. For an example when you apply for a job you to apply first, then wait for a response for the interview,After when the interview is done you have to wait a couple days or two until they call you to notify you if you have gotten the position or not. Well thats how we feel when were trying pursuit for success hoping that we can do this and having fate to not give up. When you know your failing to pursuit for success is when you keep making mistakes but you keep going until you get it right. No matter how many times you keep making mistakes it wont stop you from what you are doing or trying to get. You can be still successful no matter how much you fail because it will make you smater for success. Success is something that many have achieved or have not but at the end of the day were resposiable for any mistakes,actions and verbal language that we have used,It could affected anyone or anywhere.

This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all. For example, I know a lot of people that that do classes in the morning and at night time to catch all the work for the classes they hard.

24,3625,5D4D6519DF94,"Haile G/Selasie, one of the most famous long distance runners of all time, did not pave his way to success because he was born with it. He came from a poor family, and walked a long distance to his school everyday. When he started running, he was not good at all. He worked day and night to get to where he is. And when he speaks about his past, he tells the story of how he failed again and again a lot of times but he never lost his passion for his dream. And now he is one of the richest people in Ethiopia and one of the best record holders of Marathon. Success is a dream for most and a reality for only a few. When it comes to how success is achieved, it creates a great question in all our minds and that is,""How can I be successful?"". Some say that success is achieved by going through failures without giving up or without losing hope. That is a truly arguable idea and some might think different. But I fully agree with that idea. The fact that almost all of the masterminds that are known for their creations of the bulb, physics theories, telephone and many more of the things we take for granted at the moment told the story of how they tried and failed many times than they count. And that is one proof of the point that success doesnt come without failure. There might be some people that argue this point by pointing out that many people have tried and failed and tried again but it didnt help them achieve their dreams. That is a good point but the fact is that failing is not the only thing that determines your success, but failing and not being discouraged is what really counts. If we plan to achieve a goal, we shouldnt lose our excitement for that specific thing were doing, we should rather be more encouraged to try harder and to find another way to make it work. For example, when we first built a rocket,it wasnt done in a day or in the first try. Engineers tried to fix the problem in the mechanical part. Scientists tried to see if their calculations was wrong or if the combination of the chemicals didnt work and many others tried to fix it but they failed more than a couple of times. By not giving up though, it was a success at last. It might not always seem like it but failure leads to success. The main point is not giving up and not losing our enthusiasm. As the saying goes, ""If you fail once, try and try harder"". Never give up on your dreams and dont be discouraged by failure.

25,2538,076262AA0CD5,"The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble Once, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night. Some people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews arent carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure. The curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous. The curfews is brought out to protect all teenagerss future from being damaged by any of their wrongful commitment. The curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because most of them would not want to be kidnapped or murdered while walking on the street at night. To prevent any harmful cause that can happen to young people, the U.S. government should set up curfews for teenagers. In fact, there are many unfortunate cases of missing teenagers in America. This fact proves that numerous teenagers had been kidnapped while they wander around empty public places at night. In this case, the U.S. government should adopt curfews law because it can decrease the act of kidnapping teenagers. However, some teenagers are killed while they are going out at night because there are a lot of robbers appear during this time. To solve this problem, the U.S government should let the city council bring out the curfews law, which can restricts all teenagers from going out at night and protect them from being murdered. In conclusion, curfews law is significant because it can reduce the criminal acts within a society. It shapes the society to be more organized and less dangerous to the citizens. The curfews can keep teenagers out of trouble because it restricts teenagers from committing any unfortunate crime. It helps teenagers to become better individuals in society who treat others in a correct way. Specially, teenagers can avoid death and being kidnapped when they obey to the curfews and stay home at night. Lastly, we should set up curfews and believe that it can protect all teenagers from getting trouble because they are going to be the one who runs the planet one day.",8,9,9,9,9,9,99,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

Curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it keeps most of the teenagers by not sneaking out of their houses, and not getting into bad habits. The curfew would keep teenagers safe by the increase of robberies. The curfew would save teenagers out of trouble by not letting teenagers go outside by them selves. The curfew helps teenagers feel safe that they would be no one in the streets. When teenagers are left home alone, they get scared because they are by themselves and they are afraid that someone would break into their house. Most house robberies occur at night and it makes teenagers worry that robberies can take place anywhere. Teenagers regret going anywhere at night because of the curfew and robbers. Some teenagers does not like going outside at night when there is a curfew because they dont want to break the law, and they dont want to get kidnapped. Some teenagers wont go outside either because they are scared of dark, and that kidnappers with catch them, because robbers and kidnappers are often out in midnight. Teenagers, that know why the curfew is on, they will obey the law and not break the law. Teenagers often walk to stores at night to grab snacks, or drinks, the curfew will help them not go to stores at midnight.",7,7,6,6,7,7,1148,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I can not say this is a wrong opinion, but I have a different opinion with Thomas Jefferson. While other people might think that if you keep working hard, and there will be one day that you can get successful. Because you did not give up for this things, however this is a wrong way to thinking, the reason behind this is yes it is ture that if you are keep working and do not give up then you might be become a successful person but Its still depend on what kind of ways are you choice to go. if you choice a wrong way to go then you get a big mistake, you have to start all over again, thats wasting time. Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try. So my suggest is people should be thinking before they want working hard, to make a plan or talk to someone and konw what they think. Then you cna get more easily to successful.",6,5,6,5,4,6,2468,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

33,1212,1F28812EE23D,"This assay is going to be about a thing that some businesses are doing which is to make a four day work week adding two hours to the regular work days. This essay will have my opinion if we should implement this idea in my school or not. I will talk about some advantages and disadvantages about the implement of this idea to my school. I will suggest some action that a shool should take before the implementing of this idea of this idea. Imagine that you recieve a letter from your school saying that they are planning implement and idea which is to make students come to school four days instead of five adding two hours to the normal day of school. I disagree with this idea because it will affect my school which is a high school, instead of helping it. The first thing that will be affected will be the after school program and activities. If my school add two hours to our schedule each day will consist in ten hours, so students will be more tired and less student will be interest in involving in after school programs so the school might cancel them. I would said that it will affect a high school especially because there are a lot of juniors and siniors that work after school and it can cause to most of them to quit their jobs. Implementing this idea to our school have some advantages and disadvantages as well. One advantage of adding two hours to our schedule are that we will have more time to do our work in school because classes should be longer. Another advantage is that this idea help to conserve energy and resources of the school. A disadvantage is that after school programs might be closed because not so many people will be interested in that. The other disadvantage is that some students might have to change their jobs hour which is not easy and some of them would have to opt for quiting their jobs. Before adding this idea to my school or any school they should ake some actions before. First the school staff should make a meeting to discuss the idea. Then they should make another meeting but this time including the parents of the students. In which they explain to them in what the idea consist. Next they should send a letter home in which the idea is well explained but this time parents have to sign the letter and say wether they agree to the implement of the idea or desagree. Finally after doing all this now the school can decide wether the idea is being implemented or no. In conclusion I disagree with implementing this idea to my school because it will affect the school instead of helping it. I would say that this idea have a lot of desadvantages too. For example the school might cancel after school activities, some students might lose their jobs, and we will get home more tired. I think that the schedule thath my school have right now is just great because students play sports, participate in after school programs, and some others can work too. I think that my school should not implement this idea because we are fine with the schedule that we have and adding two hours will just affect us instead of being beneficial.

Because of praising students in a long times, it migt be would make them image anything that they want to do is all for others praise to them. Also, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. The praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. First of all, praising students in a long times, it might be would make them think of anything that they want to do is all for others praise to them. Because students can easily get distracted by praising from others, they could not be focus to be themselves when theres too much praises for them. Students need to remember that people may give praise to bring them up and surely can bring them down anytime. So, students do not need to listen to anybodys praise or anything that is unreal. Otherwise,a better way is students should be believing in themselves that they can do well on anything hard works. Secondly, the achivement of students are only come when they can be self confident to face any hard works. Students should learn how to handle any hard works when they go out to the real life. They need to facing to real things, real problems and that is how they can be true self esteem. They cant be afraid or lose their spirit whenever they fail. Also, students can be achivement while they know exactly what they should do to reach their goal on the future. Student better know that people only remember to them when they become success, but if they arent no will care about them. Finally, the praise given is something that cannot be stay in one person foever, praise is to support students spirit while they become successful. Because the praise from others to them can easily forget very quickly. So students should know the goods and bads of the praise, it could bring students to more success when they know that the praise of people can helps. Students can be famous and getting praising from others anytime when they do something great or they can show people about how well their capability are. The achivement of people are not coming from anyones praise, that is about how hard they were try and what were they faced to reach their goal. Also only believing in themselves could bring them to the successful in future.

We meet new cultures by others student who are in our group. We start to learn know his culture and what they believe. We start to learn about they language and how they communicate in their language too. Also the food and the music from their country. Meet new persons from others countrys is good so that way we start to know more about the world. We learn how to communicate with others person not only our language in others to. We start to talk with new persons. We start to share things from our culture and what like to do and our free times. We start work together and getting better by communicating. Communication is important for every one. In groups we can help each other in projects or even in late work if we miss a day of class. Went there is a new person the group can help the new student with school stuff: where the next class is, where the cafeteria is, where the buses stop, etc. Also be in a group helps to perform our skills for communicate and language. Be in a group also help to make work more easy because we help each other by putting ideas together. Groups are the best way to perform language speaking. Some people might say work alone is better because is only my self no one more, but in a group is more easy way to learn with help. Know new cultures from differents parts of the world is fun.

People find that so enjoyable becasue you can get fit and have fun from playing basketball. People even play basketball just to exercise and stretch. This leads you to working out while you run across the basketball court and shoot the ball into the hoop. Finally, it can make you mentally fit because of how focused you are on basketball.

Although distance learning can effect students losing focuses in their classes, nevertheless, learning away from school can help us the students to have less stress, and giving us an opportunity to take care of our brothers and sisters and attending classes without skipping classes. Almost everyone in school is stressing about something,so attending classes online would help a lot. For example: It gives us more time to finish our work for other class and stress less, because to me having the advantage to attend online classes would help out a lot, and also i might have other classes to worry about. so having an option for us the students to attend class from home by using online or video conferencing might not sound the worst. And could help students who are suffering from anxiety and having any type of stress. By using online classes they could listen to music to clam themselves down and not having any signs of a panic attack, because in school not every class or teachers might let the students use their phone to listen to music; they might not be able to know if the student is having a panic attack, but at home if they are attending classes online and having a panic attack their parents would be there to help them clam down. Most students need to stay home in order to help with family emergence. Research has show that almost 50% of the time if the student is not at school, then they are at home helping out with their siblings at home, doing that they skipping school and losing an education, but with online classes they can do both without skipping class or missing anything in school. Because with online class the information they need would be provided to them, if they have a laptop or computer and in case they do not have any of these technology they can just go to their local Library with their siblings and do their assessments with no worries, because their siblings would find some kind of fun to do at the library. In conclusion attending classes online at home would benefit a lot for us the students because in case some thing happens at home they just go online at do their work without stress about losing points, to me personal attending classes online would be very helpful because I would have to stress a lot, can skip school and get some sleep.

After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming.

In my opinion,if we dont try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,well never grow because well never have the enough experience and a better quality of life. First,well never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience well have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesnt matter that we good.

For example,when we continue learning more and more well stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way.

You need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything so you can grow. Ill give you a example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that. You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. Its good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. Its always good to do more what you Mastered in life.

For example doing something that i might regret doing or not thinking positively before doing something also scared of not being to reach my goal in life. Second reason of why i do agree is because when you have that feeling that you feel good and confident about yourself you just know your doing great but then something inside you just wants to give up and throw everything away. Third reason i feel like if i stay int the same bubble i will never grow out of it by being scared and not having positive feelings towards me. I just think it isnt easy as it looks to loose something and seeing the you wont grow from it. Lots of people make mistakes that they regret and they wanna change that but they cant its to late but its never to late to try all over again until you grow out of that spot. people just think giving up on things you like doing is easy to forget but it s not because thats something you love doing and youve mastered doing in all your life youve kept that postive view in your mind people just give up when they realize that they cant continue thats how you will never grow by giving up its hard to when you come to a point that you commited a bad thing and you regret doing you cant take it back but life is also giving us the chance to improve and forget about everything and continue to grow bigger from that small place you feel inside you never give up on anything just continue on what you feel confident on doingand be happy.

I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts dont change. In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it. Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldnt be together. Your mind wont change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way. So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

48,1225,06FA8EF28227,"Many people in the history of the world were important because they become who they want to be, and now society try to persuade people from who they are and change to what they want, to be your self in a world that is constantly traying to make you something else is the gratest accomplishment, also you decide who you want to be I agree with this because some times parents try to change their children, also school making decision for their students, religion first point parents trying to change their children, in some cases parents try to persuade their children from what they want to do or from what they want to be on the future, if some one of their children want to play soccer and if their parents do not know everything about soccer they search anything they just say no and they make their children to try something different or if the child do not want to go the place that they are going most of the parents do not listen what their sons want or like and also sometimes parents make their children to be what they do not what to be in some cases parents tell they children that they need to play an instrument liket the guitar but maybe that child wants to play the drums. some famous people are unhappy because their parents make them to become famous but maybe that child do not want to do that. second point some times school makes decision for students too some times students do not want to take some classes and school choose for them, in some parts students do not like to wear uniforms and they make them to wear it, in case that you came from other country and you do not speak the same language you need to be able to learn because if you did not do it you are not able to be in the school and if you do not understand what are they talking about is hard but you need to be like them because you do not have people who speak the same language as you do, so you have to be part of something even if you do not like it third point religion is there to try to change your mind they are many religions in the world but all depends if you want to choose one of those religions but some times people try to make you part of that religion and some times you change completly of who you was if that work for you is perfect but if not you are going to be completly different person, you need to dress different at you usual do, and also they tell you what is wrong and what is not wrong even if you did not do anything wrong they think that and they always want you to belieb things that maybe are not true but why we need to follow that and why we need to beliebe that, so if you want to do something do that thing because you want it not because someone tells you. In my opinion I agree with what Albert Emerson wrote because to be our self in this world that is constantly traying to make us something else is the greatest accomplishment, is hard to be our selfs because people are always traying to tell us about what we are going to do because for the society what they do is good but maybe you have a different idea but most of the time you need to do what they tell you to do the best accomplishment is being ypour self and being what you want to be and if you want to do something just do it and do not listen about what other people say or what they think because people are never happy with the things that you do.

The school is really good fundamental step, to teach us what the student want to be on the future and prepare for it. For example two year ago I meet a friend on Cuba who never went to school, he always been saying I dont want my expend my time on the school, when i can work and make really good money. For this moment is really good, because he dont has bill to pay, but after that he grow up. When he has to pay his own bill, and the money is not enough.

Generic_Name try to be success on the life and help his Mon what she need doing the right thing. So he never give up and he study hard to graduated.

52,712,597D76A3BF40,"I would like to start of this topic with a important question that no human being really thinks about, ""How is technology impacting our health?"" That is one of the most important questions that we cant leave unanswered. The use of technology have rooted in our lives, from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to bed we have hundreds of interaction with various devices, software programs, and tools. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having any contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to any other person. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. While one might think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on peoples lives, others might think that the lack of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives which most people agree with. When comparing two human beings, one human being that always uses technology to do everything, shop, check out books, play games, do homework, and even talk to friends or family members, that person is most likely going to get sick, be in a lot of pain, or even feel depressed sooner then the person that prefers not to use technology at all but instead of using technology they would rather go out to the store to buy a book, go out to the store to shop new clothes, and even instead of calling on the phone to check on a family member they would rather go out and see them in real life. The reason the person that uses technology more is more likely to get sick or be in pain sooner than the other one is because not only computers and devices encourage more sedentary behavior among users but they also frequently lead to poor posture, neck stain, back issues, and hearing loss. This sort of behavior can lead to chronic pain and discomfort that is hard and not really easy to treat. Now that we have explained and understood this topic a little bit better lets go back to the question that we asked at the beginning, in case some of you guys forgot the question, the question was ""How is technology impacting our health?"" If people really took the time to think about this question that we usually always leave unanswered we would have known that technology isnt impacting our health in any positive way, technology actually makes us stressed, makes our eye vision bad, gives us back pain, hearing loss, and a lot of other negative outcomes. Another reason why people might feel depressed when they use technology a lot, is because they dont really interact with people and dont have any friends since all they do is stay at home and do everything on their device. Its scientifically proved that every human being need at least one or more friends to talk to every time they feel down and dont feel really good about something. That is the reason why most of the people that use technology a lot, sometimes feel depressed and dont really like to interact with other people around them. In conclusion , technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a negative effect on peoples life and if people dont learn how to control and manage their time and not use technology every chance they get, our next generation will be exactly the same as this one right now .The sad thing about the limitation of human contact due the use of technology is that there is no turning back at this point we are in a society where technological innovation and progression is the norm; It would take a minor miracle to reverse all this disaster. In order for all of this mess to get better, people need to start learning about how to balance their time even if theyre using technology, otherwise it is only going to get worse and many people will start feeling pain in their back, getting sick, feeling depressed due to the lack of interacting with people and due to the use of technology.

53,1240,4D816E688FBD,"This Essay Is about:To conserve energy and resources do we have to extening the school day two hours, four-day school week? My opinion about this question is that we dont need to extend the school day and go to the school four-day a week. Why? Easy, because if the students spend more time in the school everday, we just loose energy. We get tired, we are not focus in class, we forget what we learned, affect your communication with your family. We get tired even now, that we just come for seven hours. If we spend more time in the school, the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are. Getting tired students start loosing they energy and, they do not pay attention what the teacher is saying. Sometimes I feel like I cant anymore my body and my mind need to take a rest. Your mind start loosing power when you get tired. Get tired and do not have a good rest is not healthy. we are not focus in class. When you start the day after a good rest, your mind start the day fresh. If your mind is fresh, you get better focus and powerful mind to think about what you are doing. During the day after few hours, you start getting tired and, loosing focus about what you are doing. If we spent more time in class, we gonna get bored and we can start talking with the neighbor, distract the others students and interrupt the class. After the school time students are gonna be so tired (body and mind) that they will want to arrive at home take a rest, leaving the homeworks without do it. We forget what we learned. It is so simple forget what we learned during the day, specially if we are going fast and talk about different topics. If we extend the school day, we most see different topics and we will going fast,forgeting about the last topic. This happend because we lose focus,when we are thinking in the differents process and topics. When your mind is process one information (lets say ""Math"") and, you do not even practice for a while, you just get it and, the teacher pass to the next unit (beacuse the period is longer cause the extending school day), you most will forget what you learned last unit. Affect your communication with your family. how extending the school day, affect your communication with your family? Well, lets say the most of the time you are in the school, some parents work during the day. But in the afternoon when the kid arrive at home parents spend time with them. If extending the school day, by the afternoon the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are and, they just will want to take a rest the rest of the afternoon. You have three days of weekend to do what ever you want and, have a conversation with your family? of course you have an extraday now, but remenber thats just for students your parents still working one more day. The weekend the students can use it for homeworks that mean you do not have much time to have a conversation or pass time with your falimily. My conclution is: If you gonna get tired, do not gonna be focus in class or you will forget what we learned, it is not a good idea to extend the school day, because at the end do not bring anyhelp for students. And can be worth for some of them. Take a good rest, be focus in class and keep what you learned, those are the students beneficts. The extratime I spent on my homeworks at home plus the school day, it is enough to learnd and be focus on study and get a fresh mind.",7,6,6,6,4,7,1010,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Also some parents like to ask their children what he or she want to be in the future for example: doctor, teacher, dentist, police or engineer. At school teachers tell students to do a draw about what they are dreaming to be in their future and every students at young age are have in mind what they will be in the future. It is a good idea fo students to commit to career at young age. Students need time to prepare for they career in way to succeed in what they want to be in their future. For example, all career take time to learn about each subjec and students might dont have enough credits to past some classes and they have to take the class again. In addition some students wants to be doctors and the career for doctors take a long time and a lot of money that they need to have in way to be get that career.

56,2783,079FDB42E429,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or dont like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school. Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home.

58,1084,F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldnt attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home. Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think its much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment. One reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because its difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didnt pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. Its undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade. Another reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasnt like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didnt see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he wont come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I cant say if its a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasnt like to talk. In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldnt attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life.

59,91,E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal. Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isnt strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isnt strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isnt strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone. Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here. Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person. While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that dont really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people dont find examples of influential that arent interesting or appealing to them at all because its doesnt suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasnt really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasnt influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really cant influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something.

63,1468,037C88B5B111,"Most of the schools in around the world that cut off hours in school, and they get a good results. Some people say that is the good idea, but some people think that a bad idea depend on their opinion. If they extending the school day two hours, to a four- day school a week, they will give students get more chances to focus what they like, time to explore and spend more time for family. Some of the countries try to improve it and they received a lot of good responds from students and parents recently. New things always have a difference opinion, and so many people could not adapt it, but one day it will bring a revolution to education. The first thing brought the benefit for this idea is students can able to focus what they like. In the real world, Students have so much things to do. They have to start school at 7am to 2pm, it takes a long period of day and they could not practice what they like. If they can get less hours a day in school so they could practice sports, music,sciences instead of math and English. There must have some students interesting at classes in school and they enjoy it, but they are still force to take classes that they do not like, its not their advantages. Some students would quit school because they could not find out themselves in there, and it will costs a lot of problems into the future especially effects to the next generation. That why schools should give students more hour to get what they like to do. The problem related to previous the first thing is time for family. Still, students spent all day long in school, and some of them want to do their favorite things after school, then they accidentally forget spend time with their family. Family is the root behind success of student, but when they get home, they have to do their homework at midnight. So many tradition families that have a rule that student have to follow then they do not have time to do their homework. Some of students have a jobs after school to get more benefits, scholarships, to prepare their life in college. Some students just want to support their family and do not have time to think about school. they have to bring their homework everywhere they go. If schools follow a four-day school week, it would be better to students and their family; they can get more time to hangout; they do not need worry about school or test tomorrow. Students can enjoy their time with family. The important thing that can not miss is time to explore. A fish can not claim like a monkey, some people good at math, some at music or art and we can not take a person good at math to do music. That is exactly going on in school life; students can not find out what they truly want to do; they do not have creative. If school follow a four-day school week, students can receive more extra times to explore the world and life. They could discover nature that teachers can help them, reality could help students get more experiences and discover themselves what they good at. Europe countries like Holland and Ireland had tried this and they got the highest education in the world. In Europe, they do not have homework, students go to school four or five days a week but less hours. that is good thing that every schools in the world should follow. Eventually, schools and teachers just want do the best for young generation, and they want to make a better life. Sometimes, they should flexible time and give students a chance to focus what they like, family and to explore a life. Students still able to finish their work, only 24 hours a day is not enough for them to complete everything. School, themselves and family, that is a lot of things to do in a day. Life is hard, do not make it harder, that is a good quote to say. Schools should give students more time.

64,696,FE459F8CF4CE,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", this phrase said by the American jazz legend Duke Ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and I agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you dont know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation. Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again. Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem. In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.",6,4,8,6,6,6,3863,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
65,490,DA5CA667B729,"My dad once said"" that one day Ill save a life just by calling 911"". The reason he said that is that the technology today is better than the one he grew up with. Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency. It helps people communicate with people around the world. For example my Uncle cant leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does he cant return to the states. So the technology now allows him to Skype or Facetime his mom when he wants. In fact 70% of the people around the world can communicate. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button. People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. The cops came in like 3 minutes. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life. Technology does have a positive effect on people. It can help people talk to people all over the world. People can also call 911 for emergency. Other people believe that technology is the root of evil, however technology helps everybody no matter what.

67,585,C49F716838E7,"Should students attend to year-round schools? Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students. In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job. For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school. It was not easy being their because me and my brothers did not know much Spanish but know is are first language. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year. After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. It was so much better being in a normal school because I had more time in school vacation as a student, also had a summer job, and more time for me and family. Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do. In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together. But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life. In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons.

For example a good behavior star at home because your parents have the responsibility to educate. Also some people said the students are very bad for other students, like they are bad influence . My second, reason would be the your own problems can affect, your career.

78,3372,822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do. One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then youre never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot. Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but youre in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isnt going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because youre doing something for your own good. Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say im tired then youre never going to do anything, youre just giving up on yourself. For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things youll end up liking it. If youre an active person youll accomplish way more than expected because youre going to be moving around and getting out youre comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because youre talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because youre going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more. I strongly do believe that if youre doing something that you put your mind to, then youre always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say youre going to do something youll never do it because youre just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.

79,246,FF6224AC70C6,"A city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers,10 P.M on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. There are conflicting opinions over this topic. According to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. In my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families. Curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. As they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. For young people sleep time should be 7-8 hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. Young people are more energetic if they sleep well. Staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. Unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. As you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. A lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. Also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. To protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. As when me myself could not sleep well,I am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. This alot of times effects my grades. Also when I stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,I am not focused and asleep. This adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. Staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young peoples health. Along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. It is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. Not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. Unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. Not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. If teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. Whenever I eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. I have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if he sits down,a lot of people teases him for his fatty body and also he cannot even walk fast because he gets tired fast. So to stay away from these bad comments and unfit body teens should eat healthy food and home made food. Apart from food and sleep curfew for teenagers make them stay home with their families. This makes them to interact with their families instead of going out with friends. Most of times generation gap is being shown in between families that is just because of less attraction in between people in the families. Having dinner together at night makes you discuss various aspects going on around us. Like when our family get together we talk about of new things we tried,just as me and my sister made new friends as we shifted here this year. Also we talk about how to be aware from diseases going on in recent days. We also discuss about problem we are suffering from. This makes us share our happiness and problems we are going through in our life and also we are able to intract wih the family members. There are various more ideas that shows that this adoption takes teens lives towards positive aspects. Proper sleep,healthy food and interaction with their families can be obtained if this curfews are adopted. To make future generation healthy and concentrated about development and growth of our country these laws are need to be applied. If teens will be healthy they will come up as fresh and present minded citizens towards the country. If they will sleep well,they will work hard to make their dreams come true. Also if they will interact with their families they will make each and every one satisfied in world. Teens should take this in a positive way instead of taking it as a restriction on their freedom. This is not a reastriction but a key to live healthy,fresh and active way of life. Give teens life by restricting their habits instead of giving them dealth with improper lifestyle.",7,7,7,7,5,7,3891,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasnt the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. Ive lost a lot of people ive cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away. Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go.

84,2556,82F9FDBD6F98,"My argument about the 10pm curfew for teenagers statement; is they should have a curfew for teenagers because it can get them out of trouble, and make it home safe and they can get rest for school. Example of staying out of trouble is you can get mistaken at night; and get hurt just by not going home at the right time. Another example a teenager can be at there friends house and if they leave late or outside with there friend, anybody can be outside and would want to hurt them or there friend because its dark out, but if you have the 10 pm curfew you can leave without worrying about being in trouble. also can have a guardian to pick you up when its late so this scenario would not happen. Another reason is to get some good rest for school and have lots of energy. If you do not have enough sleep, but can have the 10 pm curfew to help you to get some rest and will also help you concentrate in school. An example for this is a teenager could be outside and they do not have a curfew so the teenager comes home late. And does not get good sleep or no sleep and goes to school tired and cant concentrate. A good counter claim for both is you can just stay home and dont have worry about a curfew or going home really late. because if you are scared to go home late or cant get some rest just stay home. You will be more safe home with a guardian or sibling then outside in the dark and not knowing who is outside. And parents should just be more protective so they dont end up going home late. And they can stay home and sleep earlier and get lots of rest for school. with both arguments i think the best for teenager is that they should have a curfew just for safety reasons. And no parents should be worried or scared for there kids being outside late because there city council do not have a curfew. And another reason is they can get good sleep for teenagers is very helpful for them so they can have a lot of energy and concentrate in class better and get good grades.",5,6,6,6,6,7,1730,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them. Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they dont have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home. Online classes or videos conferencing not catchs the students attention like a teacher makes it. For example, if you are taking online classes from home and you are at the midpart of one the lesson but you get hungry then, you left the lesson to get eat. After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school?

91,174,CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new. One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didnt know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasnt that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends. Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldnt play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesnt take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasnt a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldnt be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didnt know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. Im in middle school and I couldnt get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.

92,2420,57B782277D2F,"Think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone and what do you feel is more beneficial? I think that working with a group is more beneficial because you can get things done quicker, share creative ideas, and it shows teamwork. It also saves up time when working in a group and when having deadlines. First, working with a group gets things done quicker and you dont have to worry about much things when working with a group. When you have a group, they could be doing something else while you do another thing at the same time. However, having to do all that stuff by yourself slows you down and might not have time to finish. Your group and you are all doing something and that makes everything go quicker because your not doing it all by yourself. If you work alone you could be stressed and have to think of all the ideas. Working in a group can really bring more ideas to the stuff you and your group are working on. Also, you can divide the work with your group members and make things faster. Second, sharing the ideas with your group can be helpful. It can also be very fun working with other people and having different opinions around. Someone in your group can be the most creative person and really help out on what you are working on. If you dont share your ideas then whats the point of being in the group. Everyone needs to have something to say and something to work on. If you work alone you will miss the opportunity to have someone helping you and have an opinion on it because when you present it, other people might something to say about it. Working alone can be frustrating and exhausting for some people because when they dont know something on one will be there to help them. Also, having to work alone might make you to multitask a lot and difficult for you to finish on what you are doing. Last, shows teamwork and that teamwork makes everything better than having to work alone. When you show teamwork with your group it shows that all of you can be leaders in that group. Working in a group can be really fun because you be partnered up and meet new people or be with the same people you know and make the work effort exciting. When being in a group, you can your part while everyone else does theirs and it makes everything go quicker. In conclusion, I would prefer working with a group than working alone because working with a group make things much easier and less work too. I wouldnt want to work alone because I wouldnt have anyone to discuss and share my opinions with. Having to do all that work by yourself can be very difficult in the process; things may not come out the way it should. Also, when you work alone you might not have many ideas to think of and with a group you can. Working by yourself may not be as much fun as in a group. If you had a group you would be able to divide the work, but working on something by yourself probably make it two times harder. Thats why I think that working in a group is more beneficial than working all alone.",9,8,8,8,8,8,1130,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
93,3629,FEAF4F517583,"To begin with, there are different opinions about to do something beyond of what we have already mastered and for that reason we will never grow. Some people idea is that if they have already their master they will stop there, but thats not the point. I believe that we have to keep trying and learning until the end ; for example, if you never try something different you will never grow. Im agree with author Ralph Emerson and here are my reasons why: One reason, is you will have more experience. Experience make people rich and I am not talking about profit. For example, if I go to apply for a job and I just have a high school diploma because all I wanted was a high school diploma, but there is another applicant that have more than a high school diploma he also have a diploma as a plumber. This applicant have more experience and more masters, he prepared himself more than me , so he will get the job. Sometimes in life we have to be ambitious in a property way. I am agree with author Ralph because learning differently means growing. The reason is I will be more mature, for example ; I will gain more mature because I have learned based of my mistakes, moreover will be easier for me than another person that just stayed with the easiest. There are many people that give up at the first try; although, life is not easy but at least dont give up at: the first, second and the third try. Another reason why trying something new of what I already have is I can reach more goals; in other words, at this time in society your value depends a lot on what you have, you can more privileges if you have more goals earned. For example, my goal is to be a police officer but after I reach my goal I will keep looking for a highest range, and that will make me grow: economically, physical and mentally. In addition, while you are mastering new goals you will be growing at the same time. In conclusion many people is not agree to this idea because many of them like the easier, but the easier is not valuable .There will be many obstacles, and people will think that is the end; consequently, they will not grow sufficiently to know that the most they try the most opportunities of gain they have. However, in my opinion is never late to continue learning because; The more we learn that more we know, and the more we know the more we grow.",7,6,6,6,6,7,3880,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I wasnt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends wont try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you dont think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that didnt last. Now im in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, cant stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her.

Although some say that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment . Actually it shouldnt because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. Some say that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classrooms because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. For example one day my English teacher told me that she let her students to use their phone during a test to search something about the meaning of the words that they doesnt know. Then, she told me that she told them that they can only use their phones to translated the words that they doesnt know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students the test and she went to seat to her desk, but then she was observing that one of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to see what the student was searching and she saw that the student was searching for the answers of the questions that the test have. After that, she saw that one of the others students was taking pictures of the exam, she went to see why the student was taking pictures of the exam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of the exam and he told her that he was sending the answers to his friend who was sitting in the back seat. Moreover, she told me that the other day that she was explaining the class, some students were using their phone and paying less attention to the class. Also, she says that the students who were using their phones during the class when they got the test they doesnt know what to answer because they were distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in the exam. I believe that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there are students that when the teacher is explaining the class they are using their phones and when the teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can be a problem because their grades can get very lower. Those who believe that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment. One example can be my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in the book about the Civil War or World War II. He told me that its very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in the book because the books doesnt have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he doesnt know how to summarize the meaning of the paragraphs that the book have. However, when the teacher let him use his phone he began to search about the tittles that he have to search and he says that its more easy for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live ( those are learning games that sometimes the teachers use to help students to study ) he learn more than when he read a book. In my point of view I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because for me sometimes is very complicated to read a book because there are some words that I dont understand, but when I use my phone to search its more easy because in the phone there are some meanings that I understand . In summary, some say that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classroom because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. However, some believe that cell phone should be allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because it easy for me to search the meaning of a word that I dont know and I feel that I learn more then treading a book.

Im pretty sure if yall love each other the argument wont really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude.

All the money that we used to spend on junk food has been going to an index fund, that will be used once we finish highschool. It wiil be used to start a company.

Some people think that the school should take control of the students extra activities and extra time. They feel that students need more educational activities to enrich their knowledgement at school. I believe that students should decided what they want to do with their extra time after school because some students have to work to help their families, some students have to get home earlier to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work and students like to do some other activities like sports, art or homework. First, students have to work to help their parents and sibilings, it could be difficult to work and study at the same time, you get tired and all you think is get home and sleep, students who work do not have time to study for a quiz, test or do homework. However. Study hall could help them finish their homework, students who work dont get involved in extracurricular activities bacause they dont have time to make it through. But also they work for saving money for college, this is an a good idea because you are investing for your future. That is why students who work have to give up with some other acctivities that they want to do. Second, some students have to get home early to take care of their sibbilings while their parents are at work, most of them cant afford a babysitter, this students might have the time to involve in a club, probably when one of their parents have a day off. They can do homework or other assigments for school or home while they are taking care of their sibbilings like made food for them, clean the house, laundry etc. That can get difficult for them because they have different responsabilities at the same time that they have to take care of school. Third, other students like to do different activities like sports, they like to exercide everyday after school, there are many sports that hey can practice such as bascketball, baseball, tennis, gymnastics, etc. other students like to do art, envirroment and learn another language they can sign up for any club that they are interested on.

Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she cant leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family. I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on.

The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL she couldnt help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didnt know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google. Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didnt allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary. In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google. Cell phones are also taking away people paper dictionary from student , student really struggle when they go for testing and cell phones are not allowed. Cell phones are like drugs to youth they are getting addictive to it. ",7,6,5,5,4,5,3802,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends. The first reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we cant talk with our families that are in long distance. And we dont know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. Thats why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because its important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you cant go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you cant come today, if there was no technology it wasnt possible to do these things. Second reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However thats good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you cant drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money. Third reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you dont know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you cant ask question because you dont know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you cant talk or ask them for help. Thats when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

109,2910,13450D581EC9,"I am agree with the Waldo Emersons prompt. He wrote that "" to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" ""Never give up."" This word conveys our intensify about our thought. It makes us courageous. Life is not a bed of rose, life is struggle. Every single person has their life struggle. Nobody is a perfect at they look. A perfect man is he who win the struggle. A successful man, he not get success in a second. He had lot of struggle in his life,but he dont stop for his goal. After long time keep trying made him successful. He adjust the struggle and keep go through the struggle and win the struggle which is make him success. For example a soccer player has his goal to make a score so that they can win. But for making a goal he has to cross the against team then he will success to make a goal. You failed !. You are done your life today. We couldnt expect from you this. You fool !. You looser. Now you go home and get sleep thats all you can do. Should I listen them and do what they want or give up my life? NO!.I am failed, i am looser but it dosent mean that i cant win anymore. Dont lose hope. You have hand,you have brain,you have leg use those one day win come to you then you can show them that you did. you made it. For example,you are not good in Math but its dosent mean that you are bad in Social Science. Show your talent. You cant able to solving the Math equation but you have talent to make Social Science rules. Time is valuable more than everything. A good minded people use their proper time. If you use time and you failed in your success then dont lose hope,dont stop, dont blame on time and yourself. Time can give you more opportunity to use it and make yourself successful. You just have to keep try. But if you being lazy you just waste your time and you got looser reward from the time. Always remember that time never gonna come back. For example, If you dont do your homework the teacher not gonna give you a grade. You gonna fail in this subject. You just waste your time. But if you do the homework but is incorrect. The teacher can give you one more time to fix the correction though its incorrect. An Inspiration can make your goal. If you look or read about successful person how they became successful in their life you also can inspire to do what they did. An inspiration can bring you encourage. Make you sense what you want to do and what should you do for your future. There are different people has their different choices. From the successful people you can organize your life. For example, there was a story about Robert Bruce and a Spider. One day Robert Bruce was laying in the cave and saw a spider was trying to climb the wall but its failed seven times to reach the wall of top. After seven times keep trying makes its successful. The spider reached the top of the wall. This event make Robert Bruce inspire himself. Everything has their opposition. If you wanna be a good man you have to know what is bad things. The same way if you want to win you have to know what is lose. Fail is common afire in human being. If you dont fail its mean you dosent even try. Fail is a part of our life. But dont get depressed yourself by depression. You fail but you have more option to start it from the beginning again. Before you stop try just think should i try one more time. Maybe this time you can become a winner. Just one more think can bring your success. For example, You digging a soil for the gold. You dig almost come to the gold but this time you give up and stop digging the soil. If he dig the soil one more time he can see the gold which one he want. So always think one more time before you quick. An aim can make our decision properly. An aim less man cant success in his life. A right decision depend on your future. First make a routine for your work. If you want to success in your goal you have to follow your routine. In a student life its hard to follow the rules. But if you try you can do it. In student life student should give full attention to their lesson. homework should be done before going school or college. if you continuously follow the rules it will be easier for you to success your life. Dont be lazy. Lazy is a weak point in our life. From the laziness your life never gonna successful. So always do hard work until you done in your work. some people we have in our society they has dream but they dont wanna work. If you dont work how can you full fill in their life. Always keep try to get your dream. We have time we have life just try as much as you can. Some people in our society some times they messed up with your dream or your work. They dont wanna let you to do your work. This typ of people are very harmful to our life. They always bothering you cant lets you doing work. That time we should ignore them. Dont say anything with them. One day they will leave you automacilly. For example, if any person can bother you every day and if you ignoring him one day he will not interest with you and leave you. The success of life bring you happiness. You will feel proud yourself. If you show them that you did it then they will fell ashamed because they thought wrong think about you. So never be lazy. Always do hard work,keep try and think about it what should you do or not.

Based on my experiences, I disagree with this statement, first impressions are made by everyone but it is not impossible to change. Your first thoughts of someone. Everyone makes first impressions of people before even getting to know them by the way they dress, and looks. Some first impressions can be changed and some cant be. First impressions is a human thing, I believe that everyone has at least made a first impression of someone and their first impressions can be impossible for them to change or it can be changed. The way someones appearances can be affected by first impressions by so many ways. That is a major cause that is first seen. The way you are approached. My Experiences can be said some of my first impressions can be hard to change, or I can be wrong about someone and my first impressions can be way off,and that person turns out to be nothing like what I have thought. This statement can be argued from two sides. Sometimes it can be impossible to change what your first thoughts can but than other times it can be changed.

Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not. It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you cant. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we dont have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners. Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students arent going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend. In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up. All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life.

118,692,52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it. Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they cant because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state arent taken into consideration. Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they arent able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you dont complete youre gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, theyd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldnt have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace. Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isnt exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students cant spend a lot of time thinking because they dont have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and theres no better place to do that then home, the place youre most comfortable with. To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place theyre more comfortable with.",10,10,9,10,10,10,1083,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 10, vocabulary 9, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

If the students willing to sacrifice their time, elective course, and really work to get to their goal of graduating a year early then they deserve it. From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening theyre putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because: it could impress the collages theyd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time It would also be a great benefit for students whod join the work force instead of collage because: they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work theyd have a head start on their life The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year. in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.",6,7,6,7,7,7,1647,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier. First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, its good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didnt have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass. Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money. Students take classes at home at home because its more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because its more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me thats his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it. Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because its easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and thats what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future.

121,230,ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses. To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the students desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules. Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time. To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.

There are also other people who when it gets to having their own character traits they cant, therefore they get influence by others. Yes, we probably were influenced by other, but we didnt use all their character traits. Theres lots of people who try to be others but it always dose not work out. If you want to pop out like the others best chance is you being your true self. To begin with, weve been creating our own character traits since birth. We all learned how to speak, and walk differently. Your first word were most likely ""Dada"", or ""mama"". You kept watching shows that kept you entertain, or was it the games that made it entertaining that kept you going. Howd you learn how to walk, were you thought by your parents, or did you learn by yourself. it was either your parents were walking you, or you stood up and took your first steps. In addition, you never stay young, youre always growing, our parents always wish we wouldnt grow. But its part of life, now youre in the stage where time gets hard.

123,2593,305EFA6DBBBF,"Do we choose our own character traits? As the British naturalist and politican Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I certanly agree that everyone is capeable of choosing their own character trait, they are independent enough to have control over themselves, theyre capeable to choose in what type of enviroment they want to be in, or how to react to bad or good circumtances, at the end of the day we all have the freedom to choose who, and what we want to be. Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example; My grandma, shes a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, shes a very independent women who always says, ""If i dont do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times. Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be. Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character its really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but thats like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be. In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

I believe that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives in many ways. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effects on peoples lives. The reason why technology has a positive effect on people is because it makes most peoples life easier and therere cars that drive for you. For example, now a days you can order your grocery online and just pick it up at the store in a certain amount of time. This type of service allows people to be more confident on technology and it saves you some time. Therefore, manny people take advantage of the technology and use it for goods. In adition to that, technology allows you to get to place faster and safer. For example, they have cars that are design to drive by themselves.

By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy. Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. Peoples body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mothers friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mothers friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life. Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas. Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy. In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy. People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. ",6,8,7,8,7,8,3639,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

Most of the time we tend to think that because were adults we are doing the right thing, but instead were doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before youre life falls apart. Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that theirs no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with youre life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what youre going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions. The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured youll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case its easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with youre life. After all maybe guidance isnt a good place to go. One of the reasons that people dont seek for guidance is that its too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, youre not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does. In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices.

Most students when they are not interested in something will most likely not do good in that subject. If you put students in those classes when they dont want to take then the pass rate may drop in those classes. The music, drama, and art class should stay as electives for students that enjoy those classes. I do see how those classes can help a students with some aspects on life but if they dont want to be in that elective then they wont be as involved as everyone else. School is meant for learning and not just putting students in a class they dont like, its not a good way to teach students. If the student have a choose in what they take, then will students find it interesting and will want to learn more. The classes students choose to take should help them get ready for there future career. I am opposed to having classes in the arts as a required class but I do believe they should stay as electives. Since I am still a student myself, I know what it is like to be put in a class that I do not finding interesting. I do not feel as if the school should have the right to choose our required electives. Student should have a choose in what class they want because it appeals to them and its something they actually want to take. If a student choose that class they then choose it for a reason. Thats why if a student gets something they dont like, they are no going to be as engaged in that class and not learn that much as well. A student should have a right not to take the classes in the arts and schools should not make it a required class neither. If school makes those classes required then the pass rate is going to drop and students will not want to attend school as much because they are failing a class they dont even like. The schools should keep those classes as electives and not as core classes. There are plenty of students that enjoy taking those classes and that do really good in them as well. The classes in the arts are great classes to have a option to take while in school, it opens so many doors for students that want to make a career out of those classes. Im sure some students learn a lot of life lessons while taking those classes and has helped them in some way. I believe you can learn a lot of skills in those classes as long as your engaged in them and actually like the classes. School should keep music, drama, and art class as electives so the people that want to take it can. The classes students take should help them in there future career. If a student want to take a class that he want to work in as a career, they shouldnt be rejected to take it because the classes in the arts are required to take. For example, if a student whats to become a construction work, then I do not see how taking a music class is going to help that student reach his goal to be in that career. The things students do now while in school can change there lives just by simply making them take a class they dont like. There are a wide range of classes students can take that will better prepare for when they leave school. The classes students take now will help them but if schools make the students take something they dont want to take then will it possible ruin them. Thats why students shouldn not be required to take the classes in the arts and choose in what they want to take. I dont believe schools should me the classes of the arts so be required to take. But I do believe they should stay as electives in the school. Students should be able to choose what they take in school and they should take something that is appealing to them. The classes to have benefits to some of the students and is a great elective class to have.

Sometime dont you feel like your teacher is explaining something too fast and you dont really understand,Well the homework club can help you with that the homework club will get you a tutor to explain to you more about the subject.

The homework club also has lots of benefits because you can learn more than other kids and you can get special attention from your tutors so that you can learn more in class.

Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. Its always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, its always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well. Teens at a young age tend to become more interested in careers more than adults. Its a fact that a teenagers brain consumes 5X the information quicker then it would if an adult had. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires. Itll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it. When there is a young aged teenager, its best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and Itll be the introduction to their future career path. Teenagers play an important role in todays generation. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in. High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. Its always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how shes doing overall. The counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal. When providing options to a young age teenager, its best that you make it seem less work as possible. Teenagers most likely wouldnt like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. Nevertheless, its an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future.",8,7,8,8,7,8,2013,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success, it help in many way when talk to someone or when talk to costumer. Having a positive attitude help when working in a work place For example, when a costumer is giving a hard time instead reflecting back it better to respond with a positive attitude then a bad one. Then matter will turn out better. when reflecting back with a negative attitude the outcome isnt great it worst it better to smile then be mad. Its important to have positive attitude because there better outcomes having a better attitude is a big key to success it help when dealing a bad situation. Having a positive attitude change the way you see thing there much better outcome like seeing a smile on someone face because the attitude you gave them was positive and not negative. The action we do reflect on what is said or done, just like attitude reflect back. when giving the right attitude everything is better and there no bad responds or action done. The important of attitude is the emotion some gives when thing change for example, when a job gives a raise to someone the person attitude change because there happy. Small things changes a person attitude and a way of thinking. when thinking about the way your attitude can change in just a split second by the action taking place is pretty amazing how not only when someone is happy the attitude they show is better then it was before.

You might find it difficult to change your first impression because you do not know how others will react to you, you do not want people to remember your first impression especially if it was bad, and you do not know how its going to go. If you worry about how people will react when trying to change your first impression, it will make things more difficult for you to achieve that goal. Take your chances be confident and do what you have to do. There have been times where people can just look at someone and assume the worst about them. They could be going through a rough time and you may not even know that but you still assume the worst. First impressions may be easy and may be hard to change. First impressions are almost always remembered,that makes it difficult to change your first impression. No matter how many times you try to change your first impression some people will still remember it. First impressions are important because its how people see you. You always want to make it your best not your worst. Think to yourself about what your going to do before you do it, because many people will agree or disagree that first impressions are impossible to change. Not Knowing how your first impression is going to be is horrifying. On the other hand it can go great you just never know.

134,983,EEED5054938E,"I would disagree for adding a one hour and a half hour because maybe parents might be worried about their child or children at school for another hour or two. I would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. i would even say that i would not want another hour of school cause isnt seven hours of school enough already. I can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. What i would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have a extra hour or half a hour still because it can`t be the parents only because it`s not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are gonna have the extra hour. I understand that kids might want to do activities for their school or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments,homework,projects,PowerPoints,tests,and quizzes. I usually would`nt want to have another because it`s complicated sometimes doing stuff there and it is just to much for me to handle at one time mostly and i have to do a lot stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it`s a lot. If he or she doesnt want to stay they dont have to vote or say anything but other people might say something if they do want to have the extra hour or two i would speak up for himself or herself cause if u do want the extra hour or two go ahead vote or speak up for yourself and do your best to change the idea of the story or idea of the other people that would not have the extra hour. Now back to my disagreement about having another hour of school i would not have another hour of school because it is it much work for me to handle mostly cause the amount of work i have to do at school is so ridiculous really ridiculous cause the person or me has to write alot form time time and its worth it cause your getting a free education but i dont want alot of education i would want to stay me and me only.

136,892,A5567EF4C8EA,"I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected. First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like. Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career. Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money. In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help. ",8,6,7,7,6,6,2220,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Or do you just go outside for a walk? Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside. Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isnt a really competitive game and can be played alone, its better when its played with other people. Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isnt usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids. Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person.

However; when you try and keep trying somehting is when you grow up more and more each time. Additionaly, we grow more with stuff that we are good already, because we become more and more greatful. Primaly, we think that by trying what we already know, it makes us better each time. Generic_school made a survey to all seniors to get everyones opinion base on Unless you try to do something beyod what you have mastered, you will never grow. sevendy five percent of students desagree, they said that you learnd more and more of what ever you already know.

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we wouldent care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives. Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around. Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives. I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we shouldve been proud of what dident thad happen. So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you.

141,334,A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I wouldnt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch. Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that its disgusting. When I was younger I wouldnt eat at school and until this day I dont because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids dont eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school. When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woudnt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she didnt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I wouldnt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that wouldnt eat in school. I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren dont eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coudnt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve. In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.

Students can have a little conversation for get more information, then they can pick one or more ideas for make their work more easy . They can argue from each idea that could be more important.

For example, When I was in my country my teacher said that we can choose work together or alone, and I prefer to work alone because I thought that working alone was more beneficial for me but I was really confused about it. Working together help us to know different option and students can have more social communication. Working together imply to have less work. Students can be take more opportunities for learn new thing everyday, also that can help teachers too. Less work can be helpful for a lot students because they can realize missing work, extra work and other activities during class. Furthermore, I remember when I was in 6 grade my teacher said that less work can help you to have more time for you that means that sometimes with less work teachers and students could learn and have more progress. Some classes can be stressful for a many students because teachers need to realize all activities during their classes and sometime students do not understand what they need to do. Otherwise, working together would be more easy for students to finish their work quickly. One important fact in my life that I never forgot is when my English teacher said that we have just 10 minutes for take the exam, and everyone fail because he was very strict with us.

In conclusion, Working together could be very helpful for many students who need help for get better grades during the year.

I strongly agree with Thomas, because when Im feeling idle. I intend to get sad, or depressed, therefore never be idle. Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore heres some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job. Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, youll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle. My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now im not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us. My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasnt just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isnt easy.

146,746,D5E4F0C7D0BC,"Are educational activities enjoyable? There are many different kind of people that like different things. But, if you are a person that likes science this is for you. one educational activity is a experiment because there are a lot of people that like to record data and find out how something works. Many people like to like to record data, so they might really enjoy a experiment. For example, in a experiment that a person has to measured and put the data in a table. Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected. This is one reason why I think experiments are a enjoyable activity. In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not. This why I think a experiment is a enjoyable activity. Recording data and finding our how something works are just two reason why experiment is a enjoyable activity. People will fight just to record data. Other people will spend all their life doing experiment just to fine something out. This are the reasons I think a experiment is a educational and enjoyable activity. ",8,6,7,7,6,7,2983,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
147,728,67D58F9FA53C,"I agree with the principal because that what he said said all students hood at lest participate on a sport,club,or after school activitis. The principal wants students tp join sports maybe because he want some students to get on shape or to atend some after school activitis for example like a dance club to see how students do and art club to see how students draw and students council. The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game thats how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other .And students council i dont now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life. Okay this off the topic that we are talking about okay, all most every billoner drop of of school and collage to start what they wanted to do and what there dream was the did not stop it they all went for it Okay now this is back on the topic. I also disagree because some students need to do some at home like help there father or a family member o something of life or have to work in a reasterunt to help there family with bills or other thing like that is why some dont have the time to do any of dos after school activitis and others,or have to take care of a sibiling or a family member and dont have the time to stat for after school activitis for the cause of dos thing that I just said. And i disagree inone thing again some students just stay after school to finish a test,work,progetor a asy for the teacher or just stay to learn more about what there wanna do of the work or esy is wanna be about. But in one thing some not all students some hood really stay after like the ones that cant speak english, or the ones who need help on writing on english,or the ones who really need help to read on english . Or the ones that want to learn more about a other laenguech they can just stay in the same class that they have the leangucj they want to learn about and just tell the teacher if they can stay after or not no if the teacher is gonna stay after for then they can stay after and learn more of the leanguch they are learning about. The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means . So what I am trying to say is that yes some students hood stay after school to participate on one of this activitys the principal has probited for them i can help them on soemthing not like help them alot but just a little for the students know how it is to do something.",4,5,6,6,6,5,1346,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
148,3246,6AB2B78CE0AF,"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on peoples lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news. Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents dont get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because its on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesnt loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you dont know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language. Some people lives in another country or states and its hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You cant write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they cant meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at. Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks its fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology. Most people like that technology is growing because its better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABCs and 123s. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better. Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . Theres many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of peoples live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also its a good way to communicate with other people faster. ",6,7,8,8,7,7,1386,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

150,3007,FDCBCA9B0636,"Dear School Principal, I believe that students should have cell phones in campus. If they have something they always wanted from a school. Theyll be wanting to learn more. If theres a emergency somewhere where they cant get to the office immediately , they could use there cell phones to call other students to tell the teachers that theres an emergency. Parents wont be angry about this policy because theyll know that there children are learning in ways that theyll want to learn. So, if they know that they can use there cell phones in school they wont be using it during class hours. Cell phones are really use full to students during school hours. It keeps them safe and will help there education in how they will want to learn. You should really reconsider to allow students to bring there cell phones to school. It will be helpful to them. Students will think that education is fun now. And If you really look at it theres not much time of break or free time. The only time theyll use their phones a lot is during lunch time.

151,3639,78E8970D0C13,"I argree with haveing a afterschool homework club, because It well help out alot of students improve in school, and do better overall. also dont you want extral help when you need it? students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework cause it could be difficult. students dont really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go afterschool and do the work there teachers can help students out. for example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parntents has to pay that teacher. and some parntants dont have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work togather to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parntents would not have to pay alot of money to make they child good at school. a other example would be that students can stay afterschool with there teachers, but for a little bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club lets make it more than 47 minumies. More time equlas a lot of work getting compled. in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers dont feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest. overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.

154,3206,1D327ADD95AA,"Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on peoples lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started. Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. Peoples phones, computers, and even TVs now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted. Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era. People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed. Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.",9,8,10,9,9,9,386,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
155,3818,E060D90D6CB9,Dear Principal I dont agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress. If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishments in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything. If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldnt have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea. I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future. Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me. I wouldnt like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note.

156,2602,E91D1A0039C3,"Sometimes is really hard to get this opportunities. If students get the chance to learn about what they like they should take advantage of it. They might learn things that interested them. Although some students think this opportunities are useless, actually it opens a lot of doors at a young age to learn about the things they like. For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are. A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they dont have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they dont want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits. Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks. Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology. He took the class this year because he thought it could be interesting. Midway through the year he found out that he is not so good at it. Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it. They all should have a second plan in case plan A is not working so well. Everyone should be ready just incase there is a rush change, and they have to take a decision in less than a day. They have to hope the best and get ready for the worst. Some students think this opportunity is lame for not having what they want to learn about. Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind. I know if one of them fails me I still have the other one. This is why I should get the opportunity to go. I truly want to know if the careers I have in mind are what I want to do the rest of my life. If in any case there was not what I am interested in then I will try new things.",7,6,7,8,8,7,3387,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
157,228,A79B40F29DCA,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals. I used to be the type of person who wouldnt really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldnt have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldnt want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didnt deserve to be treated good. The reason I said its taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didnt want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldnt have been the best. My mom is the person whos always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since ive always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I dont want to be the person who fails them. Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work youre doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments. Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they dont know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself ""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I dont think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I dont think I did good on this essay but im going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right. In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and theres no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.",8,8,7,8,7,7,2241,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
158,3142,8A0A3FE01FE7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning wont give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and youll be getting more physical help in a classroom. Many like distance learning because its more flexible, but because its really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people dont like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means theyre missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they wont care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""its online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and wont have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done.. Numerous of computers systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom. All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesnt matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter.

159,2501,D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back! Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard. First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate. Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong. Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up. In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for. Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",7,6,6,6,6,4,2921,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

I would like to accomplish my goals in life; there are three thing that I would like to accomplish: having a success career, graduate from high school with an advance diploma, and studied the area of medical. I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community. My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad. My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries. My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people. Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout. Some people accomplish something and some people dont accomplish nothing. If people accomplish what they want, there, would be no purpose.

161,3844,F610B3CBF3DF,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesnt mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better. To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another. Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but its a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected. Having a couple of mistakes doesnt mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isnt perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful.",8,7,8,8,8,9,3669,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you dont going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" thats wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and thats going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so youre going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level. I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him "" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything. Another thing is that not everybody make it, is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad dont going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so thats why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life. In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

One enjoyable activity is playing soccer ,You dont need to have good skills to play soccer. Many teens play soccer or they are in a soccer team , because they enjoy it. I know there is a lot of enjoyable activities , but i chose soccer. I play soccer with my friends and family , we really find it enjoyable to go outdoors and have some fun together. Many kids dont like going outside because they think sports are boring , But they arent boring to me. In the summer time parks are open for you to enjoy activities with your kids and family. You can choose to do any activity you think is enjoyable for your family. Soccer is a sport that can help you keep you healthy and have a good body shape. Your kids will enjoy playing soccer with their friends outdoors. Many parents dont let their kids go places with their friends , because they think something bad might happen to them. Meanwhile , many kids like to play other sports that are different than soccer , but they still enjoy it. Soccer is the same as many sports kids do at school or at parks. Teens spend their time at parks playing many sports during the summer time. My family go to parks to enjoy the water and play games that they never played before. If i enjoy playing soccer i think you will too , why not have some fun and probably hurt ,but hope that doesnt happen to anyone. You feel free when you play a sport you like to play or you might want to try a new sport. Always try something new because there isnt a lot of time to enjoy moments like that. Also,I think someone might find playing sports enjoyable , because its fun playing outdoors with your family or friends. We have two seasons that we can play outdoors and you will enjoy it. Also parents will enjoy spending time with their kids. Why not take time out your day so you can spend time with your kids more. Yes , you might not like it but many people do like going outside to the park with their children. I think spending time with your kids will let them know that you care and love them.

For example there are students that are waiting to know forsure on what they want to do in life and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do so they can be successful in life. Another reason why students do not know what they want to do by the time they enter high school, some parents want there kid to do what they want when it should not be like that, that is also why students have hard time thinking on what to do in the future. Students should have to worry about there future so they end up being successful in life, and end up doing good in life and making your parents proud on doing thins that they couldnt have.

One of my life experience was me joining the swimming team. Theres times that i would wanna give up on myself. some other days, i would feel too lazy, extremely tired, or having lots of work after school. One night, i decide that its not the time to just give up on yourself, after everything what ive had done. After that night, whenever i thought this to myself. I went every single day to my swimming practice, also thinking thoughts of head to never give up. All this sudden, i became more successful ! i was a leader to my swimming team. My couch knew one day i would put more effort on myself, he always believed in me. Some other days, theres times after swimming club. I just wanted to hang out with my friends, to able make time for them to go shopping, walking down the park,go on the beach or having fun at their parties.

I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional. First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career. Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy. Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you. Because you like draw you take the career arquitec is good idea. The people inspired draw like building, the natural place everything is good. The people like arquitec to created building in Dubai is very nice I dont no but is beautiful in only imagination. Much person no have idea the important is the study in the life. Much young take to abandon the high school and decision working because no everybody have east opportunity other people need more working because not have more family.

178,2766,B2AD2177A42C,"People can form their own character based on what they choose to make it. A person is given the responsibility of choosing whether to do the good or bad thing. For example, if a person hears that their friend is in a bad situation and then choosing to help them out, they are showing that they are capable of make their own character. Others may say that people do not get to choose their own character because it is beyond their control. However, people can determine their own character based on how they want it to be because they know what steps they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for them, and they know what they want to become in the future. Knowing what steps to take will help the person make the right choice in defining their character. People tend to ask to other if the choices that they are making is the right one, but instead of asking others what they think the person has to be confidence in themselves that they are making the right choice. For instance, if a student wants a good future they have to work hard and study in order to accomplish it, and not choose to go the wrong way. On the other hand people may say that having a second opinion is a good thing, but that is wrong because it may cause them to doubt themselves. This is why people should first plan their transaction then take action on it. People have the free well to choose what they want to be and what is best for them. A person knows what their interest are, so they choose according to what they like to do the most. Furthermore, if a person finds a job that they really like and want to get it, they will work hard for it. Some may disagree with this because others may see that what they are choosing to do is not the best thing for them. This is why people need to think about their choices before doing anything. People can choose their own character and what they want to become in the future. People could choose to became; artists, actors, singers, or doctors because they have dreamed of becoming one of these seen they were a child. For instance, they would have to focus and work hard in order to achieve their future selves. However, others may say that it is impossible to become what you dreamed to be in the future because they will face may opsticals in their lives. On the other hand, if a person really wanted to become that person they will work intensively for it. A persons character can be constructed by how they choose make it because they know the course that they have to take in order to achieve their goal, they know what is best for themselves, and they know what they want to be in the future. For example, If a person wants something badly, they will work persistently for it. Another example is that, the person will prove to everyone that they are capable of achieving their dream, and that it is possible to get. People should choose to make their own character because they will be comfortable with their choices.",9,8,8,8,7,7,2403,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
179,628,75C950F8EA18,"Sucsses is the common word that we hear every day, and everyone want to became successful in their life. The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument. Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy. The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future. Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that. At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something. Because school is our main resourse of learning. ",5,5,6,6,5,6,1532,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
180,2890,81946793B89A,"Have you always wondered how your parents accomplished what they have for your future, How famous people like for example singers and world wide companys became so influential to the world. Well Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Now when you think about it, is it beneficial if your always doing something or do you think inactivity also serves a purpose? In my point of view I have to agree on what Thomas Jefferson has stated. You cant accomplish something without working for it and I will be listing examples on why I believe in a strong way that if you keep doing something youll be able to accomplish what you want. My number one example is my parents, Of course its unthinkable that your parents want you to have the best future that you can get but have you ever asked on how they got to this point in life. My parents are heroes for me in a lot of ways but the most important one is how they never stay idle. they work nonstop to make sure my future is bright. They even left their home country so I can have a better life here, They never stayed idle even until this point and theyve gotten pretty far. Second example would be singers, In this day in age believe it or not singers have great influence in this world. Thats because a lot of singers known to man never stopped singing or dancing. They always worked hard to become the number one or wanting to be someone in general that people would look up to. Like Micheal Jackson, Even when he sadly died to this day people still praise him for what he made in the pop music world. Or Snoop Dog and his ability to rap really fast which people gave him the title of rap god. Theres a lot more people that have changed the world because of music but I think they had the highest impact. Now the last example is companys and their founders per say. Car companys, or companys in general had or have someone who started it all, One big example would be Ellon Musk and his Tesla car company. After he made Tesla the best electronic car company to date he decided to keep moving forward with his plan to go all green. His made commuter vehicle and now his focusing on diesel trucks so there can be less pollution in the air and more safety for the drives. His making a lot of impacts in the world because his not just standing around waiting for someone else do it for him. I think Ive said enough and stand by my opinion that if you are doing something you will accomplish what your wanting in the future like how this other people have just like Thomas Jefferson wrote.

181,3554,9532BA8E40BA,"why is better to have summer break than have it in different time of the year? Some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall,and some people argue that should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 weeks break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I disagree that students should have a year-round schools because students will not learn if they have many breaks during the year, students would not have enough time with their families, and friends, also students would have hard time to do their work. First, Students will not learn if they have many breaks. I think that is better if students have summer break than have it in different sections of the year. for example; if students want to travel to other state for vacations they would have to travel a week before so they can have fun, but students have to come back a week before school start, and they will forget what have they been learning the pass months. the main point of this example is that there is no point of doing a year-round schools, because that would affect students. second, students would not have enough time with their family, and friends. Students travel every summer to other states to visit their families, and friends. for example; Most of the students travel every summer to other states or countries, but if students have year-round schools they will not have enough time to have fun with their families, and friends, also they would make less plans, because students would have to come back a week before the school start. from this example the main point is that students should have their vacations in the summer, and not in different sections of the year because they take time to those students, and when they go back to school they will not make any effort to do what they suppose to do. third, students would have hard time to do their work. they would not have enough time to complete their worksheets from school, because they were having fun with their families, and friends in other countries. for example; if most of the students travel to different countries or states, and when they come back home students will be tired, and lazy to do their work, but if they have summer vacations they will be exited to go to school, retain information as easily when they come back. from this example the main point is that students should have summer vacations so they can be exited when they come back to school, and be great during the school. finally, students would be more time in the school learning more, and paying attention to the teachers, also they will get their work done more faster, and students would be more positive to pass their SOLS.

If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher.

They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse. Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment. Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing. For example to study, many people do not like to study because they say that school is boring so that i am doing they believe that is boring. They will try to convence me doing wrong things so i have to demostrate them that i wanna be something else in a world not just have fun.

Sometimes people have no self confident and help then to built one,can be a really good praise, not apreciate someone else effort ,to make a really hard task for them, can give the impression of being a bad person or a person that does not want them to improve. Others believe that praise given to deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of self-steem is achievement. That being hard and strict with students would make them strong to commite their task. Students can broke easily, help them find a good way to improve is being a good teacher,praise them for mistakes but still telling them one way to keep going.",7,6,6,5,5,5,3393,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

They will leave you with a huge responsibility that you arent ready to take on. Is like tell a new baby bird to fly in the world that fill with danger things. Most people that graduate early goes through depression because they are loosing a huge part of their child hood. from my point of view people who graduate find a huge difficult in life because when they graduate,they will have that mind set it is good idea to take a year of college because they graduated early and when you rest for a year you start to forget everything you learn and when you go to t college you have less memory on what u learn in high school. For a student to graduate early they most have a lots of requirement to graduate such a good record responsible and have a plan in life. Graduating early is a wasted of time and effort.

190,111,5AAD796F4D6B,"Why having a good attitude tours someone can have good causes. Having a good attitude tours someone you just meet, can bring good actions like a great friendship or relationship, a reason for a person that wants to hang out with you is because that person thinks your great person and they would like to spend more time with you because you give them a good impression to them and they think your a great person. For example, lets say your mate wants you to meet his or her parents, so to give them a good impression you would have to, have a good attitude tours everything they say in order to give a good impression to them. another example can be work, having a good attitude at work can be a lot less stressful and more positive in your life and others coworkers because your not complaining of how difficult your day was, they have it difficult too, but maybe not having so much stress in your mind or complaining how life is treats you, you can even hang out with your friends or your coworkers time to time and make new friends or people like you even little more because at the end of the day everything would still be the same so be more positive.

Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example so people will trust you more , actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more and you can make a plant for take their attention. people can be convinced by looking at other people`s example because they think that doing what others do is better. In my opinion we should give more than one example to the people because one can not be enough for people who do not believe what other say, so what we need is more options where they can find their influences. Giving more than one option is giving them a chance to choose them what they can be influence by. some times we need their attention because that way we can convinced them that we are telling them the true and they will follow us and they will fell comfortable with them self. in conclusion giving more that a lot of choose to the people is better because they can choose what influence they want Although some say that giving your own example is the best way to influence others because you are giving a real example so people will trust you more , actually there are better ways to do it because if you give more than one example people is going to trust you more and you can make a plant for take their attention.",7,6,8,6,8,6,2950,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Two years ago,in 2017,me and my best friend,Generic_Name,are ready for our first day of middle school. We were excited to see each other,we were excited because Generic_Name moved 3 years ago, in third grade. I was sad at first but until my mom say that they move not that far,my mom takes me to his house every weekends. Now when we start school i gonna see him every day. It because we have the same class and i was happy we have the same classes together. When i got to school i see Generic_Name in a far distance and start running to each other like we never seen each other before for a very long time. Now we start learning classes together every day We where in English class to do a act of kindness to your best friend or closes friend. I say i was gonna do with Generic_Name,but then Generic_Name mom called him from the front office to pick him up. i said to Generic_Name what going on,he said ""i dont know"". soon after he didnt came to school for four days i was getting worried if his family are okay. i called to him many time,but he did not answer. until Monday he came to school looking sad, i said,""what happen"",he said that his grandma was very ill and might not make it .I felt sad too because his grandma was like my grandma.

195,72,BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ? A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Todays many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score. The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down. The second reason,Todays in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing. Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone. However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word. In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media.",7,7,6,6,5,5,2587,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
196,805,367781F47105,"Most students in high school who would be looking forward to attend college barely have enough time to even get a part time job. They would work as hard as they could for a better and brighter future. For that specific reason,committing a career by the time they enter high school would be a bad idea for the students. They would need more knowledges,they would be too young to to decide,and that could also ruin their dreams. Students should not commit a career by the time they enter high school because they would not benefit from it. firstly to begin with,lack of knowledges could not only destroy their dreams,but also them. They would not have enough experience. Everything would be confusing for them because they didnt have a chance to learn them back in high school. One thing for sure,they wouldnt be good at it as well as they would be if they finished high school and attended college. Also,they wouldnt be as open as they should be. Secondly another,being young and have to decide something that is going to be a big part of their future is the hardest decision. They might regret it in the future. There is a fifty percent chance that theyd change their mind when they grow up. When they are young,scared,and have pressure on them they usually make the worst decision,but later in life when they would finally realize it. Itll be too late to fix it. They also would even blame their parents in some kind of way. Also,that one decision can ruin their life and dreams completely. They wouldnt even be interested in going to college. They might drop out high school when they would start recieving checks because they need money and they get it at least every week,""so whats the point of going to college"",they would think. They would also need more time to think and decide what they really want before choosing something they might regret. In conclusion,not only high school students,but every other kids in general have the right to have enough time to decide what they want when they feel ready to. They need to finish high school,go to college,and have a chance to choose what they want to be. When they dont have enough experience they are usually shy and scared when doing something because they dont know what they are doing.

Like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i dont have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could. For Example: some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries. For Example: Some of the people dont have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes. For Example: There are some kids that dont go to school, having the school next to them, but theres alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they cant because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs. For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she cant because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesnt have time but she would love if she could do it. For Example: My dad hes going all the way to DC for school because he is taking classes for duster he pays each moth and my dad works to in countruction but weekends she goes to DC the classes start like at 10 and they end like at 1, if you like someting work hard for what you like. For Example: I have a friend that he takes online he works everyday, he takes his computer to his work so when hes on break runs to the computer and he starts school online like that someone that wants to progress in this country.

198,976,B459B5B87707,"Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Dont they need any break. Even machines dont work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Doesnt the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you dont get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ? High school isnt just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face. Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesnt serve a purpose. If you cant have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Human beings dont need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day. More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell no sometimes. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools. Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school. In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. We hope to do so much but cant accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.",5,7,7,6,6,6,2427,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they dont have a lot of time to share with they families. In my case, I love when its summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I dont need to do and dont pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going. The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life. I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people cant to share with special people. Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic. I dont agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you cant enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I dont be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family. I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you dont thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I cant go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there. Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you dont not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time. Dont take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better. In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more. For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family. So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when its time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more. And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students dont have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when its vacation they going to pass time with their Parents. You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything. The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead. And I think when its summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when its time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review. Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation. So enjoy, teachers dont thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",4,5,7,6,5,6,797,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

First you can choose your own character you just got to know about the person life in what the person did back when he was a teenager in what the person became when he start getting older. In my opinion choosing your own character would make you realize about things that happen back then when everything back then was really dangerous for example they had slaves,mudered people, treating people badly, people been racise and more that people did in we still have on this day because people dont want to listen or they just dont care about what they are doing with there life like can we atleast have peaceful without seeing peoepl dying or taking childrens from there mothers. As you can see life from back then was kinda different for example mothers would marry their own children they would have children with their own child they would force you to marry a old man that you dont even wanna marry or have kids with a old guy that you dont even love this why its good to do your own character because you be searching for information that you dont even know about in it be very interested. First of all you have to include for information about your own character or if the character formed by influences beyond or control by anything many characters be having there own influences in you gotta find it out to see about or if they are controlling anything for examples like a kingdom,slavery. and being part of a war. As you can see when been through so many wars in some characters be soldiers or a leader of a war to teach his soldiers how to fight a war when they get into a war. For example british soldiers has fight so many wars with alot of countries they either fight for stealing food or because they own them money they do not want to pay them back or because they have a little issues going on between them in they fight to solve their issues. As you choosing your character you can be creactive with it like you can put somemany things that you need like examples, reasons why you choose this character, get ideas for your character , give alot examples find anything you can so your character can have so many information that it is need it for your character. choosing our own character might be a little hard but we got to find a way to get all the information for it so we can start writing about them in how when find this character interested in we got to know alot of things that this character you are doing has a good information and you want to be curious about. This quote or prompt helps to figure out about a character that you would like to talk about in what to know about it to see if it helps you later on, in to see what they did to help other people about everything that they went through in this help the students to see that been on a war it is not easy because you are trying everything you can to be alive like searching for your own character it is very interested because you want to see about them in learn alot about the in how they did everything they could to help eachother in to see how we fight for the equal rights alot more thngs that we know now. My conclusion- how to choose your own character can be easy for you to write about in to find alot of things and important thigns that you would need for your character when you are putting your examples to a five page paragraph about how this character do alot of things in his past and to see if he still doing ,more things now in then. In by you choosing this character would make you realize alot of things in how everything happen back then when people was just trying to live and survive.",5,5,6,5,5,5,666,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
202,2630,4F89EB8CB97F,"I think this is a great idea, normally a person graduated in four years, but if we graduate en three years of school it will be the best for our future, because we can take advantage, start college one year early, and finish it one year early, and it will better for any student who wants to take advantage in life. I think it will be better but this is going to be hardest because you have to study more time, and have classes in summer, and evenings but all effort has its rewards. If two girls are in High School one of these (person A) took the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, and the other one (person B) took the traditional four years. The person A graduated from high school in 2015 and the person B in 2016. while the person A was studying her first year in college and working, the person B is in her last year of school, obviously 2019 is the last year for person A in college and graduate from college will help her to work in something about her career. Well what I do is if I graduated in just three years I will take advantage for work hard and take some few classes before go to college all the fourth year, and then the next year I will have a good amount of money for college, and when I going to college I keep working but less hours, I think this of allow high school students to graduated in three years is great idea. Knowing that the students only have three years in high school it will help the students to put effort in high school and to finish early high school and college. If more students are interests in this program it would be better for everyone, because you are going to graduate in three years, you are going to college, and then you are going to be a young professional. I think that if you are young and professional you will have more opportunities to have a job in everywhere. people is going to say that the high school is going to be more difficult because you are going to have many classes in only three years, and that you will not enjoy your vaccation in summer or can not do something that you like in evenings, but how I said before all efforts has its rewards.

Making this plan, students will feel comfortable to decide good things for their school, students can also share ideas with you and make different plans for a good change at the cafeteria, just think about it and you will see good results in students of your school. If students decide to have a different menu of food... ""This might be a great idea for student to try different kind of food and make this change every year, the good thing about making this is that student will not feel tired for be eating the same kind of food every year."" ""Students will feel excited every day to go to the cafeteria and see the new menu of food at the cafeteria."" ""Some students might have a favorite food but they can try different varieties of food and have new favorite food.""

Also, there is Latinos who copy other Latinos accent trying to be cool or staff, and its not make sense, because that means they do not love their own country and do not have self-steem. Because with that theyre showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, thats no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say. For example, if someone say that they like short hair, someone else do it to feel a little bit of atention. What I want to get with that is,that they is another people who do not have atention or love and start doing things to their friend or other people start to pay them atention.

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person. A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that hes must depress or sad because non of them know the truth.

207,881,0AFC8CE27321,"By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because youll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career. I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that theyve had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them. Students who commit to a career at a young age are usually athletes, or they plan on working in their family business. Pursuing your career needs a lot of hard work in school especially in this generation because youre going to need to go to a good college so you need a good GPA because youre going to want to go to the college that has a good academic program for the career that you plan on pursuing. Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, dont hire anyone without a college degree. Finally, thats what I think about choosing the right career for yourself, and committing to a career at a young age. although some may still believe differently and disagree with my view on this issue.

208,818,092BBD374359,"""Hey I had fun reading this book with you"" , younger student said. Kids especially younger ones love the older students because they make everything cool and fun. Since some schools have a program where they pair up a younger and older student together to help both of them. The program could help both of them learn something cool, interesting and the older ones can learn how to assist a kid and could share different opinion that they cant share front of the teacher about learning. One way the program can help both younger and older student is by. They both can learn about something they have never learned or what they young want to learn about. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say different stuff that they are learning. The older can each them what they are learning in class. This could be a mini deal that both have with each other and it could help. Another way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The older ones are almost ready for job. He could learn more about how to control a kid and teach them or assist them. The younger kid could tell them ways and teach them. This could lead to a good bounding with older students. I think they would see each other after years and be like I know who you are you were the one who assisted me. Last way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The feeling a student has is like why are we doing this. Is this even related to anything. They would able to give there opinion what they think about the topic or subject. Mostly students are shy front of class, but that would be only person to person, they wont be shy. This could help the students explain there self. I think it would make both of them feel comfortable. I think this program would help alot of the students confident to talk to people and learn in a fun way. This help alot of people I am one of them. When I was in 6th grade I was a reading, so I read books with my reading buddies it was fun. You get help in subject you need help in it makes everything easy. This program could help you in different problems you have. It will incourage you to learn more, so you can tell your helper.

209,2548,39492CE9549E,"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, ""I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days"". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scared to complete the test before the timer goes off because I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future. Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakes in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said ""I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even though you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job"". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focused and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the year I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projects teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy because most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible. Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.

If the school board spend over 6 millions to the electricity every years then how many millions for every thing else. The school board will not have a lot of money let to updates the school.

Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes. First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher.

In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people. To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged. Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. Thats one of the best ways to conserve cars energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas. Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that dont have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well. Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs. In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources. Firstly: conserving energy light and food and saving gas and money, having extra time for work, friends and most important: Family.",6,7,6,7,6,7,3246,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
216,3490,4002D91C6B6C,"In some school districts they offer programs which allows students to graduate in three years rather than four years as normal. Which means students would be a year early for college and a year early in the workforce. Allowing high school students to graduate in three year is not a good idea because they wont be able to attend more elective classes in school, they will start stressing about a lot of school work, and they wont be able to enjoy their four years of high school with friends. Trying to graduate early is not the best because it could be so stressful, focusing on getting good grades and passing in a short amount of time. As the University of Virginia did an experiment on teenagers, that which they should not be putting too much stress on themselves. As some students like to work and want to succeed in the future so they think its faster and easier to graduate early. You should be in high school for four years as traditionally and not trying to rush through your high school years and graduate. You should enjoy your years of high school, as normal sometimes we have stress because its too much of work, but four years you get to have more fun classes. As three years you wont be able to be in elective classes, which it could lead to less opportunities. During summer you have to do school work so you can be able to graduate and also after school you have to do work. Some might think that four years of high school is too much but its really not that much, you really wont feel when the years pass by. In the other hand some students think that being in high school for only three years its a good idea because they think that its easier to get away from people and dramas, faster to start working, going to college faster, and they are rushing through life. They want to succeed but the faster way and they dont want to be in high school because they think its too long and it takes a lot of years through their lives. As in some school districts they offer programs which allows students to graduate in three years rather than four years as normal. Allowing high school students to graduate in three years in not a good idea because its too much stress about school work, they wont be able to be in elective classes, and they wont enjoy their high school years with friends.

217,569,5E3EA4C47C9A,"The author Ralph Waldo Emeson wrote, to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment . I agree with Emerson statement about individuality because Ive actually seen people end up in big problems tryng to pretend for the world. . In the world we live in we cant even hide from the act because its in out tvs and advertisement . If Im being honest there is no benefit from this whole act of changing for the world in order for them to like you . My favorite rap artist is Tekashie Sixnine who has recently been on the charts and hot 100 in America for his songs . The main reason he got all those views and streams was because he was puttting up a front and prenting to being someone else in his lyrics . This artist has even been also been skating on thin ice for awhile . He has also created and posted on the internet videos of him doing crimes which lead to his arrest in november 20 2018.Tekashie is now serving jail time for trying to prove to the world that he was a big time gangster. My other reason for me to agree with Emerson statement about indivuality was because our lives has changed now that the advertisemnt is telling you change and look a certain way . For example I use instagram every single day and fifthy percent of the time the ads are about weight pills and cool clothes which have gang related logos on it now people buy these clothes and arent even part of gang related activity because the market is influence you to buy it . People can easly fall for the trap thats why you should always be yourself no matter what . Now to my last reason as a human being Ive made mistakes and Ive learned you always have to be yourself from those mistakes. When you are trying to act a type of way the life choices you will be making and friends you hang around will matter . You can be acting for your friends and end up in jail due to to the way yo were acting to make your friends happy. I think its much better to be yourself and too see that as a accomplishement because we are all now in a tech phase were web presents is a big deal and people go at any risk too achieve that goal . I for one can say that it is hard to not act like anyone becuase I came from Canada to america and I didnt change and it benefiting me because I making better choices . These are the reason why I agree with the statement author Ralpgh Waldo Emerson made about individuality .I also think that everone thats trying to achieve something good and do something with their lives should aways keep in mind to be there selfs no matter what .

218,393,D99C71A15BA0,"Society said that the first impression are almost imposible to change. But, I am totally disagree with that because there many people in this world that when they go to their first interview they dontknow how to dress up for a interview and they may not have have someone to show or teach them how to act, how dress up or how important is to be on time when they have interviews or when theyre going to meet someone important. It could be a girl or a boy that theyre interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be. But if theyre really interesting on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their really good impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want ,they will search or obtain imformation on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when youre meeting someone you are interesting on. For example,If i want a job that is really flexible and easy and thats my first time getting a job and I am dont no nothing about how to be dress up, how to act infront of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because its how it works,If youre late to an interview or a place when you will going to meet with that girl/boy they will left or they may not interview you. However, If explain them what happend at the first date or interview that i wasnt presentable or on time they may gave me a second chance to do it and thats where Im going to be at least 10 0r 20 minutes before on that interview or on that date that they gave me and be presentable and known how to act infront of them. They will like it and there you will gave them a second impression and they will gave you that job or you will have the chance to meet more that gir/boy that you like really bad. In conclusion,there is always a second chance to show or gave people a second impression that they may not believe that you can do it. Finally, people can not judge people at the first time,they may gave them a second chance or explain them how to do it an that way they can be successful in life and they can make you happy if you get love each other.",5,5,6,6,4,5,3046,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
219,645,35A1342EF397,"Is it good for a high school student to graduate in three years instead of the four year traditional? Lets call it the high school shortcut. Some school districts offer this opportunitie to high school students in order to make them graduate one year earlier. Based on my personal perspective, an early high school graduation is a very good experience for high school students. The high school shortcut makes student motivated to think about building their future quickly, increases the degree of their maturity and also help those students to proceed in life easily and faster. High schools should make sure that students are motivated to think about their future and help them by making sure theyre in the right path. Some students dont try to enter college right after graduating, some of them will take a year off and some of them dont try to enter college at all. By motivating to think about their future a mean that they would propably be more motivated to enter college at a young age than a certain type of age. Going to college and start chasing your dream at a young age will make students more mature. Life after high school is something serious weither you go to college or enter the military starting it at a young age would make students more ecxited and make them became mature at a young age. So with the high school shortcut students will have the ability of gainning a lot knowledge about the branche they want to study young and quicker. As soon as the high school students gain the knowledge that high school provides, proceeding easily and faster with the high school shortcut is and good opportunitie that should be chosen. Some of those high school students think that its a waist of time taking a four years high school knowing that a three year high school that provides the same type of knowledge is a possible choice for them. As far as Im concerned, I strongly believe that the high school shortcut which is graduating i three years instead of four years is a great opportunitie. Either students who wants to graduate early or even students who wants to take their time in high school should take advantage of this opportunitie.",8,8,9,6,7,7,697,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

225,501,0F3EC382C3CB,"The benefits of working in as a group or working alone. I believe working as a group is more beneficial for the students. My friend Generic_Name is very capable of doing school work by himself. However, even he needed others help to understand somethings. I am very capable of doing a school project by myself. However, even I could use some one elses input in the matter. I believe working together as a group is beneficial . For example, my friend Generic_Name he is a very smart person. He was on the top of the class with grades but, even he could not do it by himself. One day the teacher assigned us projects. Generic_Name decided to do it alone. On the due date, which was later that week Generic_Name turned in the project. The teacher told him he failed he did not understand why. The teacher later on the day took him aside and explained that he was not understanding the question. He asked her how he could make up the points for the failed project. Two weeks after that she assigned another project. She took Generic_Name aside and said this time work with somebody"". Generic_Name listed so he asked somebody to work with him. The day the project was due, he was nervous because he does not work with people often. The teacher told him they got a perfect score. The teacher took him aside and told him why he passed. She told him he passed because when you have more than just one persons input. Things become clear so when you do not understand something that other persons input can help. Another reason I believe working as a group helps is when I was in high school we were assigned a two part project. The first part I had to do by self. I got it done when the due date came the teacher told us to pick a partner. I picked a friend of mine, Generic_Name. The teacher told us to compare our papers. However, our paper even though they were on the same subject, they were very different. She later told us to now write a paper on the same subject but working together. When we were all done with the two parts she told everyone to rotate their papers to the right once. Everyone passed them on the teacher then told the whole class to read all three papers and to pick which one made more sense. When every one was done they all picked the one that made the most sense and gave it to her. Every single one of those papers she got were all the one people worked on together. She then asked the class why they did not pick the other one. They all said because the other papers were one sided as in only one perspective. Some students may say working alone is better. However, Generic_Name and I both learned that in some places you need two sides to a story, argument and debate. If I would have gone on with my life thinking the way I thought before I worked with some one, it would be very different in some perspective. My friend Generic_Names life would have been very different too. Thanks to the team work skill and the skill to listen to other peoples side, Generic_Name and I can make decision with some one instead of just making it alone. I recommend you talk to your teacher about this and get more group projects going. Talk to your parents about how you could use those skills in the outside world, become surprised by how much you use them, and by how easier your life become. When you do not have to make decision alone, decision making becomes much easier.",8,6,7,7,8,7,202,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
226,3440,DE0F5C13960F,"Have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well its pretty useful. The idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies. One reason why I argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family,spending time with your friends,and even go to the movies. If you do your homework at the homework club you wont have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. If you dont go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills arent meet. Secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together,check each others papers, and quiz each other on it. If you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time. Video games are very fun and addictive but you cant play if you got homework in the way. If you get you homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. Some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids dont do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club. In conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. Homework is really important and kids very often dont do their homework and thats probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to got to school.

If we have online class it can be hard to these people who got distracted for anything .Once I had a friend her name was Generic_Name, and she had a online math class that she needed to be able to graduated.

228,1269,E36B406AFE70,"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but its actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest. While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed On weekends, when im at home and im lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think hes doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time. When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or ill be caught in a family emergency. Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isnt always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if im idle.",8,7,8,8,9,7,3275,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time. The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money. So theys think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility. The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow.""

230,3187,168958FC7315,I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because. Most parents only get off work at 4:00 and they need to be home before their kids. Also if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. First parents need to be home before their kids because. If they leave work early to get home they will get paid less. If they get paid less they will not be able to pay for their kids college. Or out of school activities like horseback riding and soccer. Or even paying for a nanny or a babysitter to watch their kid so they can get paid more. Second if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. If people learn more and get smarter they will have a higher a chance in getting in to a good college. If they get in to a good college they will have a higher chance in getting a good job. If they get a good job they will get good money to help their families out someday. In the conclusion thats why I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day. Thats why you should accept my position.,6,6,6,6,8,8,308,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
231,3291,8A6FEEA6C0D3,"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world. Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the ones that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them. People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set. I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams. All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",7,6,7,8,7,6,1836,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

233,2395,6C98327DA084,"Explain how small acts of kindness can have a impact on others? Did you know that if you pick up trash out of your way or someone else way you can actually help them think about why did they not pick up trash. Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality? You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him dont just answer ""I dont know"" if you actually dont know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about. Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they dont any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn. kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone. In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",7,7,6,8,7,6,1412,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

236,3076,8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study? Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school. In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, students grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved. Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying. Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken. In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken.

However some people they dont have the opportunities to going to schools but they pay a class for online maybe they work the all day and they wants to studies, for example, the hispanic people they work immigrant to this country but the work hard to pay the rent and other bills but some people they wants to learn English to have a better wrk so for the reason they pay for online class becuase thyey wants to learn other language or they wants to have a better job so for the reasons is benefit for they pay for online class however not everyone have the same oppotunities.

238,3278,C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student gets to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for. The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. Thats all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student puts his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them.

But thats only some schools, some schools dont even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade.

239,133,25BFEA75C65A,"After reading the prompt I might think we have to make some change to the school like, what was said in the prompt we have to change the school days to a four day school week and make them to be two hours long. it can give people the hours that they need for other things and can give them time for project and stuff of that matter. The reasons why, I think we should do this because we can get more hours in the day to do things like for example: sports,homework,helping others, getting more rest in the day because maybe some people might not get more sleep during the night,some people might have job, students might have to go with their parents on a trip to somewhere or some place or also a school trip that they might go on. I well think that this is a good position to be for the change of the hours but to ever good thing there must be a bad like, a bump in the straight road ahead of you. I think for myself I do agree but there are some people that might not agree with my train of thoughts. The people who many not agree will probably say that there are not many hours in school to do things like learning new things. My train of thought thinks that we must go this way of the four day school week plan. There are so many beliefs of going this way that means we can save more resources and teachers can plan things up ahead for his/her students. I must say that there are some disadvantages of students having a four day week of school like students forgetting the things that they were teach in class and students can also not be ready for class. Some in conclusion: there are bad and good thing of having a four day week of school plan but there are some disadvantages of having it like what I said people might disagree with you but dont let them change your own train of thoughts. people also might not agree with your own believes but dont let them change who you are but the disadvantages are hard but the students can probably somethings pull it off.

Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school thats a lot of benefit for people that dont work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school. Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason. Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you thats helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home. Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they dont have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work. Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the dont have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they dont have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online thats going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",5,5,5,4,5,5,2017,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

In conclusion is the same thing if they change the five-days for the four-days of school, because they are going to spend the same time or maybe more than they think, but not is a good idea , for the students who have a part-time job after school. They no want to lose their jobs for that change, and is going to be the same charge if they change the schedule. That is why is not a good really idea for school.

Painting landscapes is a really good job too because you are doing what you want doing a really good art and a lot of people like how it looks like they pay a lot of money for the landscapes if you do a really good job. I chose stalyst professional because is interesting to do, you learn a lot about girls hairstyles and boys hairstyles I think is a really good job because a lot of people likes to do hairstyles and people likes to do haicuts because there is a lot of different things for example new hair color or a new hairstylt and stalyst is a really good job because you get a lot of money and you can do whatever you want with your own money but working hard. I think the workplace will be in a place that there is a lot of people, because when is people they are interesting to have new haistyles for example if someone goes to have a new hairstyle and is really cool people are going to wish have the same hairstyle or a different hairstyle.

246,2849,89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule. First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development. Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the schools building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else. To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.

248,3839,CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is. The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year. The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year. Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they dont forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year. In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Dont fix it if it aint broke.""",10,9,10,8,8,8,2806,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 10"

I really think that if we want to be success in life, we have to be positive on everything, a lot of famous people said that for example, Michael Jordan said: the key to the success is to be positive. We have to be positive on everything that we do if we have a negative attitude everything is going to be negative, maybe we are going to fail but that is another key to the success, that means we are doing everything well, but if we fail, we have to keep trying and never give up, until we get what we want, Michael Jordan said: I fail a lot of times but, that is the reason why I am who I am. There is going to be bad moments in the journey but that does not mean that we are done, we have to be positive and think positive, because for everything there is a solution. But another key to the success is to be humble, when we get what we wanted we have to remeber from where we come, be positive is important, but be humble is the most important thing.

Having a positive attitude has great benefits when it comes to work place,your personal business and even life in general, being rude or disrespectful to people wont pay, there is a saying that says what goes around comes around, so if you treat people with a negative attitude, in the near future somebody will treat you the same way. Attitude is very important in life, attitude determines if your going to be a better person in life or a bad person, attitude determines how well you are in treating people with respect. A good attitude goes a long way, even if you dont have enough money or you struggle to pay your bills having a good attitude and being postive will land you into a good job and also by meeting great people. Having a bad attitude can even ruin things that you know how to do well, if your suppose to be doing something and you do it with a bad attitude it wont turn out good, you will always end up doing something wrong because of your attitude.

252,2900,BBE9DDA6E3BD,"When I was in the fifth grader I went to the camp over summer the first day they made us do a project with a group to earn the title of the best group. The benefits of working in the group or working alone. Working in the group is more beneficial rather than working alone to work in the group is fun, makes me be more responsible and it is also the easier and creative way of finding solutions for the problem. First of all, working in the group is fun. For example, I have a friend who didnt like to work with anyone or even talk in his classroom,,, one day his teacher put him with group of students after working with them he finally made a new friends and the work that teacher was giving them was much more enjoyable with mates. For that reason I think this is a great way of learning, communicating and building friendship with people around us. Also group work makes us more responsible. I have friend his name is Generic_Name and I want to tell you something about him he is the most irresponsible student I have ever seen, but when it comes to a group work he is getting his job always done because he doesnt want his group lose the competition or simply fail the project. This made my vision clear that working with others makes people more responsible. Some say working with a group distracts them from the task, but I will disagree with them because I believe, that working in the group helps you find the creative way of solving the problems. In my computer science class we usually work with groups so there is this guy that thinks he knows more than some of us and for that reason he didnt work with us, so we solved the problem the way that no one in our class has solved the problem this way and the teacher gave us extra points for being the creative group of the class, and the smart guy that I mentioned before couldnt solve that problem. This is way I dont like to underestimate my teammates or classmates I know that together we can be smarter, faster, and even If the problem seems unsolvable together we can do it. In conclusion, working with a group is enjoyable, make you fulfill your obligations, and makes it easy for students to solve any kind of tasks.

When you do purchase it online sometimes they dont always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you cant tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy. People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games, TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person.

Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do.

Lots of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they dont start in a young age. In my opinion young students should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young students shouldnt start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family. My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age students can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young students gets lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, students get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kids have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take. My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, students can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they dont have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid wants to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, students knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the students a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, thats a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute. Some would argue that students shouldnt start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kids are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , its nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career. In conclusion, students should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world.

257,3189,529A633179FF,"Have you ever wondered about the importants and the difference between imagination and knowledge? Knowledge and imagination are both very important but I think knowledge is more important. Imagination is like thinking about something, or putting your self in that situation, while knowledge is an understanding gained by actual experience and it is also known as something learned and kept in your mind. Knowledge helps a lot of people to get jobs so everyone should try to get a knowledge so they can use it to help other people that dont have a very good knowledge. Majority of all the humans in the world get their knowledge from schools. They either get it from a public school which is made by the government or they get their knowledge from a private school which is made by and individual, or a group of people. Schools provide knowledge to students by putting them in classes with students that are their age. you need knowledge to give the students the information you learned, you cant be selfish with you knowledge because you must have been thought by some one, or you must have used someones resources to be intelligent. So if you a good education help other people that are not as smart as you because they can help you when you need it in life. If there was no knowledge in the world there will be no electronic devices that we can use, there will be no new inventions. We are gonna need more doctors to study and find out the cures to all the new diseases that is spreading around the world thats why we have schools and teachers to help. I think all knowledge should be free from first grade to the end of your college year. having to pay for college education makes a lot of students drop out and do drugs and they always get addicted to drugs and alcohol they even try to be you tubers or rappers which must of the time does not work. finally I disagree that imagination is more important than knowledge. So if you have a good knowledge you should be proud to share it with others. Imagination i also good for you but you should focus more on getting you knowledge so you can help others. helping others makes makes you feel much better about your self and it makes you day better.",6,7,8,7,6,7,1078,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

However, the use of technology had have negative effects on peoples lives. There are three reasons very clear about it. First, technology has a lot of wed-sites which attracted to most people. Therefore, when you walk in the park or wherever you go, you will see most people with their eyes into their phone, ipad, computers or another device. As a result, there are many road accidents or even some parents lose their children in the mall. Second, students are not productive in their classes. They do not need to read a book, to find the information what they need because everything is in the internet. In other words, technology is more intelligent than our students. Finally, technology has ended up with our social life. Nobody what to talk with other person without use his phone. In adittion, the comunication between parents and children, can not be possible these days because they are very busy surfing on internet. They spend a lot time in their devices, when they are in the store, in the house, in the work, even in a date. However, some people think that technology is not bad at all because it help to save people. For example, in a hospital, doctors usually use technology to do X-ray, operations and to test different body parts. This help them to do more professional their work. Also, it help to do many work outside the country. For example, if the government in our country want to send information to an allied country, it will be easier by e-mail. In conclusion, technology could cause death to people who do not know how use it. Also affects to the students learning and limited the human contact.

Fifty percent of all people go through depression, anxiety attacks and mental breakdowns because theres nobody there to help them, sometimes when you try to help they just either ignore you or they just dont want to be spoken too that means they havent been seeking help. A person who has a companion can be going through things too you know, but they express themselves to their best friend but for more help you can talk to your specialist doctor.

Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying. When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day. Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much youll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything youve been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because Ive been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home Id play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life. Some people dont like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts. In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that youll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal.

268,550,F93A5B7E57AF,"Being ourselves in a world strongly influenced,manipulated,and corrupted by people. Make a big difference in our lives .This also make us to know, who we are. Because we should not change our personality,our cultures,and how we were educated. Although being like other people make us to socialize easily. Nevertheless, we should not change our personalities. Because our personality is what help us to become our dreams in reality. For example there is a case of two guys who were twins one of them was nice all the time, and the other rude because he was influenced by his friends all the time having even a weird personality, that nobody liked. They attended to the same school their last year in high school, the one who was rude had many problems and one of those problems took him to death, however, his brother who was upset by his death, never stopped being a nice guy and having a great personality,he graduated from high school and attended to one of the best universities in the United States. Additonally having a real personality without any change help us to be more honest with ourselves. I remember last year in my math class my teacher told us to check our assigment by ourselves. In the honor system and I only got six of the ten questions right which was a sixty percent I told her the true and after she checked she gave points extra, she said that I deserved for being honest. In fact our personality gaves us an attitude and help us to be honest with ourselves. Another important reasons for which we should keep being ourselves is because we should not lose our culture. Because our culture makes us special and different to the rest. For example there is a story of a girl who moved from Colombia to Canada where she always practiced her culture even made a club with her traditions that colombian people in Canada visited,so she became famous really fast and made a lot of money. Additionally it is important to keep our culture in anywhere because the culture is an important legacy that children adapt from their parents. One amazing example of this is Leonel Messy a great soccer player, from Argentina, who has been living in Spain for a long time. However he is still practicing his culture and does not change his accent thanks to his family which made him to beloved by all Latin America. Therefore keeping practice our cultures will make our families, and others to be proud of us Also it is important to be ourselves, to show how we were educated. Due to our education is what define by itself how we threat other people. For example on the newspaper was written a story of a guy who teached a long time ago English to his students in a particular way giving them candies when they participated,he never changed his method and all his students got good scores always. Actually our education is most the most need in our life. For example my uncle graduated from high school and ten years after that. He attended to college and the university where he studied languages now he has a family an really good life,but he never stopped being the nice man he was and still being today. in conclusion,we must continue to be ourselves in anywhere, anytime to have a real and nice personality. That will open doors to become our dreams true. Also to keep our culture alive for the next generations. Making our families proud of ourselves. Finally it is important to be ourselves because it shows the way we were educated. Because a good education brings a good life. Therefore being ourselves bring so much good things to our life, that we should not change by the influence of other people.

Also you can contact them if some one far away from you is in the hospital or someone died in your family you can contact one of your family maembers to see what is happening at the house at that moment. Also You can play games on your phone or listen to music while you are going some where in the car or in the airplane. Also you can order food from your favourite restaurante to eat at home or at the hotel you are satying at.

270,2993,60623DB5DE7A,"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they wont be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc. A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they wont have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home. Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs. Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money. In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesnt have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesnt work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldnt be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off. In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.",9,7,8,8,8,9,1252,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and dont be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and dont concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that. When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and dont putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and dont have distractions all year.

If they are going to work they should of boughting less expanve shoes like $20-50 not more then that so we could do alot of differnt things. Some people need to know about that shouldnt buy high price stuff they have to buy less its better if they do not buy high price shoes because they can work and bein looking at there shoes everysingle time and saying dont get my shoes dirty. When teenage kids start work there like some I dont want to work but they should work becuse some teenger are like i want this no i this these expanve shoes. They are really exsenve stuff that alot of teenger want and like some just like to do differnt thing bought things they should not buy. Kids need to work so they now how much thing are because if are just asking and asking for stuff thats not going to work out wall there going to asking for really expance things that would not like. Everyone needs to know how much things are and work for it and not ask because that is how they are going to value something. If they buy it with there money they will know and how they need too take care of it and not buy high price stuff. They more that kids start working and not asking there parent it would be better because the kids would be done. I am working and i like to save my money because i can buy stuff that i need or anything but if someone buys me something i am going to value it becasue they took there time to come and bought something for me. like i did i bought my friend some pair of airpod and i bought my self some pair but when i gave it to him i said here is the pair of airpods that i got you for chrismas i wish you the best. It was better if bought him the pairs of airpods and not someone eles. He was so happy that i bought him a pair of airpods and i was his first girlfriend to and know that i am moving i told him and got sad .He told me i am very valued to him because i am all ways there for him and he is alllways there for me too. My vaule is my sister and my friend rj becasue of him i founf my true love. He makes me happy everyday i get to do alot of really differnt expernts and do fun things with him outside the school. He is the best I love him so much in all my heart because of him he has made me happy everyday no matter if i amsad or upset or anything.

275,1098,8C01B86DE888,"Homework Clubs Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills. First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didnt really do my homework and I knew that I didnt make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didnt like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded. Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done. Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didnt know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didnt need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didnt know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way. I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",9,7,8,7,7,9,1859,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Sometimes my friends dont like helping the community service because she doesnt care but i tell her its important to help the community because if we dont we just might not have water, food, etc. When my OTHER_NAME was here in LOCATION_NAME she sometimes take me to the park and pick up trash from the floor and throw it on the trash can or sometimes she takes me to go and check in the trash can to see if there is cans so we could recycle it. After when me and my OTHER_NAME was at the park picking up the trash we saw these two guys that were throwing food on the floor and I told my OTHER_NAME look those guys are throwing food on the floor so when they left I went and picked up what they threw on the floor cause its important to help the community service. Also sometimes I go to LOCATION_NAME and there is a lot of trash on the floor and when I always go over there with my cousin I always take a bag so i could pick up the trash and food that they have on the floor.

For example I have friends that do school at home and they are just like regular kids from High School, a lot of people would say that being home school its like going to prison but its not, home school just gives us a better way of learning at home with no one to bother. Another benefit of being home school is that you never have to worry about school shooters bad people in school, getting abues in school, not dealing with any problems with other students. Another benefit of being home school is that you dont have to wake up early in the morning to go to school, you dont have to miss the bus anymore, dont have to worry about sports, staying after school, basically you have freedom to do more stuff, a lot of people in high school dont have time to go out or have som fun, not many kids are able to go out becasues their parents are strict and dont let them out but thats besides the point, many kids take avantange of home school some of those kids, they have parents that travel around the world and they dont have a chance to sit down and talk about what is going on in school or the everyday life, their parents will take their kids with them becasue they dont want their kids to be home alone, instead they take the kids with thme so they dont have to miis out on their aventues, and a lot of these kids are very talented and ready for the out side world becasue their education was high quiality and always on point. They are good kids and bad kids that do home school, some of them coud have got in a ot of trouble and its not able to go back to school and some kids are home school because their patrenst have to work out of the country and they can be home by their selfs and they take thier kids with the.

278,2460,AF9F53EC3673,"Everyone has a talent or skill. In my case, Its music. Although my music skills are still improving, I would still consider it a talent or skill. Ive learned to play different instruments such as: the guitar, percussion, xylophone, and the violin, which is what im currently playing. At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade. Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade. I really felt passionate about the violin so I kept playing ,and still am ,and yet will continue until high school. My music skills can be useful at times, for example: my parents once asked me to play a song for their wedding, they thought it was marvelous. Last year, I sang a song ,that I composed, for my sisters birthday. She really enjoyed it. I like participating in music contests, concerts, etc. This year I went to New York for a violin concert, it was amazing.

279,51,9CE077EDCC85,The reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington quote . First this is a good quote for students who are always working hard and make a lot of mistakes because they get motivated from this quote. This quote can make someones day better . First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up. Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best. My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is its hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem. In conclusion I think that everyone should agree with Duke Ellingtons quote because it can help you not give up when you are going through a problem. ,6,6,7,6,6,6,2091,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

One reason that I think that is best to change the school lunch menu is that it could eliminate bad eating habits. Students can learn to eat without being tempted to eat junk food at school. Another reason on how you can switch the food is by substituting the schools junk food by exchanging it with something much more tasty and nutritious food that could lead into healthy eating routine to all the students. Some students say that they disagree on changing the school lunch menu. If were to eliminate students favorite school lunch meals; it could lead to them not to eat or buying junk food outside of school. However school lunch teachers are preparing tasty, and nutritious lunch ideas to serve to their students. Eating a nutritional diet could increase focus in class, increase lifespan, and minimize harmful toxins and bacteria to the body.

281,2484,36677FE57D6B,I disagree with the principal because. Students have homework and doing activities can get them stressed about school. Also some students have to take care of there siblings. Sometimes something important happens and your not home because your doing after school activities. Student have homework and doing after school activities. They dont have time to do home work and they an be failing a class. And failing a class can get you kicked out of the activity your in. And when your failing a classes you can get held back a grade and that will go in your record. Some students have to take of there siblings. Because there parents are working and there is no one home to take care of them. Maybe your baby brother is choking on a toy and your not home to save the baby . Maybe your parents went on a business trip and they will not come back for a week there is no time for after school activities you have to cook for them take them to the park. Maybe something important happened at you house and your not home. If your mom is a single mom and she has a medical condion and something happens to her.

282,2619,F4EA60BCBC2C,"Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group. When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster. Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily. In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas. Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster. In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

283,3798,01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like. Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they cant stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions. Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law. I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well. In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",6,8,6,8,7,6,18,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 6"
284,3505,9B15B90564A3,"I think that they should not do a homework club because what if students dont got time for that. A other reason would be is that many students dont do their homework nowdays so it was just be a waste time for the teachers unless they are getting paid extra for staying after school now thats a differnt story. A other reason is what if none of the students stayed after school the school would have to be sure if students would a tend this homework club. Students should be able to do thier homework on there own to be honest so that way they learn more cause maybe the teacher might be giving the students the answers and thats just not right! My other reason why they shouldnt do the homework club is what if most teachers dont give out homework like i dont get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldnt get homework. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club? How long would this homework club be a hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school.

285,472,3AFA78FFFC15,So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that wouldnt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people wouldnt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport. Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too. Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives shouldnt be lazy because that wouldnt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason. Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. wont have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time youll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play. Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life isnt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. ,5,4,6,4,5,6,764,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Lets to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills! What do to improved our talking/people skills, its important to get feedback from others and you dont even know when you need it of not. Like heres an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and doesnt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and its always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But its hard when you are nervous. How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why Im telling you this its because I dont want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more. Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future. Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that its important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think its better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion.

In my belief this is a good way to help kids not just with there homework but kids will improve on uderstading skills. they will learn how to learn things in a different way if they do not understand.

So my teacher suggested for me to join the homework club after school. At first I was not happy about it but then once I started to go I loved it because I understood math even better I kept geting in the upper 90 with test scores ,I had the most lessons done on a math program that is called Think trough math. I became a student helper at the homework club and I am now a smart intelligent math student. when I get to high school I will volunteer at the homework clubs at and go help kids for my own good and because I love to help people. These are all the reasons why I believe that having an after school homework club is important to students improvements. I will continue to volunteer in helping kids academically . Like we all know youth is the future of this world. I truly believe there are so many kids out there in the world that need help and they are smart but they can not get it because there is no one that pays attention to it. There will changes to that may be not in my life time but I will do what ever I can to get kids from around the world education and help where they can develop and be the best they can be.

First, to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future, all this is based on the future and what you are going be able to do, for example, if you do not do the four years in high school you will miss more information, that is going to affect you in the future, and sometimes you will not be able to select courses, or in some cases you will have to take these courses on summer, which is not a good idea, because most of the students with ages around sixteen and eighteen hang out a lot, so for the students is harder to focus on their thing as their courses, While the students that are doing four years of high school will have more time to focus on their courser, and they will have the oportunity to learn more. Second, the student that decided to graduated early are not goint to have the necessary knowlege, as the students that are doing the four years, for example, responsibility is one of the most important things, that you will use in the future, so how can you get it, for example, the homework, projects, and team work that you will have in high school, because doing four years in high school give you responsibility, and new abilities in the proces of learnig, also it develop your brain, and as consequences of learnig, and responsibility you will get new skills that you will be able to use in your work area, or college, while the students that graduated early are not going to be able not have the enough experience to enter a new system. Last, in my opinion the school that let student graduated one year early are not thinking in the welfare of the students, because they are not just letting the students go ealry, the schools had found a way that the student can rush themself to get out of the school soon, to go to college or work instead of doing the four years in high school, that will help a lot in the future. Because it is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school, the students will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student; to do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself for the future.

291,718,A570CD64F0F9,"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, ill be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something. First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends. Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it. It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jrs ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day? In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

293,815,F28D4ACF03AA,"I have multiple talents and skills, but my favorite one is skateboarding. Skateboarding is a very difficult skill it takes several hours, days maybe even years to accomplish and learn a trick on a skateboard, but thats why its such a unique sport and skill. Skateboarding has become a daily activity for me, it takes all my stress and problems away, thats why I enjoy it so much. I skate everywhere to the store, a friends house, and maybe even to school. although I get lots of injuries like scrapes, bruises and many more I still love this sport because skateboarding has taught me a lot like, being able to be confident when i try new things, getting right back up when I fall, and being able to learn from my mistakes. Skateboarding isnt just a sport, skill, activity or hobby its a way of life and even tho it may not be the safest sport ever its still one of my favorite skills that I think I wont get bored of any time soon. When I was nine I had lots of friends that would skateboard and I didnt know anything about skateboarding at the time so it was really cool being able to observe such a unique sport. I would always see them practicing and skating everywhere and that encouraged me one day to try it. So a couple days later I went up to my parents and told them that I wanted to try something new and it was skateboarding, my mom said she would think about it because she didnt want me to hurt my self, but my dad on the other hand told me to just go for it and thats exactly what I did. The next day after school I asked my mom if we could go to the nearest skate shop and she said yes. Once we got to the the skate shop I was looking around and i was so confused I saw decks wheels and so much more that i didnt even know about. So as I walked in the guy that was working there asked me ""is there something specific you are looking for"". I told him I was new to skateboarding and that ive never been on top of one, so he taught me what i needed to know about a skateboard like about the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. After that we got into assembling my first ever skateboard. Once I was done picking out all the stuff that was going to be on my skateboard we payed and he stared assembling it, once he finished we left the skate shop and it was to dark so I didnt get to skate that day sadly. The next day I get back home from school I put down my backpack and I imedietly went outside to try my new skateboard out the only thing i knew was to ride but i imedietly fell in love with skating. Since that day ive been skating every day and if its not every day its every other day. ",5,7,7,7,6,5,3591,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
294,274,43AE9E4D0EFC,"I would say that I am agree because If you want a succesful life you have to learn how to made your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not going to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that comming directtly to you. When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good and also you feel it, because when you are a goood person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that alot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aqualsbut ypu do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more succes, for example I am a good person with all people ,with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are specil I love them and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a succes person that make have a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a a nice life because I see in them that they will be very succes people. I think that have peace is a important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable,but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be incomfrotable but there is you have to try to have peace, I konw that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside of you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can make always and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that timeand I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good have that mind inside of me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is gonna be with me the my whole life, but I trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother and we are so close and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with with him I tell to him everything thatv is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul. A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people is nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn somethings from them and you can share some ideas, but in ypur life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days or they will invate you to have fun and you will think that those people are the good for your to be succes, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offert to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future , and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homeworks, he was a nice guy this happen in the sevent grade, but when we attend the nine grade he start to meet people that they had bad grades they di not do homeworks and I think they don not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends and then he turns to one of them , and I think he do not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future. I think we all agree after this three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is have a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.",6,5,6,7,5,6,880,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

A talent or skill that I have developed is being able to write in cursive. I develop and use this talent in many ways. In order to develop this talent and use this talent, firstly, I had to practice every single day, observe many other people write in cursive, and lastly I use it to sign many different items. One way I developed this skill is practicing. I used to spend everyday writing the whole entire alphabet in cursive to perfect how I wrote. I would meet up with my teacher after school everyday for about a month so that she could help me work on my writing. Another thing that I did was rewrite every document or letter that I saw or received to accomplish writing as good as the original writer. Another way I developed this skill is by observing other people. I would watch many ""How To"" YouTube videos to observe how other people wrote. I would observe how they wrote and I would write very similar to them. Whenever I saw anybody writing in cursive I would study their hand movements and match mine up to theirs to achieve writing perfectly. Any letters that I had received from family members I would examine to figure out how they wrote in such a perfect manner. One way I have used this skill is by signing my name on many different items. Anytime that I go to the doctors office I get asked to sign my name and knowing cursive comes in handy. Whenever I decide to write letters to my family I sign my name on the outside of the envelope so they know that its from me. Also, anything I have painted or drawn has my name signed on it.

Every country, every school, every teachers have teaching for students how to working together to playing games on assignment. And games can make for students likely work together to create atmosphere funny, if they working with a atmosphere new, they could be give some ideas faster and learning better. Why we need to teaching them the way like that? If we did not teaching the students working with a group, what happen will be? Almost the students really like working alone than working with a group. Because they think they can give some idea bad, and they dont want somebody complain when they do something wrong. If parents or teachers dont teaching them working with a group and believe by them self, they will never successful on the way they are.

Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost. Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they dont know where you fail when you writing essay.

In the ocean coral reefs are dyeing because of people and habitat distraction. some people think that coral reefs are just rocks growing out of other rocks but they are actually animals and they are living and breathing just like us. maybe they dont have noses like us they are animals and they should be treated like animals. in ten years we would have lost 100% of our coral reefs.

Sea life dies from plastic by getting stuck in it or eating since its not biodegradable.

Being active like career goals and helping others and being inactive can lead to alot of health proplems. Do people accomplish more if there pursuing their own interest, or just being inactive also accomplish goals also? Being inactive can lead to health benefits, and also your not helping yourself in life, also there is no purpose. If not being active can lead to an unsuccessful life. Just being inactive is bad in general but people do have opinions on about it. Some people like to stay inside, not get a job, dropout of school, and fisk of having a unhealty body. Being out of contact of the world is bad, and it very unhealthy to do that. Next is being active. It serves a purpose, and it benefits a lot in life like: maybe healthy body, pursing career goals, school goals, and helping others. Getting a job is good example of being active. Taking time out of the day to go accomplish anything that people are interested in is a good idea. People can pursue new learning skills in school or universities. Being active and getting goals accomplished is good in life. Having to participate in a activity will do good in life.

First impressions are the biggest factor in the world we live in right now, because we all want to have a good life, so we have to present our self properly.

308,3895,9DB8409B95F6,"It was a really nice day so we went to the park. We were going down the slide at the park, and I was with my brother, and sister. If I havent told you what their names are, Ill tell you right now! My brothers name is Generic_Name, and my sisters name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it. My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. He had a really cute little sister, and shes two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old. I asked Generic_Name what his brothers name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. When Generic_Name told me his brothers name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world. Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got to know each other, and now were best friends. Im so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. The saddest thing is that we dont go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers. We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow Its going to rain, and Its going to be really muddy, and wet outside. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didnt seem as happy, as we all did. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. So we went to the library. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Names ex girlfriend. I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, shes my best friend, and shes always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name arent true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address. Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because shes jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didnt feel the same way as Generic_Name did. Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. I really didnt expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. I dont trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, theyre not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Girls shouldnt change over a guy that doesnt feel the same way as you do, and boys shouldnt either! God has someone waiting for you! If you really trust someone, dont loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see whos being a bad friend to you, and whos being a good friend to you. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust. Theres always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but its okay. I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isnt even true, When someone lies to you, its hard for you to gain their trust. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying. Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that.

309,2821,1A469EB86263,"We can always accomplish if we have a time and also if we try to do more than do anything. Accomplish dont have to be all the time just when you can. For me to do accomplish more is better than dont do inactivity. I have 3 reason why I think do more accomplish. First reason is, to be better. Second reason is, do more. Third reason is, feelings. There are some reason why I think that be accomplish is better. For some of the people be accomplish is hard to the people because they dont have to much time. First reason is, be better is because your learn more, you have more experience. We dont wait our time if we do more job if we have to do more job we doing it. We dont have to be to lazy for do more job if we can do the job. Just if we dont have to much time that will be just to done the work. To do accomplish to spend more time doing it. Whatever thing is if we have time we doing it. I work every day if I have to do more work I do it but if I dont have a time do to my work I just done whatever I am doing. Second reason is do more. do more can be extra work done that will be nice ti have extra work done for the next day if we do the same we dont have to do more. Extra work have to be complete by the time and then dependently what do you do about. When people do extra work in their job the make more money and also they make more overtime hours in their job but no all the job are the same. For me to do more work is more easy for one think I learn more for, another think I just do extra job because I have time and I like too. To more is when we the people have time Third reason is feelings, why feelings? feelings is because when we do more work that have to be we are satisfy. In other way we feel like when you make a goal when you done. We have emotional feeling when we done the thing what we doing it and also when we accomplish more. After you finish doing the work we feel tired but is not the same when we are satisfy for done. when I do my extra work always measure that is good. When I know is good I say ""yes I finishing"" and I feel so proud of me. when we do something we have to be positive for every will be okay. In conclusion, to do accomplish will be the best idea for to better extra work. The reason why the accomplish is the idea is, to be better, to do more, and the last one is feeling. what Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we always doing"" that is most be true for all kind of people around the world. do more is always help and always do accomplish is the best idea.

310,1284,F84E5DEFC874,"Have you ever just sat down and thought, Do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some say sayings have a reason for example Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"", Does this mean it is true because he said it? Or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion? I strongly agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote, its saying in little words dont be lazy, its amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. If we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. I believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished. One reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. I have experienced this numerous of times at my job. At my job, we have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task dont get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we cant get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. We have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. When you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. For example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you cant make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. In my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case. Another reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you dont know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. This happens to me all the time where one day im just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden I start cleaning everything and organizing everything. Like Thomas Jefferson says ""Determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"" In this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished. Lastly I believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only 1 spot left. Obviously your going to need to practice everyday and know how to play. Practice makes perfect the more active you are with soccer, the more chances your gonna get that last spot to be a member of the soccer team, but say you really want the last spot but your just not as good as the others and its a new sport you just wanna try out but you are not practicing everyday to get better. If you dont practice everyday to get better then there are less chances of you making that last spot just because you werent as active and on it like the others. The more practice you receive the more chances you will have to get that last spot because of the dedication with no activity done theres no hope in that. In conclusion, inactive or active you get through your day and learn something new and that is a accomplishment so much can be done in many different situations, anything is possible. At one point through your day you accomplish making it through even if you felt like you didnt accomplish anything you must have, because you learn something new that is the biggest accomplishment. Thomas Jefferson said that for a reason for sure. Everything has a meaning and reason behind it. ",6,7,7,7,6,8,3722,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash cans when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i dont think another person would pick it up but they should. We dont want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem.

314,582,3BEF322748A1,"Imagine that you got a project in your college and in that project you have to interact with different people and you have to write about their lives, but now you will be thinking that it is really difficult project to do because in all those previous years of high school all you did was to avoid people. Some people believe that technology saves your time as you can buy or sell things online. However, so much use of technology effect your eyes and brain in a negative way. Therefore, usage of technology should be made less and people should interact with each other more, because the more friends you will have the less you will go in the depression. Use of technology have a lot of negative effects on peoples lives. Too much use of technology weakens your communication skills with other people. Recently it has been said that there are some kind of radiations on your phone and other electronics which affects your brain and body in a negative way. Too much use of phones, laptops and television can weak your eye sight making it difficult for you to see. Some people say that technology can be used for different kind of resources . On the other hand, it can also leads you towards the cyber crime which is really bad for you, because if you are caught once doing that crime the rest of your life you will be in jail. Now a days, if you will go outside, in many places you will see that there will be friends or family sitting on the same table but no one is talking with each other, everyone is on their devices. There are many people in todays world who do suicide or are in depression just because they think they have no one to whom they can talk and can share their problems. For example, if there is some one is trying to talk to you and is trying to be your friend but you are busy in using your phone and the next day you came to know that the person who was trying to talk with you yesterday did suicide today because that person thought that he had no one to whom he can talk. So you will blame yourself and you will regret at that time for not talking with that person. Hence, people should interact with each other more and more and they should try to know about each other life intead of using their devices all the time. People should spend more time with their families because not everything is found on Google,there are somethings which you learn by spending time with your family and your family will be the only one who will be with you every time, in your good and bad days, but your devices will not be with you and also they will not support you at that time.

315,1232,E0538F7AB083,"I agree with this statement, first impressions with people or places are difficult to changed. But first the definition of Impression is a lasting effect, opinion, or mental image. Is a belief of understanding of sth. Here is a example in a sentence, I made a bad impression by arriving late for the interview. I always see the bad and good things in each person and in each places too. But sometimes the impressions can change, It depends on the person. Now Im gonna make some examples about the first impressions in people and with places. For example, If Im going to a restaurant the first impressions that Im looking for, are If the local is cleanly(floor, chairs, etc..), the bathroom they arent dirty, the employers(making sure that they are using gloves when they touch the food and when they prepair the food, Plague(rats, cockroach, etc..) thats very important because we dont want to get transmit a bacteria or something like that). Another example, If Im going to a friend house, my first impressions that Im looking for, are typically the same of the restaurant, instead of the part of the employes(obviously), but if the house is dirty, for example: (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, etc...) that impressions can change for me, because they probably clean the house everyday, but just that day they dont clean it. And now Im gonna make some example of first impressions for a person, the first impression that I saw in a person is the personality(vibes, etc..), the education level(respectful, responsable, etc..), the way of she/he dress it(outfits) thats when the phrase ""dress to impress"" takes place, if the person is comic, etc.. Some person do the same, but some person just talk in the bad way of other persons, and sometimes they dont know them, they dont talk to them, and thats too bad impression for the person that is doing that, they are wrong :/ So my point, is I just said before, the impressions can change and it depends on the person.

316,1399,62B3C9C3398E,"Do we have to live other people experiences? If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isnt easy as we want but thats life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done its thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. Theres always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you dont follow his/her directions something could go wrong. Thats why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesnt mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor. People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I dont really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didnt have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasnt there to help him when he really needed him. If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and dont let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesnt matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but dont follow their directions. Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, dont let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but dont do want they want to do with your life. I know life isnt easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere. Dont follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and dont let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you dont know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you. Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you dont want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know.

I dont think that our character is formed by influences. Our character is what we make out of it. Some of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are, the way we treat people, and the way we tell ourselves to be. One of the reasons why I think we choose our own character is because of the way we are. The way we are tells people about ourselves a lot. It describes who we are. For example some people who know my sisters and I so well say that were all so different. Thats because we are all our own character. Some siblings look up one another so it makes them wanna be like their older sister so , they dont get to make their own character. Another reason is the way we treat people. The way we treat people is part of our character. It helps other people see the way you are. They judge you to see if youre nice or mean. Also what you hear about yourself makes you wanna act different. The last reason is the way you choose to be. You get to pick who you wanna be. Although some people say that your character is already formed by influences. They may have a point because they say that its how your family is. If your family taught you to be a certain way then you would grow up being that way because thats the way you grew up, but at the end of they day you are you. your family mightve taught you to be a certain way but you can always change how you wanna be.

At the end of the month Generic_Name get her results back and she passes all her exams. Likewise, the great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies no in setting out aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Some people prefer to aim low and achieve more, while other people prefer to achieve high and achieve more. The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive, have goals, and believe in themselves. The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive. In my life I hate staring new things, whenever I start something new I always think negative and I will not achieve it. At the end, I always achieve what I had started. When I started to think positive on what I am doing, I always end up happy for what I aimed for and achieved. People should be more positive on what theyre aiming for. When people start to think positive they will feel very sure and confident of what theyre aiming for. For this reason, people should not aim too low. Also, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should have a goal on what theyre aiming for. A psychology study have been done on people to test if goals work. The scientist that did the study explained why everyone should have goals, and how having a goal could lead to one do a lot of things. The scientist also explain that a goal is the purpose toward which effort is directed. Having goals to aim for something too high should lead one to achieve a lot of things. For this reason, people should have goals and aim high not low. Additionally, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should believe in themselves. In the TV show The Good Doctor, the main character Doctor Generic_Name had a surgery and there was only 20% chance that the patient will die. Generic_Name was a great doctor, but he didnt believe that he could do it. Until the patient was about to die, so Generic_Name had to do the surgery for the patient to live. The surgery went very well, and the patient went home healthy. The main character in this TV show didnt believe that he could do the surgery, and when he had to do the surgery it went well.

For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard its to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age. While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldnt be able to do any activies in school. Students shouldnt be allow to take classes at home while other students go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldnt be able to enjoy the life of a teenager. As a result, Do you think it will help students in the future?",7,6,6,7,6,6,1327,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

You gotta bring yourself up when feeling down. A negative attitude wont get you no where. I understand that sometime life problem can be difficult, but you gotta keep being positive. Dont let yourself get to a negstive stage beacuse you wont be anvoidable to accomplish your dream. In life being a negavtive person isnt a good solution if you to be success in life. A person with a negative mindset would have bed thought in their mind. For example"" you cant do this"" or "" just give up on life"" . you wont have enough confidence to accomlished your goal. If you are a negative person then you should get some help or go talk to someone help. So, you can become a better positive person. A positive attitude help you to be something in the future.

333,193,DCDED7261D03,"""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" everyone should be free of deciding their own character this is important because it can help with being more confident about yourself while making difficult choices, making clear what your goals for the future are, and makes easier to show who you really are to other individuals . In the other way some people believe that our character is formed by the difficulties and influences beyond our control. First, feeling confident about yourself is one of the best ways to succeed in life, it makes easier when deciding difficult choices, sometimes when people go through difficult moments in their lives, being confident with their self can help them choosing the best decision by just looking at the positive way of their decisions. For example, every time people visit a new locations they should feel confident with their selves while creating new friendships or business. Secondly, setting your goals is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to know what you really want, when people know what their goals are they have to work really hard and encourage their selves to achieve it. If people chose their own character its easier to set their goals because they really know who they are. For example, one of my goals is to graduate from high school. So,I need to put a lot of effort and hard working to achieve it. In the other way, some people claim that our character if formed by the influences beyond our control, some of those difficulties might be what your parents want or economic resources. Also, when people let others create their life choices or character they dont enjoy their life as how they want to enjoy it. Foe example, if your you let your parents decide what to do with your future, you might dont like that decision and that would not be really who you are. In addition, making your own character influence in how you show others who you truly are, this is important because, it feels better doing something that you chose and want than doing something that other individuals what you to do or difficult situations. In conclusion, I am agree with ""Johns"" quote because everyone should be able do decide what that really want to become, feeling confident with their selves, having clear all their goals and work hard to achieve them all, your character shouldnt be former by influences beyond their control. You should be able to show everyone who you really are.",8,7,7,7,7,8,3126,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

335,1271,E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success. First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldnt actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class. Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesnt actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution youre supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life. Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time youre losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal. In conclusion, some people said that failure doesnt lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success.

It is good for people who make their own decision, so that way they learn from their own mistakes, they need to learn how to get up whenever they feel in trouble. People who make their own decisions they know the consequences, but they know how to grow up as a person, and beat up any problem that they have. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for advices because older people seems to have more experience in some topics. First, people who made mistakes in life, they need to learn how to not made that mistake again. If someone is there just telling people what to do and what not to do, people will never learn how to not made that mistake again. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for some help, but they do not have to tell them exactly what do. If someone need help in something, they need to paid close attention, and see how is that person doing something. Due to the fact that many people made mistakes, they have to learn how to do decisions by themselves. Second, people who has been guided by their parents, but their parents are not with for them. Since their parents are not with them, and there is difficult time where some people will need the help of their parent, but because they was use to it, that their parents do everything for them, they will never know what to do. Because of that, people will never know how to get up and do everything by themselves.

339,2586,C1E9D98B3613,"I personally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson with his quote saying ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" The reason i agree is because I believe that you have to set your goals higher, if mastered something already. Its always alright to fail trying to master your goal because nobody is perfect. You also need to try different goals to master so youre good at several things. The first reason why i believe you should set your goal higher, if you have already mastered your goal is because if you keep doing the same thing youve done over and over and have already done great at it, you will not see any growth in you. For example if i was in a soccer team and played for a rec team. Which rec is when you sign up and get put on a team with no tryouts. If i played and score almost every game and always outplayed my opponents. I wouldnt grow as a soccer player because the opponents would be easy for me and wouldnt be a challenge so i would have to set my goal higher. For a higher goal i would have to move up to travel to see growth in me and have a challenge in the game. I believe that people also disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because they are scared to set there goal higher when they have already mastered it. The reason i think this is because they are embarrassed to fail and not do something right. When im reaching a goal of mine like getting three goals in the net in a soccer game. I work hard to try to accomplish my goal so i can master it and score three goals every single game. Sometimes i fail and dont score three goals but i always tell my self its alright because when youre reaching a goal you will fail at least once or probably more then once. Which makes me work harder. Nobody is perfect and always a good thing to fail to learn about your mistakes. The last reason why i agree is because you have to try to master different things in life. Sticking with the same thing you mastered will just not make you good at anything else. Its always great to have different things youre good at because you can do a lot of other things. If you dont like any of the goals you want to master and cant reach it. Its always great to have other ones along the other one youre trying to reach because i know a lot of people change their thoughts and want to do more then one goal at a time. You have to set your goals higher if mastered something so you can see growth in yourself. When setting your goals higher you will fail at least once, you shouldnt worry because it makes you learn about your mistakes and so you wont do what you did to make you fail. Also you have to try different things to master to be good at several things in life. This is why i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote he wrote.

I think that If you have a positive attitude you wont get in trouble because the attitude that you give out is the way that people judge you, A positive attitude is a great way to get the things you want in life like for example, If you want to get a job or a career you have to have a good and positive attitude because if not then they will not accept you like for another example if you have a positive attitude you can make friends and people will like you because of the way you are if your kind people will be like ""wow this person is so nice and kind"" i just think that being kind and nice is the best way to be in life you dont really get in trouble because your attitudes nice and not rude and about things that people tell you or want you to do in the other hand if your rude and people people will look and you and think about you in a rude way and not like you. The reasons I feel like a positive attitude is good because i am a kind person and dont get in to trouble with none because there is no reason to be mad and angry about small stuff. I fell like other people might think different about what I think because we all think different about everything. If you go to a friends house and you be all mean and rude and all dirty people are not going to like you because of the way you are and the other hand if you are all nice people they will like you because of how you are you and that you have respect of how your attitude is if not then you will not be wanted by people because of you act and are and people who act all rude end up in places they never thought they would end up in i just saying just stay with a positive attitude in the world and you will succeed in life and be great and not have to go through stuff like get in to fights or locked up in jail. I meant i know some people that have bad attitude and life and they are doing great in life but there is going to be one day that you will get in a problem by the way you act i think that just stay with a positive attitude so you dont got to worry about anythings and that its just better way to get al the things you need and would like to active in life because why be all rude when you can just be sweet and caring then be all grumpy and mad about small little things that can be fixed because thats what I think but if you have a bad attitude you might like end up saying or doing something that you will regret like if your like taking and with a attitude you might end up saying stuff that you dont mean and if your normal and calm about stuff you dont go to worry about nothing.

(people who believe and value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas). 1-the school is one good example for this is because the school give you exams and work for do on your own self, - the school give you a lot of challenge one of them are the tests, for get good grates on those test you have to self-reliance to study and pass those test. 2-the work (jobs) is other best examples,they give you the opportunity to show them that you are a excellent employee and that you can create your own ideas. -the work is other place to explain the self-reliance, your boss is asking you if you can do a work for him and that work is important for him because he ask to other workers but they copy the work from other company so he belief that you can do the things better that other and you have to self-reliance for that work and create your own ideas for it. 3- on my own life, the idea to choose what we have to do on the future is because our parent want that us get the best opportunities but sometimes we dont want to do the things that our parent tell us because we want to do the best thing for be the best but not like they want we want to do the thing on my own way. conclusion i believe that, we always have to self reliance because, that help you doing things that you never imagine that you could do that, and never keep focus in just one thing, put your mind open for make better decisions and follow your instincts for do the best that you can, my conclusion is that you always have to believe in your self-reliance and always follow your dreams for more hard that those things can be but that is the opportunity for your self-reliance and show that you can do the things that you want if you bring your ideas and follow your dreams.",7,6,5,5,6,6,365,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

346,1281,349FF2E7D179,"Although, setting a good example by your behavior is helpful to others, there are other ways to set a good example. Talking to people and persuading them to do good is influential, you can save someones life by talking to them, you can help someone be successful by talking to them and influencing them to do good helping them take the right path to becoming successful, seeing someone fail knowing you couldve spoke to them and influenced them on the right path would suck; I personally would feel horrible, sometimes all it takes is a couple words to influence someone. People dont always pay attention to your actions, people pay attention when their spoken to, when you talk to someone one on one its so much easier to get their attention rather than you behaving good in class for example. Actions can determine the way you change someones decisions, the way you behave can set a good example to other people but ask yourself would you rather have someone talk to you or you go off based on how someone else behaves? Confidence in yourself is also a good way to influence people, you need to be confident in what youre going to say to the other person, you need to be assured of what youre going to say to them. In order for you to be confident you need to genuinely know that person in order to find ways to influence them. Once you talk to them and get to know them better you can go ahead and influence someone, it isnt always how you behave there are plenty of ways you can influence someone. Confidence in yourself is important because once youre confident everything will go smoothly, find out what the person likes and dislikes once you have that in hand youre good to go. Honesty plays a big part when it comes to influencing someone, why? When you speak with honesty you wont hesitate in what youre talking about, you wont feel guilty of lying because youre speaking the truth. Respect is also something you should when influencing someone, when you show someone respect the connection of the dialogue increases and the other person will be interested in talking to you. Determination into influencing someone is probably the most important thing, when youre determined into doing something its because you really want to do it, nothing is stopping you from doing what youre determined to do. When youre determined into influencing someone you feel secure in what youre doing, thats when confidence kicks in determination and confidence are somewhat alike, determination is when youve decided to do something and theres no turning back, once you feel determined influencing someone will be easy, especially if you know the person well. Decision making on yourself is important too, you cant go off influencing people to do wrong you need to do a self check and ask yourself if youre ready to influence people, you have to ask yourself do my actions match what I say, when influencing someone you want to influence them to do good not bad. Preparation, you have to prepare yourself before going off to influence other people, why? Because you cant go off influencing people if youre not prepared to do so, do research on how to positively influence people, practice it with friends and family. Influencing people isnt easy, it takes a lot of practice, determination, confidence, respect and just getting to know the person well, once you have all those qualities youre able to go off and influence people that need help, people that need someone to talk them through, there are people out there that rather have someone talk to them and influence them on the right path rather than watching how other people behave. Behavior isnt the only thing the only thing you can do to influence someone, to influence someone you need to be prepared, you need to have confidence in yourself before going and trying to convince people to do things how you tell them to because sometimes we feel like were right but we never take the time and think if were wrong or go back and see what you can improve in. Make sure youre on the right path so you can ahead and help someone else take the right path with you. Go ahead and influence someone just remember that your behavior isnt the only thing that people look at, people look at your qualities and how you approach them, make sure you do everything correctly and youll be set.

Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option its by attending normal classes. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. We can have many benefits by this. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers. Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. She chose to do classes at home. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Her mom told her that if she werent pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she werent to feel that way. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends. Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. While distance learning dont have activities or clubs for students to do. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football. They might like to form part of the football team and thats what normal schools provides. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities. Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. Its a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we dont. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or its really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation. At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. School its a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning dont offer.

350,67,CB327222A71B,"I agree with the Author Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a word that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", because the most important in this world is to be yourself. To be yourself is to make you unique and different for the others. Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let others people tell you to be different. The first is to be yourself. Some people things if you dont be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. In my case when I came in the United States, I dont like to be myself because I was a little scared the kind of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people."" In that moment I changed my life and the way I look people. The second things is to achieve goals by yourself is motivate you to continue do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself dont only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you think, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth. The third things what is important is dont let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they dont like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I dont remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Dont let any person to over shine the light you had."" In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself dont matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let other people tell you to be different.

Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone.""

He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had. As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different systems programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will. In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school.

353,1479,4906FE42D823,"Philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" meaning setting a good example by your own behavior to influence other people. Some say setting a good example is the best way for one to influence others, on the other hand, there are better ways to influence others. The best ways to influence other is to show motivation and to be positive in what is being accomplished. Motivation is a major aspect to those trying to reach or accomplish a certain goal. For example, a person is trying to lose weight and be in better shape to do or a sport in school, but that person isnt feeling motivated to do anything, with even a little motivation by saying ""its going to be tough at the start, but once you feel like giving up ask yourself why you started"" can get that person moving and determined to reach the goal thats being aimed for. Not only is Motivation a huge impact in influencing other, Being positive is a major key to get others moving. Being positive can affect others in a way to get them more influenced. For example, a person is trying to write a song but just cant seem to figure out what or how to write it, stress and anger is taking over but showing the positive can allow that person to relax and have a clear mind on knowing what to write about. Being positive can easily affect those that are around and by saying, thinking, and listening to positive things is can influence so many others. There are millions of other ways to influence people, and it most certainly is the best way to do so. Motivation and being positive can indeed help those who need the influence, even when they cant reach their goal or cant be able to write a certain song, these following reasons have showed how it can help and many more can be done to influence others.",5,6,7,7,6,6,955,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Having a good attitude will take you places were people could never think of and will help up be successful in like get a good job, get promoted,then get to the top and make lots of money. I know a lot of people want to be rich and make lots of money so got good attitude in life some dont. everyone have their own ideas and have their own perspective of each other. Lots of people are negative in the world most people have it the hard way became the are poor dont have anything more to live for but that is wrong people you need to keep your head up no matter what happens. After that, I think that I also said that being kind to people and giving them a smile will cheer a lot of people up, and make the world a better place and make everyone be grateful for what they have. People dont want to be by themselves they want to be with other humans and wants a better for everyone. In all honestly people should work for a better work space and have a good attitude. Having a good attitude is extremely good for work place and more. I think that people need to know whats bests for them and there heath. I also imagine lots of people with good attitude but there are a lot of people with bad attitudes. ",6,6,7,7,6,7,1189,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
357,3796,FCC2991C1760,"Kahoot is one of the best educational activitys for teachers to use in school and for kids to learn with. Because when ever kids are using kahoot they work together to get the right answers,kids enjoy using kahoot to learn better then using paper and books because kids get really bored of using paper and books,Paper and books are also boring for teachers to grade too. But , Kahoot keeps the kids more active when they are learning and gives the teacher better controll of the kids. Also,kahoot is easy to teach with because when kids use paper and books the teacher has to go to the kids one by one just to correct their mistakes but when the teachers are using kahoot they can explain the right answer faster and better in front of the whole class. Teachers who use papers and books are always tried because they have to grade them, one by one and cant go home untill their done and teachers somtimes get really lazy. But, when teachers are using kahoot to teach it easy to see who did it and who did not do it and they do not get so tried and when the teachers are not tried they can teach better . And when kids use kahoot they talk to each other and when kids talk to each other and work together they do a great job and nobody is left out or bullied. Pearents will be able to help their kids learn more at home too and the more they use it the smarter they get. so that why kahoot should be used in school and home .

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff. The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aims low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

365,3288,DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect students learning in the process. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on whats being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper. In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students.

Also because students have no reason to be texting in class if other students they are texting are in class too, students shouldnt be allowed to have phones in school because they would be distracting the rest of the class when their phone goes off in class. If students can have phones in school its a sure fact that theyre going to be using them in class. With Policy 2 the school can take the phones away at the beginning of the school day to be sure they arent using the phone during class. Also with Policy 2 the students arent able to be communicating just in case they have a test. If the phones are taken away they will reduce the chances of the students cheating on tests. I also pick Policy 2 because students are going to be distracting the class if someone sent them a message and the phone goes of in class in the middle of a lesson. No one likes to be distracted while they are learning, or at least i know i dont. Thats why there shouldnt be phones in schools.

For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time. Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already. Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime dont get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about. You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, its give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because shes working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do. In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, its the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

375,1068,72095D288A5B,Establishing a homework club would be a great idea because students can get help. Another reason this is useful to student is because they could finish all her/his work and get more time to do what they want at home. Lastly It gives them an chance to learn more. Students can get help in a homework club easily. One way they can get help is by asking a teacher for help. Another way a student can get help is asking a friend for help. They can get help with a teacher and a friend. This is how students can get help easily. Students can finish there work at school. When they finish there work at school they got more time to do whatever they want. They could play games. They could read a book. they could take frequent naps. In conclusion people can do more things when there done with there work. This gives them a chance to learn more because they can ask more questions and get there work done. In conclusion they should establish a homework club for the people that need help. Also for the people that want to finish there homework. Thats why they should establish homework club,7,7,7,6,8,8,1476,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
376,1192,44D6EEDAE5BD,"Most people will just act all childish just because they are having a bad day without even thinking that it can ruin their future. Bad impressions usually lead to failure, it can ruin opportunities, and people can also get themselves mistaken. I agree that someones first impressions are almost impossible to change because it can affect their future. Firstly to begin with, first impressions usually lead to failure in life when they are bad impressions. People need to learn how to act politely even if they are full of sorrow inside without showing it. When people make bad impressions about themselves, it always makes it harder for other people to see who that person really is. Loosing big opportunities always lead to a challenging future. Secondly another, bad impressions always ruin many opportunities for people, especially young people. It is an every day thing in the United States. People can loose job opportunities and it makes it harder for them to get a second chance. Second chances are really big deal, no one can live without them. If someone did some awful things and did not get another chance, then that person just lost an opportunity of a lifetime and is going to regret it for the rest of his or her life. Also, people get themselves mistaken all the time because of that. Other people will never see that person for who he or she really is when that person is acting in an unusual way which is not normal. They will look at that person as he introduced himself as. They would not want nothing to do with him. They would also think that he is mean even if he is just having a bad day. In conclusion, no one should let problems make them show a bad impression about themselves. Everyone has problems. They just need to learn how to control themselves and not make any scenes about it to embarrass themselves. They should know that the consequences are real and they are not games. People need to grow up, be responsible, act fairly, and be happy. ",7,9,7,7,7,7,895,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 9, cohesion 7"

378,606,CEFDC545C24F,"Should high schools extend the school day two hours. This is important because students need time to learn the maternal. I think students will get a better benefit from two hours more. My first reason is students will have a better education learning. My second reason is students wouldnt have to stay after school hours to get get help, while they have extra time in class to ask any questions. Students will have a much better understanding on the subject. The high schooners would get to learn the maternal more, spend more time on the subject. They would ask more questions on the topic. Students wouldnt fail if they spent more time to learn it. They would have more practice and more additives to do in class. Because some teacher teach it way to fast because of the sols they have to finish all of the units before sols. We have to be prepared for the sols but we have to take time on it learn it. Students will have time to learn everything, therefor they wouldnt have to stay after school. Students wouldnt have to waste teachers time after school to caught up what they messed from class. Teachers have to come home to there families too. Most teenagers have jobs so some of them cant stay after school. Some students dont have rides after school. They would have a three day weekend. Only go to school four days of the week. Have time to study on the weekends. This is why high school should extend two hours more of school. They will have a better understanding. They need time to learn the maternal in time for the sols. The highers schools will have a better knowledge.

379,3747,34D76C62269C,"If you still attended school, how would it feel to go to school the whole year? Just have off 3-4 weeks of summer break, maybe 2 weeks of winter break and 1 week in fall and spring break. Well I can imagine that and just imagining that makes my head hurt. Just having to come for 8-9 months of school is hard for some students and I would think that less number of students would come to school if we had a year-round school. Just having a normal school year(8-9 months)is amazing. Although some people say that having a year-round school is a amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year, actually having a year-round school is not a great idea because students would have less stress about school and also students would try harder when they come back from summer break. Although some people say that having a year-round school is an amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year. Also because students would come back after 3-4 weeks and still remember. Having a year-round school would give students more time to learn all the material they have to know and more easy and faster. also have more opportunity to get better grades because you are more time in school. I read in a article that it said that the more time you spend in school and focus the better it is for you in the future. Having a year-round school has advantages and disadvantages such as being more time in school,less time being out of school, maybe less school activities, less summer time , etc. Many things can change when the school changes. is always better to keep the old way than start a new way and not be successful. I think that not having a year-round school is a good idea because students would have less stress about school. Students wont be as stress because of school the whole year and only a little bit of vacation. Stress can be something bad not just for students but for everyone. Stress causes illness such as your head hurts,back hurts, feel like not doing anything, etc. Not having a system of school like that can give students more time for vacation alone or with the family. Having a 3-4 moths of summer vacation is enough for you to have a really nice vacation with family or like I said before alone. school causes a lot stress for students and having to come all year is more stressful. enjoying your summer is not just about one week or two is about having time for yourself and family. also not having a year-round school would make students try more for the next year that they come back to school. When students have more time off school it makes them want to come back. Students want to come back and start the year. Some of them get so tired of being at home that they just want to come back. Also being on regular school break students enjoy more the summer than just 1 month or less. They have more opportunity to go explore the world and everything. Much more freedom for the summer. When is summer students cant wait to leave school but when its like 2 months out of school they want to come back. Summer is the best season for a student because is when they enjoy most of there time with the family,friends and having fun in the summer is the best memories and maybe the best memories they have with friends and family. My best memories are the ones in summer that I enjoy mostly with my family. In conclusion, some people say that having a year-round school is great because that way students wont forget what they had learned over the year but I think that having a year-around is not a good idea because students would feel more fatigue than the usual and also when they come back to school they would feel more comfortable and ready to learn more again. Being out of school is a great thing but when you are almost done with summer you just want to go back to school and see your friends and than is the same thing when you are going to summer you feel so excited that you just want to be done and not come back but is the same feeling when you are coming back from summer to start the year. Having pretty experiences and sharing time with the family is amazing that is what makes summer amazing. wouldnt you want to have your children with you in summer vacation?

382,3047,085C8B43ADD6,"Some students would be more excited about having a longer summer vacation, it can give the students a longer time to spend with their families and friends, but if we think in a positive side it also means that having a longer break i could be most likely be a reward for those who has been studying hard throughout the whole entire year that deserves to get a vacation or a break of getting away from everything that has them stressing out over paper or either having to worry about their grades, which is good for students to knows how serious and important their education is so, they can success in the future all full of opportunities knowing what do to when it comes to face their problems alone base on what they have learn. For example in this Prompt educators thinks that students do not seem to retain what they have learn during the year when they are coming back to school after their break, they seem not know about anything or forget about stuff, which is true people to not appear to be thinking about things that might stress them out, instead they try to have fun with their love ones, and of course try to read some books every other day or read the news papers so you wont be left behind on what is actually going on in the world, perhaps we might forgot about stuff younger people are faster learners and thinkers, can not be able to forget about important information that easy. Most of the students usually travels a lot during summer vacation out of the state or they like to visit different countries, so yes basically what im trying to say is that a longer break or summer vacation is a good idea for those in specific who travels far away so it can give them enough time to explore wherever they going to be staying, and this can even be helpful for students to learn about different history, experiences, explore and this are some stuff that they can even share with their friends in school or with their teachers, that it can improve more their knowledge. Being away from school just for at least one month it can really effect anyone, I think that this could be effecting on just depending on how distracted you will be during the break, some students cant even call it a ""break"" or ""vacation"" because some of them would rather to take this time to earn a little bit of money to be able to effort for their needs and expenses, or they might have responsibilities to take care of,Others likes to volunteer in community services or try to be involve in different activities that will keep you busy. In respond to everything i do think that having a longer summer vacation would be good enough to catch up as much as we can with our old friends and families maybe when we were in school we wast able to see them enough because some of our love ones live far away from us so we take our time to spend every little moment we have lost while we were way and it benefits everyone in general, not just for students.

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community.

384,146,7BC73C8FBDBC,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated. Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they dont want to work. some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school. Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it wont have distractions that a online has. However, Students wont lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school. Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers wont helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didnt know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time. In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they wont be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools.

385,2886,AB86BAABBF68,"Its a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass. For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking. If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate. and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate. For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate. Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in. I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade, So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining. One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades. So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do. It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class. The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",7,8,6,8,6,6,2298,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

I can say from my own experiences. Somethings just come to you and your able to keep being good at it. While there are also things that are not able to do on the first try or ever. For instance my seventh grade year I was trying out for football. I had never played a game or ever tried out. First try and boom I am on the football team. I played left tackle and was a starter for ""A-team"". I had never played before and I was already starting. I didnt fail to succeed, I just succeeded. As a result from the facts I have stated. I do not believe or agree in ""failing comes success"". Failing happens to everyone and I have yet to hear someone say "" I failed to succeed"". It is very uncommon for someone. If it has not happened to me in all of my seventeen soon to be eighteen years of life i dont believe it is possible.

388,961,E83134C87EFA,"Lets be honest when a stranger smiles at you it makes your day 10 times better. Many people believes that if you have positive attitude in life you will success in life. I think that positive attitude is the key to be successful in life because if you show positive attitude to someone it will make your day better and theirs too, when you show negative attitude about something you always fail, and having negative attitude can also effect your mental health. Although showing positive attitude can not solve someones problems, but it sure makes their day better, But if you show negative attitude to someone it will make their day worse. Having positive attitude can give you a lots of opportunity in life. and having positive attitude can also prevents you from failing in life. Many people fail in life because they always show negative attitude, for example if you show positive attitude at work you will have coworkers and boss who appreciate your positive attitude. You will be successful because you are not worry, or stress about it. But if your show negative attitude about it you will lose the job and fail which can cause depression. Having negative attitude in life not only make you fail in life, but also make you not try it again because you are too scared to fail again which can be very effective one your mental health. although being positive does not solve all of your problems, but it will help your mental health. Some teens in high school are always worried, depressed, and desperate because they always show negative attitude to teachers and their friends. Which effects their mental health. Having negative attitude can prevent you from having friends and it can also prevents you from having good teachers who help you in test. Which can cause you fail the class and not graduate high school. Which will impact on your health. Overall, positive attitude is the key to be successful in life because it gives you a lots of opportunity in life. Which can make you successful in life. Having positive attitude can also cause you have coworkers and boss who appreciate your positive attitude. And although being positive does not solve all of your problems, but it will help your mental health. ",6,6,7,8,6,7,3361,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
389,2813,6D06DAD5446C,"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesnt have any saying in your life, if you dont want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right. The first reason is that its okay if you dont want the other persons help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didnt want any, because she dont want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still dont want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me. The second reason is people dont have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesnt want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and thats good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us. Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example Im 18 years ago, and im still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but im scared at no matter what im still feeling down with stuff. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. And im happy, so yeah thats good for me. So basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERES ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU. So its good to get some advice and wisdom from others. even though you dont want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.",8,8,7,6,6,7,1423,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
390,2902,1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. Thats why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards. Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. Thats how students cant continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class. Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they dont have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesnt matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher. How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people dont have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they dont have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they dont need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, its not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that Im better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL. Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, its when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldnt be able to continue without being praised. Some people do not survive when they dont get to achieved, then they complain on someone who dont give presents. Self-esteems always comes from achievements never comes from praising.

391,2400,5D2B8506EC4F,"I agree with the statement because the first impression that we make cant be change complete even the try to change. First impression is something no one can forget it can be attitude, love, feel but with all this impression we can not forget or change even we went to it will not be the same to impress someone with an ex we are attitude they ways we talk, walk even eat no one can change and someone try to impress his love to a girl he has be in love since children even someone come out of no where he will not be able to change the first impression of this person. When we make the first impression to people even we know they will try to copied or change it will be impossible because everyone know the impression it is not something that we can change even we change it is not going be the same an example Generic_Name tried to impression Generic_Name with her food Generic_Name love it and went to make the same food it will be the same but it will not taste the same way because he dont known what kind of ingredient she put in and even she tell him it will not going taste the same so every first impression can not be change. We known what it is a first impression are almost impossible to change because it kind like feeling no one can change because impression is something we do to impress people with what we have sometime is not even real or fake but some time we think it real, Generic_Name lied about her personality and family to try to impression hers friends in school they will believe her so impression can be sometime a lie but impossible to change. We need to understand that first impression it something that it impossible to change and we need to believe to our self and not try to change other people first impression or copied them it will be painful to retry even to we known but it will not going to be the same.

392,2965,5923F6631724," Why do we have to go school for eight and a half hours for five days per week? We cant do anything after school! Please imagine that situation. If that situation became for real, how are students going to react to it? Of course, they are going to be mad, and they might have more stress. Therefore, although some people agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because students can have time for studying, and it is very educational for them, I disagree with that idea because it interferes their family time and after school activities, and it is going to become cause of they have more stress. First of all, students cant have time for family and other activities. At recent, many kids hang out with their friends than families especially teenagers. I think students should have more family time to having great relationship with thier families. Additionally, some students have activities after school. Activity is an essential way to relax and have fun, and it also helps students find new hobbies and make new friends. As a result, if adding one and a half houres to school, it steals a lot of wonderful opportunities from students. Second, it gives more stress to students. Some students have large amount of stress already. During the school week, they study for about seven hours per day, and sometimes they need to work on project and study for quizes and tests. Also, they have homework at least one subject everyday. Thats why students have a lot of stress. To decrease their stress, school needs to give a time to relax for them after school. In conclusion, adding more time to school has many disadvantages for students. Students need family time and time to work on their activities after school to have fun and relax. School is not a place that give a stress to them. School is a place that give a opportunity to get interesting knowledges to them. I believe school should overrule this idea if you think about students.",8,7,7,6,5,7,1154,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
393,1090,9ED1E2DB0B0F,"If someone wants to grow more as a person, they will have to try different things. I believe that Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future. an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia. Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person. I also like to thing that Im a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. Im a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that Im having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student . People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his lifes. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his lifes. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered. people have to do different things in their lifes if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they dont have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person.

Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions. If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone. When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment. When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses. Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more.

This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure. I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed. This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didnt like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that im talking about didnt like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too.

402,3326,F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements. True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and its the cause of someones self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month. Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that cant start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they dont feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how theyre feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they dont want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who cant learn if she doesnt feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesnt feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning. Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If youre being praised for something good youve done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals. In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement.",7,7,6,6,8,8,3708,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
403,2928,EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because theyll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready. Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high schools dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school. Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have. Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others. This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

But like John Lubbock says "" your character will be what yourself choose to make it"". I agree with John Lubbock because is important that you have to choose what will be your character traits and this are my reason. Firts reason is you create your own personality. The second reason is the you are not monotonous. And the last reason having others people respect. When we create our own personality is means in a group of friend we are the funny, the serious, or the person the never pay attention what the other friend is saying ( that is me I never pay attention what my friends is seaying). Have your own personality is important because that is what make you unique when dont permit the other people influeneces with idea. When a person is monotonous is they dont a different way to do the work they always is going to do the same every single thing for example in art class the teacher make a painting of a sundown and then they have to the same painting all the student is gonna put their own style to the same painting but this student is make a replica of the teacher work he dont put a different style or a different color. Some people may says that be differentof the other people is no important. However having your own personality is very important and that is my tird reason, having your own personality can get other people respect and some is gonna says the why you are talking about. Well get respect from the others people with your personality can be healthfull because when you are good leader the workers respect you and they work more and if you still confesed well let me ask you if you work with boss the is always angry and he is always yell you will be confortable to work ( I dont belive) or your boss is always making jokes you know to be ""cool"" you will respect him (I dont believe).

406,3876,583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isnt a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up. People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early youd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because theyre studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments. I think its better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if youre apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time. Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits. In conclusion i think its best if people dont graduate early because theyd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe its better and easier to graduate after the four years.

It up to them to chose if they want to go to college or go straight into the work and start making money to help themselves. but I suggest graduating high school in four years is a good idea because students want to spend some time with their families before going into college if they chose or go straight into the working force.

Now you dont think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression. First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice.

414,1152,7203112033A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldnt be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents cant drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe youll like it. 1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school Ive never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobodys crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and itll be a good switch for you too! 2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isnt, but say one day you move and u cant find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents cant take you cause theyre running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well thats why youve been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldnt have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldnt ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you. 3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it youll love it. In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits youve never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life.

I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take. One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time, which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition. But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best. Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and dont do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school. it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

417,3160,3F3DC123EDF6,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives? Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves. First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff. Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents. Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age.

419,631,602E786321EA,"Others may think otherwise, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Take Elon Musk for an example, he started out as a young kid who learned how to use computers but he did not stop there. Once he mastered computers he set higher and higher goals to master untill he ended up to be one of the richest man alive. I myself started with just drawing and graphic designing little art projects. then I started putting higher goals to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobes products and doing commisions. Leonardo DaVinci was not just an artist. He was an inventer. he invented numerous of things, he had multiple skills. thats because he mastered all of these skills he set higher goals for himself and he achived them. First examaple Elon musk. He was a bright kid. He leared how to use computers at a young age and mastered how to use them. Elon Musk did not stop there, He set higher goals to master. Elon Musk Drasticly Grew alot over the years. For and example he invented PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla. Now he is one of the riches man alive. Second example is myself. I started out with just Drawing and graphic Designing a simple banner for my YouTube channel. then I started setting higher goals for myself to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobes products. Doing commisions for YouTubers and Esports teams and making money. Last example is Leonardo DaVinci, Leoanrdo DaVinci was no ordinary artist from the Renissance Age. What made Leonardo DaVinci Stand out was that he was not a quitter infact he loved setting higher goals for himself to master. He loved growing, learning and mastering new things. Leoanrdo was not only an artist he was an inventor a scientist and that why he grew up to be one of many people biggest inspiration infact he is my inspiration. Leoanrdo was not a quiter and thats what made him grow up to be special and successful if life. Now other may say that you dont need set higher goals to grow. But I think quite the opposite becuase if you dont set higher goals for yourself then learning new things and growing new skills would most likely be impossible unless you try to surpass your last achivement therfore you wont be able to grow and be as successful in life.

For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you cant go outside cause its to dark and your parents wont let you cause of hours of school.

424,1107,200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what were doing benefits us. Why? Because if were always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isnt benefiting your future then theres no point of doing something that doesnt help you out for later on in life. For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if youre great at playing the sport. And also its another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example. Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then thats another great thing to do thatll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active its going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you wont have that many health problems or issues with your body so youll always stay fit. Whatll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so thats something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future. Also working is something you could always do thatll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means youll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. Itll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you wont just be home doing anything. So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I dont believe inactivity serves a purpose because you wont accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you wont be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future.

In daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. People stress things out and they dont know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work.

First of all,school prepares students to face up and go against the real world,some students may need at least one more year in school to get their mind set for their future. Staying the extra year can make the student focus more on the classes that theyre taking. If students decide to only go for three years, they can forget about sports or any after school activities they want be in. They will have to put all their effort and energy into passing their after school classes. Second of all,students can be more independent. Students learn how to manage time to do work and extra activities. Students can also learn how to be more reliable and build up their confidence on doing things on task and on time. By doing the three year only, they cant take breaks and if so the students wont have enough time to rest their bodies and be able to do what is asked.

When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments.

But this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents dont try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself. Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate. Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring.

431,3209,F7FD0CB34BBC,"Everyone has a talent or skill. For Example, my talent is drawing. Drawing is really useful because I can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. To get good at something I enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. Every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly. Firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. For example,when I first started drawing. when I first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness. Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness. Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills. In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill.

Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time. When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin. Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting. Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience. They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.

438,2525,BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years? In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn: How to save up money for a better future How to have a better behavior You learn how to spell some stuff correctly How to write essays There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now.

441,770,04B6FD84A066,"Aiming for small goals and accomplishing them are pointless. although, it is not a bad idea to make small goals and achieve them however, aiming for a bigger achievement will help in the long run. Achievements that are harder or much bigger can teach you a lot during the process of failure. In my opinion failing at long term goals is more beneficial then achieving small goals. One reason why failing at long term goals is better then to achieve a small goal is that you keep learning when you fail it is a part of life that you need in order to have success. For example, You might never succeed or progress in something you havent failed at, failure helps you learn to do better and not make the same mistakes. Achieving small goals is not a bad idea but to fail while trying to go your hardest is better because that is your full potential and it helps in your future. Aiming for easier goals does not help learn about failure and you need failure to be successful and experienced. Having long term goals is the better way to go. For instance, you can have a goal that can go on for a couple years and when you accomplish it it will feel way better than something you didnt fail or get tired on. Long term goals also help you plan ahead and really perfect your craft or perfect what you are trying to accomplish. Having a goal that you can easily achieve does not help you with learning because you dont fail and it does not take tie and experience. For example, a goal is something you have to push to achieve, so if you dont have to fail and learn it is not a realistic goal. Accomplishing and working on something you know you can achieve is not really success. Goals are achievements that are supposed to benefit you. For example, if my goal was to learn how to swing a bat it wouldnt be better than my goal wanting to win the world series. small achievements come with big goals you can learn how to swing a bat while you are training for the world series. Aiming bigger will help you accomplish more then just your goal . It will also teach you skills like patience and practice and that you will accomplish small goals on the road to the big goal. As you can see, I agree with what Michelangelo said about aiming low and accomplishing your goal because when you aim low you dont really have a challenge or real goal. You dont get to experience failure and having to do so much to reach the goal. Aiming higher and failing is when you put your effort and you fail but when you learn from that failure and keep trying to achieve the goal in different ways you will achieve it as well as other small goals along the way.",9,8,10,9,8,8,61,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side. Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair.

446,3764,D30614F0911F,"Some schools are considering the idea to offer distance learning for students to attend classes from home. Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea. In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Second, they would not take it seriously. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. And third They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need. However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they cant travel. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Many students do not have transport. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. using the online program would give them a big support. In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. I do not support this idea. Students should not attend to classes online or video. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that theres no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because theres not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.

Cant stay at tee ball , have to practice to get to actual baseball. Emerson is therefore correct in stating "" Unless you try to do something beyond what have already mastered , you will never grow"" because to grow one must break out of comfort zone and failure leads to success. Failure lead to success, comfort zone knee jerk reaction, ""well I havent mastered anything yet so I cant adequately answer this questions"" Generic_Names example wants to mas painting. Opposition, mastering something is impossible scientific theories disproved got to school for 12 years, still have not learned everything therefore Emerson is wrong. Also, Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson states if people do not go beyond what they have already accomplished. They will never progress in life. Some peoples initial reaction would be "" I have not Masters anything, so I am unable to respond to this question."" There are a couple reasons why Emersons quote is correct. Growing requires breaking out of comfort zones and broadening horizon. If a person does not go beyond what they are capable of archiving they will not grow. Failure assists to growing and learning to lead to success. If people never expand their horizons, the they never experience new adventure life can offer. Without the thrill of a new experience, life would become aborning repetition of activities we have already mastered. Therefore, to break out of a comfort zone, people must go beyond what we have already mastered. One day at school, our band class attended a piano recital put on by Generic_School students. Even though, I was not part pf their piano class, I decided to perform unannounced. As I walked upon the stage, a my emotions flooded my body, such as nervous, anxious. However, to become a better piano performed, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and perform for entire piano and band classes. Just as Emerson said humans must go beyond a mastered trait, or comfort zone, to better themselves and not miss possible opportunities.

450,1025,EF9D616EAC4E,"On group works either at school, job or any other place or activity that you could do, sometimes you have the option of working with someone or multiple people, and you can also have the option of working by yourself, we all have our own opinion of either if we would like to do our work by our selves or to work with someone or multiple people for different reasons,and we can all have benefits or working with someone or working individually,and here are going to be reasons why it would be good to work either individually or in group. When we have the option of working individually or in group, some people may choice i different choice of how they would like to work for different reasons, some people may like to work in groups because they feel that may have more possibilities of talking to their friends or someone that they like, or they may feel that they work may get complicated or may take longer and that they may need help to accomplish it,so they would like to work in group to get help and to finish the work faster. Some people that would like to work individually may chose that choice because maybe they like to be alone and work by themselves,or maybe because they feel that they okay and that they dont need the help from anyone else to finish or do the work. In some cause on school, teachers sometimes dont like or dont prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person wont do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work,or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that,and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work,then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesnt know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the him/her how to do the work ,and them she/he can be able to do the work,and they all can be able to participate in the activities. Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work,and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to met people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you dont know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.",6,6,6,7,7,6,3517,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
451,699,8EF3D97E2310,"The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success. Chances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day. Having a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success. Reaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. Elon Musk created a company named ""SpaceX"" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude. In conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. Every individual can have a different explanation for their goal, and the goal is the positive influence in their life. Trying to make the positive influence in your life with out positive attitude is impossible. Positive attitude is the key to success.",8,7,8,8,6,6,1899,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

453,2399,B0D627CB7309,"The American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" I believe that the meaning that this quote was trying to convey is that when we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging that problem is we must use it as a chance try our best. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. When we are faced with a problem it does not matter how challenging the problem is we must use it as a chance to try our best. Completing a group project, homework, or writing an essay are one of the few examples that can represent how sometimes it doesnt matter how big the problem is we must try our best. Finishing a group project, homework might seem as though it would be something that could be completed without difficulty it does take a bit of an effort for some people. However these people keep on trying because they want a good grade or dont want to fail class. This might apply to people that are still in school but being responsible and completing all of this work might prepare them for their future careers. Sometimes a lot of things can happen unexpectedly but we must believe in ourselves that a problem could be an opportunity to try our best, it might also prepare us for bigger problems in the future. For example athletes, athletes sometimes sustain injuries while playing and have to recover. These injuries are not easy to recover from as it could damage a part of their body that could possibly prevent them from playing for some time. To overcome these problem athletes train a lot and use it as an opportunity to train and rest more to be in a good condition before finally playing with the rest of their team. These shows how sometimes you have to take advantage of something an use it as something to try your best on. Although sometimes we might experience difficulties while trying to solve that problem in our lives we just have to keep on giving it our best to overcome it. Occasionally we encounter difficulties while trying to find the solution to a problem in our lives an example of this could be having to give a speech in front of a large audience. Some people t dont like speaking in front of a large group of people this can be a problem in their lives. These people have to be able to control their nervousness, something that could be hard to control. These people try hard to overcome a problem that is stopping them from doing certain things. All of this examples represent how sometimes were faced with problems that can be difficult to let go off. I think that the meaning of the quote is something important as it can apply to certain situations that are rather difficult. This quote shows us how sometimes there a certain problems in our lives that can be very difficult but we should try hard and do our best. I believe that there a lot of problems that we can learn from because sometimes while trying to solve those problems we make mistakes and we can learn form those mistakes and move on. I agree with this quote ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" I think its describes how sometimes we need somethings to happen in life that will makes us want to try harder to achieve our goals.

For example, it would made students to be on task and be focused in their classes. The will help students to get good grades and to keep students active in all their classes. Changing school lunch menu will have a big impact in students, more people will start to get food and its going to help their brain to think more. My second reason is students prefer good food than healthier food the taste nasty. In addition, mostly all students would prefer to eat regular food the is healthier. However,it doesnt have nothing to do with your body if you dont want to be fat because of the food you received, thats because you dont care about your body. Students will have to start worrying about their body not about the food they eat. My last reason is about the benefits of receiving healthier school menu at school. For example, students will enjoy more their lunch. students would choose what to eat and students would have time to interact with theirs friends while they eat their lunch. In conclusion, i think is a good idea for school to change the lunch menu.

458,2495,82F7210163B5,When learning at school with other students who cause distractions it is always hard to focus would you be able to focus? Even though going to school makes you socialize with friends and they feed you it sometimes is hard for a student to show up to school or even learn. For me I would rather work on my assignments and others things my teacher would like me to do at home reason why is that some students would not be able to focus especially when a student is causing lots of noise making it hard for you to focus on your assignment. Another reason is that some students could live far from the school making it hard to get to school everyday. Finally students could have more time to work and study making it easy for students to revise in a quite place at home. Students could limit distractions in many ways at home one way is that they can put on headphones to relax and work hard and listen to some music. Some teachers hate when students have their phone out or when they are listening to music so begin at home may cause the student to focus more by listening to music because every student has a different way of studying and one student might be more focus if he or she loves listening to music when working or studying. This also makes the student more relived that he or she can listen to music. Students who are always trying to bust a joke or make a noise causes problems for a student who is trying to work to get her grade up this makes it very hard for a student to focus on what their are supposed to do. Students can benefit from listening to music because for me when I listen to music while I am working I feel great and energetic making it easy for me to knockout my work at a fast rate. Some students could live far away from the school and may not have a reliable ride to take them to school everyday. Some students cant catch the bus because the bus is too far away from their house this makes going to school very difficult because without a reliable ride to school everyday you may be coming to school very late making it hard for you to study or work on assignments because you are worried about how you will get home because you do not have a reliable ride to school to home. This makes a student stress a lot thats why working at home you would not be worried about who would be taking to and back from school. It also makes the student more productive because they would not have to find a ride all the time they could study and get their work done faster than other people. Also coming to school late makes it very hard to understand what was taught in the classroom making a student very stressed over it because a student grade might go down because he or she failed the test cause they came late to school so that student might not have understood what was taught. Finally students could have more time to study and work on their assignments sometimes teachers may go through the assignment very quickly making it hard for a student to understand the what he or she or supposed to do. Also teachers may not give as much time for students to finish assignment working at home makes it easier because you have as much time as needed for you to complete your assignment and also for a student to revise over their work before turning it in to the teacher students may not be able to turn in assignments on time depending on the assignment this makes a student very stressful because they do not want to turn in the assignment late and get a late grade for it. Sometimes students worry about things like this especially when a student grade is flunking and they need to get it up to graduate or move on to the next grade level. Although going to school could very exciting for a student or very happy to see friends your happiest place is home and if you could a student could work from home that would change the way a student studies and complete assignment because they have time on their hands and also the are relaxed they would not have to sit in a class for over 55 minutes. Working at home could be very beneficial because It could be very difficult for another student to learn at school because they might be that one student who is making it hard for a student trying to focus or a student might be stressed because they might not have a ride to and back from school and worried that they might not enough time to finish their assignment and get it turned in on time. Working at home may not stress a student because they would have enough time to complete an assignment. This is why working on assignments at home would benefit a student. ,7,7,8,8,7,7,1728,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
459,194,B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time? Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone elses life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself. When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself. You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself. Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms. In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it.

If the school simplify by pushing the controls and the extracurricular activities for the students, their are more productive at school and teaching-learning process undoubtedly be win-win for all the participants involved in this activities.

Students can be more productive at school and in their activities, because the schools bring the opportunity to parctice some sport. I truly believer that having the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities can be more would better is the right step towards a more convenient and enjoyable educational experience, and considered that schools offered the potential that students have to developed their potential, by and large school count with the necessary instruments that students needed, lastly school helped the students a level physical with the sports, I hope my voice get heard to the schools and their make this issues, schools can be more productive if their has the control with the students.",7,5,6,5,4,6,779,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

If they want to help they should talk with the people if want help or not. I know everyone want to help out but sometime they dont want help for other people,friends or their family. They could solve their problem at there own. For example we dont need people to tell other people how to live their life. They can make their decisions. They a lot people that make bad decision or good decisions in their life. It good that they did bad choice because they real what they did and they wont do it again in their life. People can live their life but they have to make good choice their life not bad choice. They should have good friends that make good decision in their that always help them in their life. If you have a friend that make bad decision sometime at friends wont help you out. Then you are on your own with youre problem. Sometime good to hang out with friends but you have to make good choice if youre going to hang out with your friends. I know people can make own decision and can help other people to not make bad choice in life. Is good you got friends and family that have your back when you want to make own decisions in your own life. Sometime family dont agree with your choice or decision you want to make. Youre life is important you should make good choice in youre life to happy or live your life with youre familys and friends. You dont have to wrong about other people opinion. Sometime good to listing to other people opinion if it will help you understand your problem or to make good decision or not. Some people dont want help for other people.

463,715,6A977849DE08,"More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting. So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person. You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something thats completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldnt give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test. You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing its more likely to be true than the one that doesnt. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when youre working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong. Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you dont understand the information or dont have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just dont understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and thats what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didnt have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them. If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure its correct and the best.

464,3264,343A80DD6FB3,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can checkout books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives? Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty. Especially when phones are advancing in the next years. One day, technology will take over the human population. Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media, but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc. They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but theres rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully youll be there too. Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone, but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it? Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see whats more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day. Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination.

466,1452,E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in peoples minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives. The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called "" I Have A Dream "" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites segregation laws was. The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset. The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration. In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.",10,8,10,8,8,9,3354,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

For example, to prevent making poor choices or decisions, to determine which advice is accurate, and to allow someone to feel secure with choices. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice. First, seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions. For instant, if someone attempts to steal. If theres something you want but its expensive. Also, if someone gets in a fight. If theres someone you dont like or disagree with. Lastly, if someone lies.

Furthermore, seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice by determining which advice is accurate. For example, to be sure that its reliable. If many said the same thing while others said a different thing. Also,if someone wasnt sure about the advice. Ask people for more advice if the advice is inaccurate. Lastly, if the advice is inaccurate. If someone said one thing while others said the other thing. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice.

In summary, viewing many opinions can benefit people to make a better choice by preventing making poor choices or decisions, determining which advice is accurate, and by allowing someone to feel secure with choices.

469,3071,876CDA4D152D,"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldnt commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they dont want to do anything. A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasnt something that she wanted because she didnt like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind. Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I cant commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I cant commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it. There are many students at my age that really dont want to do anything with their life or they dont have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably its something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive. Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldnt only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

The little kids always look up to the big kids. Also maybe the little kids wont gave up so easy.

472,175,2A96CE614119,"A famous British writer once said ""your character will be what you yourself choose it."" His name was John Lubbock. What he wanted to state is that we choose what we want to be from here on out and, that know one chooses for us. Another question that was asked was, ""is our character formed by influences beyond our control."" No we control all of our actions so what John wanted to say is that our character and character traits are based on the choices we make and still making. We are always in control and know what we are doing on a daily bases. We always know what well happen based on the actions we take, its common sense. Its like when you argue to a teacher we know its bad and we know what comes after that and that is going to the principals office. Nothing is never out of our control is weather we want to stop it or just let it happen. Most of the time our actions are based on bad things like smoking for an example we know its bad but its in influences or the people that make us do it. So thats why we need to stop listening to that bad side and listen to our good side. The character we are right now as a person is based on the life choices we made. If it wasnt for the good or even the bad choices we made in life we wouldnt be the person we today. Everything is bases on what we do and what we dont do. For example is we study hard enough and work hard as well we can get to the college or job of our dreams. But to do that we have to make good life choices and good decisions. Like i said before the person we are today is based on ALL the choices we made starting from when we were little to how we are right now. We are far from perfect but we try to make the best decisions or perfect is you say. As we humans we know we are not perfect and shall never be perfect but that doesnt mean we dont try to make perfect decisions. For starters we know our rights from our wrongs. So we know our good decisions from our bad decisions and you would think that its easy to choose the right one but in reality its not. The more bad it is the more we want to do it. Its just human nature one well say BUT we most of the time we dont choose that side want to know why. Its because we are always in power and its never out of our control. Some yes but most others NO. In conclusion we know that nothings never out of our power. We know that person we are today is based on the life choices we made. That we know our rights from our wrongs, our positive and negative.

473,777,234F1BA430B7,"Why is it important to learn the experience from others? Its important because you know what youre going to do or you know what youre going to see. For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw. When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what theyve expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because theyve told you what theyve experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad. So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesnt want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when its his time to shine. Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like youre new student and a bunch of girls see youre hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think shes so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isnt as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a persons will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it. Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelonas beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets. It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didnt let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too. Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messis video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more. Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer. Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play. Anybody in this world can be the greatest soccer player but the key is to work hard and challenge yourself every single day to become better. No one is perfect that is why we have to practice all the time to be better person in our lives.",8,9,10,10,10,9,829,"conventions 9, grammar 10, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

I feel strongly that I dont like work alone because its very boring and takes long time to finish work. However, I do like to work with a group because its so much fun and you will experience with others and its more easy to do something. First, Working with a group is so much fun especially when you are do something with your best friends. When you are work with your friends they makes you laugh so hard and we do lot of fun things togethor. Some of my friends actually works well with other people. When I have a free time I like to play games with my friends. In the game you will team up with your friends and play against another team. You have to talk to your friends every single time and lesson to their idea to win game. Most of video games needs to be really good team work. You cant do anything by yourself. Second, When you are working with a group you will interaction and feel the other people. Its like social experience. Talk to your team-mates, lesson and support their idea. Working a group is way better than working by yourself. If you are learning English by yourself its very hard but if you had a teacher then its much easy to learn and quickly Finally, You can do things very quickly because there is a more than one person working.

You have to clean entire house by yourself and it takes long time to finish but if you clean with your brother or sister then its quite faster than clean by yourself.

485,427,88816FFD8A5C,"Online Learning Who doesnt want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when theyre in their house, students cant have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home. Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Names text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher. Secondly, taking classes online doesnt just mean you dont have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one. Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You cant always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people arent perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasnt functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone. In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.

Because I get to practice my singing skills,I can learn from others,and also I can perform in from of people. I can do this by staying after school so i can practice more skills,or ask the teacher or students for help when I need too. I think practicing your voice skills is very important if you want to enjoy the chorus class because you can get alot out of it. Ones youre out of the basics you can get more advance classes. Secondly i think learning from others can help you because if you dont know something that other student knows you can ask if they can help you. Also seen what other student might do you can get an example from them or you can do what they are doing for you to get better at it. Also when it gets to performing in front of alot of people I might get nervous because Im not use to that I might even forget the lyrics of the song that Im singing ,but ones youve done alot of performs you are not going to be afraid of going to sing in front of alot of people. In conclusion, joying a chorus class can be fun because you can be with your friends or you can make new friends,and you can learn your singing skills,you can also learn from others and ask for help when you need too.

487,906,6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college. First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they dont have enough money, and parents cant support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students wont need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud. Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you wont have to worry about being alone. Lastly, Some students dont turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isnt only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you dont have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already. I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you arent mature enough, then you will struggle. In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldnt have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

489,640,5F467A8F3896,"What are people going do if they find themselves in a situation of danger because of meting the wrong person on social media? No body would like the idea of being on danger but if we do not know how to manege social media we all are in danger. What are people going to do if they find themselves all alone because they did not take the chance of meting someone new, o because they did not enjoy the little moments whit their family? How could someone think that human communication is not necessary? People would not have the chance of having a nice chat whit their family or friends. Although some people say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect because it helps people whit communication problems interact whit other people due social media, actually the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects because people miss priceless moments whit their family and friends and there is a high risk of meting someone dangerous on social media. People say that the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has a positive effect. This is because they think that it helps people whit communication problems interact whit others due social media. Many studies have showed that social media is very helpful for those people that are insecure of themselves to interact whit others not just from their city but whit people from different places in the world. Technology is advancing, and it is trying to help people whit different needs. In this case technology allows people from everywhere to communicate whit others does not matter the place they are. It is a privilege for the people that are far away from their families. It is also a way that people use to get away from having uncomfortable chats whit people from their surroundings. However the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects. Because people miss the opportunity of having nice moments whit their family, their families start to break apart. Thats the case of my cousins family. they were a beautiful family but everything went apart because my cousins wife spent most of her time on Facebook, where she found a random guy, so she left my cousin whit their three daughters and one son. social media can destroy families and relationships in seconds, but is our duty to enjoy our time whit the people that we love because we show the love that we feel for them and communication by technology can never do that. We do not know if one day the people we love are going to leave, but if they leave we are going to keep those priceless memories on our heart. Family is everything and we should never let anything get us apart from it. Even if social media allows people from everywhere interact whit each other; there is a high risk of met whit someone dangerous. There are many cases where young ladies have being abducted. This happen when young ladies decide to met boys from social media that result not being what they thought but kidnappers. Those kidnappers sale the young ladies, and this poor girls are forced to give up on themselves and work as prostitutes. All of this could be avoided if we start to know better about the people near us instead of trying to met someone that we dont know anything about . Its important to recognize that social media have benefits if we know how to use it correctly, but we need to be careful because we have to know other people better before trusting them, and it is even better if we already have had a chat in person whit those people. In conclusion the world is constantly changing and technology is an important factor in actuality, but in those cases where technology is used incorrectly many people can get damaged. Technology is not a need but is a benefit, and if we are allowed to use it, we should do it whit responsibility and not depend from it. In spit of the fact some people believe that technology is more than necessary, and that there is no need of human interaction because it helps people with communication problems, in truth the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has just negative effects because we can experience more than one danger; like losing our family or being forced to a prostitute. Communication in person is necessary, there is no better way of live our life than enjoying the time whit our family, the little chats and of curs taking the opportunity of get to know better each one near us. A computer or a phone can never transmit our feelings, and if people want to express themselves they do not have to be trapped on technology.

491,3446,B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone youre not. You wont have to meet some jobs perspectives. You wont have to be someone youre not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life. The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some jobs ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they dont like the response. But, there are some jobs that will accept you and will like who you are truly. Second of all dont have to be someone youre not. You shouldnt have to please others only because they dont like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isnt. You shouldnt have to be the opposite of who you are just so you dont get judged on. Pay no attention to those who dont accept you for being nothing but yourself, and dont change for them unless youre doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what. Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you cant even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world wants them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more. In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you wont meet jobs perspectives, be someone youre not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where.

492,1184,FE7408E48786,"Students get their longest break on summer when they finish the first ten months of the school year; however, they will forget the information they have been taught in school when they get back in fall if they spend this long vaccation for only partying, going for a trip, or without taking classes online. Also those people who argue that there should be a year round schools and summer should be a 3-4 weaks break, it will be a less time break for most students who have planned to do their own projects while reading and without forgeting what they have learned. First, when students complete thier school year and started planning what to do for thier summer vaccation, spcially teens will put partying on the first list. There are some students who are doing worse than this, doing nothing but waiting for their friends party. Students dont realize that they are wasting thier time on partying untile the coming scholl year approaches. This doesnt just waste their time on thier vaccation when they can take classes online or school closer to where they live in but they are wasting thier money instead of saving it for their college tutition. Second, when someone goes for a trip, they will observe information and learn from what they have seen when travelling. On the other hand, when students are going for a trip, most of them will be taking pictures of themselves only without paying attention, observing ideas, or learning from what they see on the trip. If they were paying attention when travelling without just taking pictures of themselves, they were going to get benefitted for some classes like history and geography. Third, in the summer long vacation if students are not going to summer schools or studying at home, they definetly should be taking online courses to help them not to retain information as easily when they return to school on fall. When students are not studying ortaking classes over the summer, their brain is not developing which makes them not to be a creative or open minded. Plus, it is hard for most students who was enjoying summer without taking classes and getting back to school when it opens to understand like other students who have taken summer schools in their long vacation. In conclusion, I dont agree with the idea that there should be year round schools to prevent students from not retaining information when they return to new school year from their summer vacation. Instead of creating a year round schools, students can enroll themselves to summer school and study with their parents support. Additionally, if there is a longer winter break in the middle of the schools year, students most likely will forget what they have been taught before even finishing the full school year. Furthermore, long summer vacation is helpful to complete what one student has planned. As the matter of fact, even if there is a 3-4 week break in the summer, students will still not retain information easily when school starts if they dont use their vacation time wisely on purpose.",8,8,7,8,7,7,3871,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
493,3815,570595740274,"Do students need summer break or they can handle not have summer but with more breaks around the year? Students need summer break because students like summer more than other other times in the year because is hot outside and it doesnt snow all the day also, during break some students can do things that they couldnt do because of the school. For example have a job, just enjoy and relax outside with family and friends or have big families plans that they were expected, students have more odds to do all that in summer because. They can put all their effort in their jobs. almost all the students that I know have summer job in fact I actually have two summer jobs. For students have a summer job is actually very important and it means a lot because it can be the first thing that they actually put all their effort, and is not only the fact that they put all their effort it can be the fact that they can be helping their family for example. Their mom is having a bad time at work, the sells went down, is being two weeks since the last buyer went to the store, is not something new at the store that could bring buyer, and is being a bad moth for their mom, their son will try to help her paying small things like the internet, the water, the light or he could actually do his best, paying all that and paying the rent of the house, some teenagers not only work in summer for their own good some teenager work for help their family with everything they can however. Sometimes they need relax, doing nothing or going out to eat, watch a movie with friends or family, or go to party with your friends and enjoy summer how I said, I have two summer jobs. The first one is in construction and the second one is in a place called Generic_Name. My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldnt do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students dont have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like. Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually dont spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be. because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden wont die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however. Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best. Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long? No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",6,5,7,7,5,6,1124,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
494,299,610FA0016255,"Self-esteem doesnt come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts weve done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, thats why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem. Some people believe in praising a students to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention. Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while theyre doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldnt do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has. First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they dont, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they dont. In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us whats to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, well not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because wed already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove were good on something, its completetly wrong, you dont have to get an achievement to prove youre good on something you like it or enjoy to do. The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because youre waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself. Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every humanve had self-esteem issues at least once and thats alright. I think we shouldnt depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, weve to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, thats where self-esteem comes from.",7,6,5,6,6,6,1264,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Deligence leads us to a road of success. For example, The successful people are always willing to spend times and put efforts in their work. In history, a lot of leaders showed us that success comes from keeping doing and trying things over and over to make it what it is today. When we become deligent, we spend our time doing meaningful things. We become more efficient and tend to be more responsible for our lifes, it pushes us forward to our destinations in a good way. Experiencing lets us learn more. For example, We learn from books and documentaries about what other people have experienced or doing different things by ourselves then gain perspectives from it. Those things make us talented and gives us guides about how things might be when we grow up. It also gives us advantages when we encounter difficult things and try to deal with it.

501,880,BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldnt want to graduate a year early right? but in the end its not even worth it. I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesnt make you more than them, it doesnt make any student seem smart, its just them taking the short cut to end school. I believe it isnt a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resumes, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished. Another reason why I dont think its a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students whod want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, dont do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isnt a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesnt make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isnt the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that dont even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job thatll pay you well and something that you know youll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months. For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who dont plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just dont take the school serious but only if they knew that, thats the key for them to open to get to their future. If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, Id think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that theyd want to get a head start with their career. Thats good Im not saying its bad, its just something I wouldnt do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity. In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life.

Some of them need to make money, and they take the summer break to make it. That is why I am not agree the educators that doest wants the summer break long. One reason,the students are in the school almost a whole year, and all that time they are stressed by all the work they have to do in the school. Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the schools work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a schools stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the schools time the students doest have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the schools year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the schools work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and dont take the schools time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Finally, the student doest need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it wouldt be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.",6,6,6,5,5,5,1443,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Generic_City park its located in Pennsylvania and is one of the places I would like to go there with my family. One of the reasons is because there are great attractions, like roller coasters and games.

The Super dooper looper is one of the greatest roller coasters and the reason is because this roller coaster has more loops then the other attractions and one of the loops is super big. But thats just the beginning, there is also one section in Generic_City park that I would like to go too, and is the area where all the video games are and you can win tickets every time you win a game. You can win prizes with those tickets and you can also buy food near that place. I also said that I wanted to see the chocolate factory.

509,457,A5B9C9F26FD6,"Generic_Name Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activitys would they have. what if he/she doesnt like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way. Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldnt be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation. Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there. It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"". I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isnt fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders. Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude. Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didnt like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts. So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity. Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",6,7,7,7,8,7,2223,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

I think more people should start being kind to other. tell me this when someone is kind to you. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you thats kindness they were kind to come and help you. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it.

511,389,15F6B5C6229A,"I will agree with the Emersons statement,but this can depend too the point view. This is one of the example: There is a men who is an entrepreneur and he have a little company,and he decide to make it more big,but he dont know if he is going to do it. If you dont try to do it you will never grow, you have to do new things for you know you will have to try something beyond of you already mastered. The way I understand this is if you dont try to do something that you already know, you will never learn a new things that you dont know,because there is not way to grow if you dont over pass your self or you dont try it and that is going to provoke that you cant advance to grow or even stock in the way you try to make to grow. Example: When I was 15 years old, the only thing I did was just studying. Although when I start to think about my future and then I figure out I have to do more than just studying, I have to choose which college Im going and work to earn money for I can pay my college and expenses I have in my house or personal,because you have to do something for you can over pass your goals or you will never grow. But some people maybe think or have different opinions about this,perhaps people say like its a lie or you cant do it because its impossible and also that is fake. Every one dont thing the same, maybe they a different point to see it,they just dont want or they have a another way to grow. The majority of people are going to say yes,because they already lived the moment that if you want to grow, you have to go beyond of the things you already know or youll never going to trust your self. My opinion is that maybe this wrote of Emerson is true and the reason why im saying this is that you have to do things new and over pass your self ,and doesnt matter if you already mastered something,if you want to grow you have to try it because you cant grow if you dont do different things that you have not idea about how you can grow and make or dominate more things that you cant believe.",5,6,6,6,4,7,298,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

513,1187,60D9DD69CE8D,"Generic_Name March 14, 2019 Writing SOL Where is one place you would like to visit? I would like to visit Florida because they have really nice weather. Florida is something special to me because I have family in Florida. The place I would visit is my grandfather grave because my grandfather had died last year To, begin The reason why I picked Florida is because I have really nice, cool family in Florida. My grandfather had dies last year after he had fell and hit his head on the ground. He is special to me because if it wasnt for him I would not be playing soccer right now. Every time I score a goal i always do a celebration for him. I have something valuable of his and that is the gold chain that I got on now that he gave me and I had never took the chain ever since he gave it to me. I will take off this chain the day I die. I had promised him that I will love soccer forever and go to college to play soccer. The college that Im going to is Generic_School. The reason why I would like to go to this college is because I had went there for a scholarship and I had got the scholarship and they said that I am really good for my age. Here go some tips if your not good at soccer you should go outside and practice makes perfect. If your not good at it you should try I mean it is really not a hard sport if you think about it. If someone say that you suck let them keep on telling you that for me I will take that as motivation. The reason why I love soccer so much is because of my grandfather he loved soccer just like me. Everytime I had went to Florida to go visit family me and my grandfather we would always watch soccer games and tell me some formation to play when I grow up. The favorite things that my grandfather love to do was drawing, playing soccer and teach me some new moves. Every morning we would wake up he will always take me and my brother to waffle house and we would tell some stories to me and my brother about what he did when he was growing up. When he had fell and went to the hospital I was not but when my mom face time my aunt he found out that we could not move body shoulders down and then he had to get some brain surgies and all that then the week after all that he had died and we face timed my aunt and he prayed on the phone and we all was crying. I had a soccer game the day after he died and I had scored 6 goals and every time I had scored I had always kissed my hand and point it up to the sky. After the game I was crying because I was proud of my self that I played a game with all that stress over my shoulders and I said to my self I did that for my grandfather. Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do. That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often. My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today. My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather. All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him. When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player. He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to. When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son. When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us. In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do. This why I play soccer just because of him. Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated. He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board. Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida: Family and my grandfather grave. I would like to go to Generic_City studios. Go to the beach and get some nice weather. In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit? I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather. Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida. The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters. Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.

515,288,6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how its used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when weve missed an important assignment or other things. The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of its dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school. Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however youd like. This is where a teenagers habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We dont have the right to control how people use their phone and thats where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone. Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just dont suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phones are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices. I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our students with how theyre approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",9,8,9,8,9,9,1319,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
516,883,269101ABF266,"Do you think students taking an elective class is a good idea? Will I think its a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation. So this are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea. Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor so she can get put in a art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she good at while getting a grade for it. Students can learn how to draw if they had a art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students a art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students dont know that. One day, my mom took a art class because she want to learn how to draw. But the art class didnt just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing. Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to be come a artist later on in life. I know a lot of artist who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can be come famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students. These are the reason why I think students should have art as an elective class some students love to drawn, some students want to learn, others can even using in life.

He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how and he told me that there was soda every where. it was messy and it had mentos in it and I was like please give me an A or can i at least remake it.

It kinda worked if I put a little in a bootle and light it like that but thene I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it and it did and then i kept putting more and more news paper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it it was hard because i didnt know which way to put it.

Also some students might change that career because they want the best for them selves and its not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one thats doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person and it doesnt matter how much money your making its STILL MONEY!!!! and some people around the world still dont get that. Soon they will want to go to college and thats big step into having their career because theres more studying to it and the teachers arent as nice as you think they are and they will be very comfortable with you goofing off in class, after that your out of the game, also it a lot of money to pay yearly for their tuition and depending if your were born poor, rich, some what rich or wealthy enough to pay then your fine to stay in their to study party relax and play video games with the boys and eat a lot too if your close to a restaurant, cafe, buffet or a diner then go ahead and fill up that empty stomach. After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate theyll go to a University, and I gotta tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life. Now that we got that out of the way, we need to talk about how the students are going to be effected by by all that has happened to them and how far got to that end point of their journey to be successful in life and be some people he or she can help one another so they make that persons life better and make them feel happy, the students need to be happy with how they are working because if they dont they can have stress and anxiety and soon they dont want to work any more and we cant have that in our generation, so we have to let them be someone that they want to be before some one else will!. Before all that, about all I said about the colleges and universities, their Parents, oh yeah the big dogs the ones who have created you to be a good person with a good career their child/student get older, the students have to tell their parents what they want to be when they grow up to be an adult, yes I know that they always say that when you were a little kid, but your still a kid but a teenager from the age 13-17, your still going to be told that and you have pursue your dream or goal of being someone that goes without saying, so this is why students should identity their careers by the time they enter high school.",4,4,6,4,4,5,3807,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

First of all this essay is written with the meaning of what kind of occupations I would like to do as student, which is good to know that there is someone that is interested on helping students like me, also as student I would like to start by the right way and taking what is the best for me for example what is going to be a job which will make me feel comfortable to know that my qualities and my knowledge will play an important roll depending of the job that I might get. To tell you more about what I like to do is simple and easy at the same time, it doesnt matter how hard something it gets for me because in the end I always end up pulling through, althought I like to think before make a choise because is always hard when I do stuffs at the very beginning with no concern or knowledge of what am I suppose to do. In this case, as a beginner I get excited no matter what the work it might be, I can tell that Im not afraid to begin with new chalenges. So one of the reasons you should invite me for job oportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they dont have the spirit of a fighter like I do, because I always try to give it all Ive got because I know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if ""if you dont fight for it dont expect for the things that you want to come for you"", and to prove myself that I can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it,so I can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing I do is what I have to make sure that I can be capable and responsible of doing it. In the other hand lets say that at least for now I want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is would it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a really good starting for me, after all I think I can show you what I mean by saying I dont give up because my father always told me when I was a little kid; no matter what happens after I had to give it all, never leave a little bit of what I could let on my effort, also because he is been a great example for me since I was a kid or since I remember my childhood. Instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do I have to to with my values and things that really matter to me, so that is pretty much of what I can be capable of when it becomes to a responsibility. Persistent is other word that goes with my personality, if you want someone who really want to do something when it becomes to work, I think I might have the qualities that you are looking for any kind of job. So thats my response to what you might be looking for, i just hope that you can choosr me, Thanks. ",6,5,7,6,6,7,3743,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
521,1272,D537BE6997F7,"I agree with success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because everyone need to be stronger, successful, and become independent youself. Success are things that everybody need to be stronger the most they can with every single thing in your life because everyone has bad moments in lifes and there are many peoples that they want to see them fail in everything. For example, if someone is given in they can find someone who is bad person and the only thing that they do is to given words that did not help in anything, but thats why they have to failure, but do not have to loss enthusiasm because if you loss enthusiasm you are failed in everything because in lifes you can find peoples that want to help you a lot, but sometimes you are going to find good peoples that want to help you in everything. Therefore, it does not matter what other peoples want to tell you people just have to continue their lifes and do not have to give up in anything, it does not matter peoples have to do everything they can because if you propose what you want you can do it no one is going to said no. Success is that everyone has to be successful in lifes because everybody has to be esthusiasm in everything. You do not have to loss that because you have to be with good smile because it does not matter what is happened in your life you must have to had a good smile in everything because it does not matter how many times in your lifes you are falling you have to continue because if you do not do a good job, thinking that you can not do what you want, or said that you are going give up in everything. For example, if your sister said that some people said that she can not make her dream true you can talk with her with enthusiasm and said that she can do everything she can propose because she do not have to listen those peoples that can not want their lifes good they failature is her past that means that others peoples are going to do the same thing because in this lifes exist peoples that want the bad thing to you that ever can exist. Success something in life is more harder than you think because you have to pass a lot of thing in your life and you have to stay strong the more you can because if one day you are going to fail in something and there is no one to give you support and you can not anymore, but you have to said in your mind that it does not matter because you are thinking in your mind that you are never give up with anything because you have your mind with power, esthusiasm, and stronger. However, you do not have to be thinking bad things there are some times that you failure with many things that can be in the school, work, or test. You always have to be in mind that it does not matter how many times you took your test and get bad grades you have to do it until you get good grade or how many days you are going to take to learn any kind of food the thing is the you have to be a good person to show to other peoples that you can do whatever you want to show to the world that you can do everything you want because they are here to fail, but if you lose a lot of time you are going to wake up twice. Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because in this world everyone is here to be something in their life to be someone stronger to make your skills stronger to show to the peoples that you want to be someone with energy to show that there are so many things that you want to do be a successful person to help peoples when they need something; it does not matter what you are passing or what your life is give you. You just have to learn how to be a good person, how you can make your skills stronger, and how you can demostrated to yourself what you can do and can not do because that is a harder to know yourself to see what you can do or not because you can see more peoples that if they can not do anything they do not tried anymore they are sad, mad, or angry with their self because they can not do what they wanted. For example, if your friend want to be in the future a teacher and he/she has to learn, to be prepared, and study. He may not want all of that or he/she may have travel with all of those things he/she is going to get mad with herself, sad with herself, angry with herself and he/she is going to said no i can not with all of this is so harder that i think, but everyone has to be stronger show that you do not have to get mad to show with enthusiasm that does not matter how many times you may fail you have to learn, study, be prepared everything you need and you will see that you can everything you want. In conclusion, Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you have to be stronger, successful, and become independent yourself because you have to be stronger with any problem in your life, stronger with every person, and stronger with whatever you have to do. You have to be successful with yourself, with your work, and with your own things. You have to be independent with yourself because when you are older or you are lonely you have to see for your owns things, you have to fight for you owns problems, and for your owns bussiness. For example, if you are going to be a good police you have to see what is coming what your enthusiasm is going to be what you have to be. You have to fail many things, but you have to tried the most you can because is this life everything you do have to be with enthusiasm. Therefore, If you find a job and you boss said that you have to go to do a fish and you went, but you did it wrong and he said this is wrong you failure you have to tried again you have to go with enthusiasm not be angry or sad because you are going to do that with enthusiasm to said im going to do this rigth not wrong because everything you do with enthusiasm everything you will get more better and you will be happy because if you do everything good you are going to feel thatyou do a esthusiasm and good work.",6,5,6,5,5,7,2968,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
522,1366,A9F7B20A9483,"On my opinion I be agree with the statement because He was one of the minister,who has more power from others. Ms Winston had to help others. For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go. Them Lets say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: lets talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work. In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too. Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we dont have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future. But many student had a long history or someone didnt graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to whats hard to work after school and dont have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

523,553,E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change. First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes. Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other markeds prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live. Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. They are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job. In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change, because first impressions are naturally from the people, it come instantly as result of a new thing that people learn. And mind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind is who send the first impressions to the person. Also, people are not prepared to the first impressions, it come as a surprise.

524,681,BE68C5AB58A1,"Having you wonder why people able to accomplish so much just in few days? Today society people always works so much they miss out their opportunity in life. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasnt good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them. My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots; when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft. Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasnt good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. Another example I wasnt good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. I use thought that wasnt at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. This show that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. She always practical how to read in English and write English. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned. Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish. Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs. Never stop trying something new in life it will turn out be more successful then you never to be expected.

525,3009,907FC59841EC,I disagree to school board adding an half hours to school each day. I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family. some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students dont have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor. If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

526,3680,6F9741277AB3,"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life. One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better. Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistakes helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistakes will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful. Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

527,1045,451321E506A6,"I think students doing home assignments will not benefit the student, because it doesnt help the student grasp the same kind of concepts like other students that do go to school. The reason why I personally dont like home schooling is because if Im at home I wouldnt get my work done. Id be distracted by looking at my dog and looking at what my mom would be doing. Another reason why I would not like it is because Im not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldnt have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When youre home schooled youre mostly self-taught. One other reason why I wouldnt reccommend home schooling is because youre not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children. Some parent may be too overbearing or impatient, which may cause the child to react in a negative manner. I think home schooling is a bad idea is because he wouldnt get the proper education like most students in school. That could possibly effect the student and also that student is not interacting with other students which could lead to depression and axiety. If the parent loses their patience the child would start to act up on them. For all of these reasons home schooling is not a good idea.

529,2552,7DDFB0CA2BF8,"Author Ralph Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" He is totally wrong because to be yourself in a world and make the greatest accomplishment in your life, the wold do not have to take control over you liberty, you should take control over the world to accomplish whats you are going to be. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson did not think before writing these letter because to be yourself in a world, you should have to make your own decisions, do something that you would like to do, and being your self not letting the world to take control over your life. First thing, be yourself and never give the right to the world. To make that happen you should have to make your own decisions, because if you let the world to choose for you in the future you may get lost and tire about your life, because you let the world to take control over your life, and for not choosing your own decision. Being your self and not letting the world to try to make something else, is something that will bring goods in your future, because is something that you choose and you know why did you took it and why did you choose it. However, the peoples that let the wold to choose for them they will get tire about life. The second thing for accomplishment; and not letting the world to control you,is being your self and do what you like to do, never letting the world to do whatever it wants to do with you. If you want to do the greatest accomplishment in your life you should take something that you that you like to do. because when you do something that you like to do you will never going to get tire about doing it, when you like to do something and you wanted to be the greatest accomplishment, you are not going to feel that job like a job because is something that you like to do. But to make that happen and accomplish that dream. never led the world to do what ever it wants with you. Being your self and not letting the world to take control over your life, the best choice that you can do, because being yourself and choose your own decision will help you to know what to do,whats good , whats bad, what career to choose, and what goal to accomplish because the only person who know all about you is you. So you should not let the world to ruin their life, and take their own decisions and tell the world that you can do it in your own. Lots of people let the world to choose for them and in future they ruin their life and they dont know whats to do for not choosing the correct choice and because they let the world to choose for them. In conclusion, never led the world to change your life . because if you led the world to choose for you you will never going to get satisfy. Always be your self because if you led the world to choose for you will have a bad and sad feature for for not choosing the right decision. Always do a things what you like to do, like sports or a profession that you would like to be, if you choose things that you like you never going to feel it like a job. sometime you let the world to choose for you, but in the future you will get bored because you did not choose what you like.

530,567,D0C50EB5CB1F,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he says that if you dont do something you will stay in the same place and never grow up if life, you will not advance, and you conformed with what you have. I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, thats why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand. First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things. I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one dont stay with the same one because there are always theres a lot of things inside of us that we dont want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you dont want to do it. all people make them own decision but some of them dont know whats them capacity is. Sometimes they dont take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash. Like the feeling of a person they dont fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they cant feel the love that someone has for them thats the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up. As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom. If we make be thinking in this life we ave not gonna grow as a person if we are doing something that we are not suppose to. I think I think that respect is one of the most important part in the world. conclusion In conclusion I think that all people can always finds more opportunity and they can get more experience by doings new things and overcome a new person in life, and chase dream because if they chase that dream they can make it happen for real. I think that all people in this world has the capacity to do things in life but some of them dont want to do it because they just cant, and they stay there without doing nothing, they should chase that dream and never let it go.",4,6,6,4,4,6,2882,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 4"
531,8,763EF698F56B,"Well In this part I think is good and bad idea. I think is good because if they have any emergency in home they do not going to dismiss any classes they can take classes from home they have already tools do not needed to go outside they have everything in home, and the teacher they do not need to wake up early everyday, and also some family they are going to agree because now they do not are going to think every time how is my daughter or my son if they are safe or if they are in trouble. the bad things that if they going to give to all the students to take classes from only or video confederation some students they not going to do their work. in some others parts they do not have any internet or money to buy a computer they do not have opportunity that the others person have, also the teacher do not have any jobs they are going to need they works back, and some family they do not need to send to school to their sons because they do not have many or they want their son to work. Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision. if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future. If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility. If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up. if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers. so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work.

532,3114,B49D86AC2062,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm? its a 50% chance you will be successful,reason for this is that some people give up too easily,some people get tired of failing and failing again. You dont need to fail many times before you get successful. Some people never put in work to be successful as they are today some just became successful out the cut. Right now the world we live in you dont really need to put in alot of effort,there are many ways of being successful for example we have social media! Social media now has a big impact in the world we live in. Scientists are perfect examples of this statement. A scientist can start an experiment and fail over and over again till they get they expected the results. Students can fail a test over and over again but whiles hes failing hes learning from his mistakes to pass his test. Working on something new or getting used to something new,you wont get it right the first time you would mess up or fail but once you keep getting used to it you learn from your mistake which helps you to become successful. If you ask most successful people of today,some might respond by saying they experienced alot of failure on the way to the top some might respond with a no,this states that failure might plays a role in being successful it may also not play a role in being successful.

533,3184,BB38DB117F33,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. People who start a career can make it happen. Students who took it early can ask their counsler for advices. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students doesnt have to worry about making one in the future. Starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time. Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class. It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life. It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write ""dont know"" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essintial to make a plan first before making a career at a young age. Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses. When ever they took their class about two ore three weeks, they usually will give up. Kids will often write ""dont know"" on their career paper. Making a career will take time for people to make, but dont give up easily if they cant pace up.",6,6,6,5,5,6,2521,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Technology is hurtful for all the people. For reason person learn how to get dope for the technology. Examples they used the internet to know how to get the dope from, and dope is be come unfavorable for a person. Like the person come be so wired to anyone because he doesnt know what hes doing. He be come a incorrigible person with anyone try to stop him. The people dont have to go to another one house. They just use the phone to call them and ask if they dont good. Because of the technology we dont have to see each other. They think its enough to talk in the phone or call each other video call. Before the technology everyone used to go see their family at home. Also they can go to the store and buy everything they want. After the technology they order everything online. When you play a games you dont talk to the other person that play with you. I think technology let you be come a unfavorable person. Reason we use technology for anything. Example you dont have to go to the bank to pay your credit bill you can sit and home and do it. You dont have to hold you debit card with you guess why because you can open it on your phone. Technology makes everything silly. Also you can pay your house bill when you sit at home. Technology has a positive effects too. For reason I can call my friends in Generic_City with my phone. I dont have to write a litter for them and send it to Generic_City. If someone sick and you dont have time to go visit her just call her, and ask if shes feel better at that time. Technology also can help you to make a new friends for any country. Technology is positive because when I came to USA I didnt speak English at the time. So when I went to school it was so hard for me to understand what are the people talking about. One teacher used Google translate to try to speak to me. That was nice of her shes tried to help me to understand whats going on in the class. She told to me to watch TV in English to try to learn how to speak, But to was hard for me because when I came to USA I was to old; and I was already speak one laughed.

535,3810,5DA3135B6664,"Ralph Waldo, Emerson, wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond hat you already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with Emerson statement these are my reaason why. First, i think if we do not prepare for more than one thing. We never will grow up. Second, have more than one knowledge than other people always will be advantage. Last, if we do not try more than one thing that can be more hard of that we already know. we never will grow. First reason,i think if the people do not prepare their lives with more than one knowledge. Their lives will be without direccion, and with less opportunies in our society, becuase they will do not have the enought knowledge to play a good job. For example, if they are looking to find better job with new experiencies that will be impossible to find for them, becuse they do not have the knowledge which one is require for the position. how they can be productive for the country or society. If they are not prepred to make done specific job that can be important. Second reason, when we have differents knowledge our lives help us a lot to find the best or easy jobs. The knowledge is the most power thing the human being can have in thier hands. Some people think the knowlege is something that we can not buy from any where. Exmple, if you focus to learn. you always will be have advantage to grow. Last, i think if the people never try something hard they never will grow. we always need to try something who will bring new experiences on our lives. Exmple, when someone is goint to university and the person graduated from teacher, but if he stuck there, and not go for more hard profession he never will grow like principal etc. Conclusion, i agree with Emerson statement, because he give to us expecific ideas what is life about when he said ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow. this is why i agree to his statement, and i provide all this reason.

I think soccer is a fun activity to play, because you can learn how to work in teams . In my opinion it helps you improve your friendly skills. Soccer helps you on how to work in teams. Ive seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they dont get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team. Also, when you play soccer you have to think what youre going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills. Most people are not good at thinking fast. It would be helpful for them to play soccer. It can help you think of new ideas. maybe in an emergency it might help you think faster on what to do. it can also help you develop new ideas. It makes you pick the best choices you have and what to do with them. Playing a sport its going to help you in the future, even if you think its not.

They just be in their house watching TV shows,playing video games, or just doing nothing. People focus too much on the internet that they forget how to play sports and do fun stuff.

Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when theyre in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me ""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them. So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when shes sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and sees her like that they say that shes wired from how she acts, but her first imression wast like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and were a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that shes very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how shes diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see peoples impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some ones mind when they see some one impressions for the first time. I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow peoples impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation. Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someones story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Peoples reactions might chang after an accident happen to some ones in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some ones reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible.

539,2880,BB430219DBB4,"In my opinion its not a good idea because in every country in world its role that student have to study 12 yeaer in the then have to go to college. There is some people in the world that they would like to graduate early because they dont like school the only reason they dont like the school is that they wake up early and they cant sleep. If we graduate on the time then we can do something to the country. its good if someone want to take courses because they will learn more things they will have more experiance. In the other countrys the rule in schools are every student have to study 12 years, 7 or 6 book in a book, 12 or 14 test two time in the year the one test is in the half year and the other test is in end of year. In other country after graduate every student of school have to take a big test for college or university in this test the score are start from 1 to 400 hundred the top score is 400 hundred if any one get the first position the president will gave him gift and some money also. The most university are 4 year but only docter have to study 7 years. Our response is that to tell the student who want graduate early that its not good to graduate early because you didnt learn anything you came to schools to learn something not for time pass. there is some student they are coming school for time pass they want to pass their time if you ask them a question they cant answer it for that reason we have to complete 4 year in high then graduate. If a student graduate early then college and university will hard for him because he didnt learn the thing that he need it in the college or univerrsity. Working in school time is not good for student, because he cant learn anything like in the morning he is coming to schools and after schools he is going to work and he is coming from work night and he sleep so when he will study if he didnt study he cant graduate. its rule that 18 year or over 18 have to work but someone is in the school and he is 18 its not to work his family have to support him to study. Its family responsibilty to tell his child to study. when he gradute then he have to work because he dosent have to study too much because collage is easy that school. I hope they change the rule that when student finish thire class and pass ESOL than the are graduate, because the student will take the class that they need it to finish high school and they only focuse on the ESOL and the class that they need if they didnt study the other subjects then why thay make the class they make the class to study and learn something for that reason they have to make a new rule.

Community service should be a job that the government should be giving to people who dont have jobs. Students should have their time in school and after school to learn and enjoy part of their life. Example, that of a person who comes back from school, tired and with a lot of homework to do. If he goes to do that service, he might not do all of his homework. And if he stays late to night to do it, he will not focus the next day. So that will hurt the student from both ways. As my position was stated to you to read, my advice to you is; at least help some students get our of this difficult service.

I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said, Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing. First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it. Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it.

Those people are probably really excited because maybe they finished there assingment or homework quickly. Another one is the afternoon people that come back from school or work there. Sometimes theres people that cant wait to go home and eat and see their family and just go to sleep after that. On the other hand theres some people that are so tired that they cant even drive or even talk to the person that theyve been picked up by. Ive seen it all from so many people.

548,2964,FE822B3E72FC,"On this time most the people had failures on their life, a failure is something that always gonna happen on the life. Some people get it on the good way and they make of each failure a lesson for their life , also a failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best , each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step Some people get the failures on good way when they learn about it. All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example. If your teacher give you 10 days to do a presentation on your computer and, the first day you say i will do it tomorrow and you say the same the next day until a night before the day that you have to turn the work you start do it , and you dont have enough time and you get a bad grade. The next day it was a failure and you will learn about it because the next time you will do it on time. A failure give to you the motivation that you need to do your best the next time. When you do something wrong for first time you feel bad and you want to do it wrong again , inclusively if it was a little mistake you dont want to and you got motivation. Most the people owners of big companies obtain motivation when they have a failure on a business, they dont give up they get motivation to do their best on the next business for example. You went to your work and its your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going. Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesnt, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for dont get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you dont gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault. Your coach gonna scold you for it but you gonna be alert for the next time and you also gonna be more stronger because you learn about of your mistake. The primer minister Winston Churchill had the reason when he said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" I think that if everyone doesnt have any failure on their life, they never know how hard can be a success person on this world. They never learn about their failure and maybe they dont encourage to the best on their jobs in conclusion all the people have more then one failure on their life but they make of it something good on their life.",5,5,6,5,5,5,3874,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
549,423,6D41FAC8F3CF,"The author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,"" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway. Im disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people. To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. thats why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they cant do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture. If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and dont peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work. The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say. The solution to this problem is do what you thing is right; and the comunty need to have a good relationship families,neightborhood, and students.

552,460,327F4BCC9E4B,"The idea that businesses have made is very important. Finding means to conserve energy and resources are important in our daily life. Most people use energy and resources in their day to day activities which put more pressure on the use of energy and resources. This four-day work week will conserve the workload on energy and resources. I agree to the fact that my school should follow the four-day school week with each day consisting of ten hours. When the school time is extended, it will make students have more time to do any unfinished assignments in a particular class. Students can do more work and cover many topics in a day. This will make teachers do a lot of work in a day. For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class. If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school. Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasnt considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage. In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

Students can get the same knowledge in school or in their house but easier. Bullying is the major problem in school;however, teachers can avoid bully by having the option of distance learning. Teenagers might be bad influence for other teenagers by forcing students to drink,smoke, or even worse to use drugs. The majority of students have responsibilities to take care of after school, taking other classes online,taking care of their siblings, or have a job. Even though teachers try to avoid bully, is hard to make sure students are well behave some do not listen at all and not care or some are lazy. Some students lives are tough for many reasons it can be by their parents that do not pay attention to them, stress by having too much school work, or some of them have already a job, and adding one more by bully, it can bring bad consequences. In many cases students suicide because of the stress, or they are tired of people not paying attention to them, and not care about what happens in their life. They are cases that teachers are aware of bully, but they ignore the fact that the school is not a save place to be anymore and that they are big problems going on at the school and having to deal with it is better than having to call their parents and do something about it. Teenagers do not realized the fact that they can be responsible for someones death and they be can put in jail by many years, and ruin their live by making fun of someone,or punching other students, it can be something silly and that little things can ruin their lives. Some students might be a bad influence for other students by forcing them to do several things that can bring consequences for the rest of their lives by being in jail,being unhealthy,or change their life in a bad way. In this days is normal or cool for a student to drink, smoke, use drugs and forcing other students to do the same. The ""if you do not do this I am not your friend no more"", or "" you do not love me if you do not this"" or even worse ""if you do not drink with me I am going to tell everyone your secrets"" that makes students be afraid of losing their friend, girlfriend/boyfriend forcing them to make actions that do not beneficial them at any pint of their lives. Teachers in high school are though to students; however, some students do not care about their education at all and they go to school to talk to a friend or distract other students effecting other students education. Some students are always energetic, getting in trouble all the time,distracting other students, being a bad influence, instead of giving them referrals or suspending them it can be recommend to do home school to avoid any type of problems. It is a good idea to start saving money for college/future and having a job. It is difficult to study or do homework while having a job students get stress and frustrated to have to attended to school and a job. School waste time in lunch or having other activity when students can do all their work in home and a few hours they are done and can take care of other responsibilities. In students houses can take their time and not have to rush in a assignment or in a test, having the opportunity to not get stress over school work. Having to wake up at the morning it is a hard thing to do for the majority of students, not having a good rest at night can effect students by ,grades, not concentrating, falling asleep at class, not paying attention,always been tired,or skipping some classes can effect when they graduate. In conclusion having the opportunity to do home school can make a big difference in a good way to the school and to the students education. That it is something that can be a easy way to learn and have the same knowledge like the other students, but in easier way. Internet have the access to many apps to help students can be a fun way to learn instead be sitting in a classroom for two hours. Students can avoid the fact that are some students that do not care at all and if they do not care about their live they are more possible not care about other student education.

This statement is false because you cant judge a person based on their appearance because sometimes people are just having a bad day and when you become friends with them you find out how that person actually is. For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you cant judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesnt determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change. In addition, when you become friends with someone and you talk with them, sometimes they tell you that when you met them, they werent having a good day.

Sometimes you have a bad impression of someone because of what other people say and the opinion you have on them do not change until you start talking to that person, I think that this an error that a lot of us make, we judge a person without knowing how they actually are.

My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them. Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosent have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I dont really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I dont think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt ll fit right in. I dont think ill have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and ive been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment. Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I cant do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place. In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosent look like it. I have played with my brother before but im always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i dont even know. Im not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops. Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I dont know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I dont know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. Thats why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades ive been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I cant. In the future I will just not now cause I cant jus try i cant say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. Im just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause ill also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully. I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i dont even know if ill be abke to accomplish it and make it. All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it. Never give up on big dreams like these. Everyone should try to make the best out of you.",6,6,7,8,6,6,2380,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Although some people say that technology have a negative effect on peoples lives because technology is making people to not socialize, actually technology helps the people to communicate with others that are far away and technology makes peoples lives easier. The people who said that technology has a negative effect on peoples lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media. However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls. Also, technology makes peoples lives easier because you can shop via internet, complete your work, and plan projects. Technology gives people an advantage to have an life without stress.

567,2566,579603CA894B,"Why is it important to learn from the experience of others? Well it could help you in the future to make a decision or to pick in between stuff. I think its really interesting to hear about other people back experiences. In overall if someone is trying to talk to you about their past experiences you should pay close attention because it could come handy in life. One of the reasons why its important to learn about others past experiences is because it could help you out in the future. For example if you encounter the same situation as them youll know what to do,in the other hand if you didnt pay attention to them and you face the same situation they did youll be clueless on what to do. If a friend is in trouble or he needs advice with something you could help them out because of others past experiences. Another reason why it could be important to listen to someones past experiences is so you dont make the same mistakes as them. When I was 8 years old my grandpa used to tell me that smoking wasnt good at all even tho he did it all the time,then my dad told me the same thing about smoking so Ill always know that smoking its not good for anyones health and I wont make the same mistake my grandpa did. In conclusion I think that listening to other peoples past experiences is good because it will help a lot in the future and itll help you make important decisions in life and you could even help other people when they are struggling.",8,7,7,8,8,7,1127,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
568,2643,D23D870D5333,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books,shop,and play games without speaking to another persons .Has the limitation of human contact due to the technology has positive or negative effects on peoples lives? I think this is negative, because the rate of oversize people will grow. People shouldnt spend most of there time on devices or inside. They should go out in the real world and see how things are. How nice people are to them . First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you wont meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun. They also meet people online and let what the people online think of them. that effects a lot of peoples lives. Then, teens would be on video games all day rather than go out and do something active. That will increase oversize teens and adults in America. Technology can take over someones life they can be hooked to it. That its self harms the brain all types of ways. Although, people are getting there things done without having to go and talk to other people. They can lose a lot of vitamin D. That can cause to death and in that way we would have a lot of deaths. and our population will decrease because of technology. In Conclusion, what the people are doing isnt right technology shouldnt keep us away from each other. we as people should stand up for each other. we should get out more and have a community picnic and be with each other.

569,1115,A3E6A572C6E5,"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they dont understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture. Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you dont even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Names family didnt understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesnt want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. Thats why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not. dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didnt let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up. ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In todays world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and thats where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you. Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Names mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Names mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and thats that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you dont have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didnt want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back. In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

571,3858,7797541CF0A6,"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it wont help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life. We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because its not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesnt matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess. Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because its not easy to learn english. Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesnt have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesnt matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didnt give up because of that. People have to know that doesnt matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesnt mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

574,1252,BA9DA5122C58,"I think that we should have after school homework clubs in school because it can really help kids get homework done at the right time so they dont get a zero on their homework. There is kids that get too much homework so homework club would be a good time for them to get their work done so fast that they dont need to worry about it when they get home. Some kids might struggle in one class because they have a lot of assignments that they need to make up. Homework club will give students plenty of time to get missing work done, and they should move the grade up to an A or B. You could also get homework from a bunch of different classes, and homework club will give them enough time to get the easy assignments done, so that they can focus on getting a hard assignment done, and that would leave the students with one assignment left to do. Homework club can be seen as a way to spend your time wisely when it comes to getting homework done. It reduces the stress of getting too much homework because students will realize how much time that they have to get their work done so they can focus on the activities that they do in or outside of school. For example, someone might have soccer practice at 5:30, and homework club might be from 2:30 to 4:50. That would give a student enough time to get a lot of work done before soccer practice. Its better to finish homework early because you would not need to worry about it for the rest of the week. Sometimes kids need assistance from teachers because they are struggling to understand the subject, and they may need a teachers help. The could stay at homework club so students can work with the teacher to get the work done. A student might leave an assignment at the last minute because they had other assignments to do. If homework club will give a student two hours in a half to do their assignment, they should be able to get their work done just in time. Homework club can give relief to a student when they have left an assignment at the last minute. I believe that if a lot of kids went to homework club, then all students will be successful. That would mean that kids will get As and Bs from now on, and they would not need to stress about their grades. It just takes students to use their time wisely at homework club to get homework done, and no one will have any problems.

575,947,6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they wont have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, dont have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home. A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids dont show their full attention in school because theyre not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, Im not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while im doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school. Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when theyre teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time. Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges. In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.

576,3484,EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that youve learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves. What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if Im studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student cant get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building ones character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.

Meeting a person with a bad attitude/ impression can show you that they are not good for you or even around the people that you hang out with, many people tend to have the impression of a cool and awesome person when in reality they arent that person, many people try to put up an image so people think that you are ""awesome"" or ""cool"". leaving someone with a bad impression can have a big or negative impact in their life for example when you first meet a person you wanna date they could leave you with a good impression but over time that person can change the way they feel about you and you see that a they are changing as person which many people arent comftarble with change of a person. also having a bad impression on the job you are trying to get, wont get you the job because of how you are behaving or using words or even body posture says a lot about a person.

Students think its a great idea to go to different businesses because it will be helpful to them in the future. If a student is stuck on what he wants to do in life the businesses can help them see what they want for their future. Students should have partnerships because students can get more skills about that job, students learn more about the job their going for, and student can see if that the job they really want to be in. First, students can get more skills about there job because they are in the business hands they can go around learning on how they do everything. They also get to see how the company is ran and how they handle business. Student can learn a lot we it comes to the business if the company shows them about it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Their going to want to go to the Tech center about it their going to want to learn more. Second, is that they learn more about the business by going to the company. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company. They will learn about the paper work over there. They will even know where they want to work at over there if they learn more about it. They will have a fun experience about their job they most likely want to do when they get older. They would be even more interested to take classes at school about business and will pursue in that type of employment . Third, students can really see if they want to be in that type of business. Similar to the other two this helps them, but not only if they want to pursue in that job its for if they really dont want the job. Also they can find a back up plan if that business is not the right one for them. They can go see if its a bad business, if it helps with the future, and if its the job they want to go after. They cant focus them to like if they didnt see it for themselves they wont do it if its not for them, theyre going to find something that they want to do not what they need to do. Students can see of they want to work there they can see the positive and the negative of the business they cant be focused, or they cant just cant be focused on that one thing. In conclusion, The students get to choose if they want to or not. They should know what they want to or figure out what they would do in the future. Students cant be focused to do mainly anything they have to find what they like for they can do it. Other people may say that they will go there and not learn anything,however if students go there for what they are a looking for they can pursue it. If students font get to choose then students wouldnt get more skill about the job, wouldnt learn as much about the job, and wouldntt even want to see the type of job.

Off this quote i feel that sometimes in life you can accomplish things with no effort but mostly, in life you gotta work hard to earn and get the things you deserve and have well accomplished in life. Another thing is that you gotta have a really good effort in life to get really far. I agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote on,"" how much maybe be done if we are always doing"" because thats how it has to be done in life , you gotta work for what you want and need, everything is earned in life and its way easier to get things that need to be done quicker by putting your effort and always working, than to just be standing or laying around doing nothing. One main reason i agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote is that you gotta work for what you get in life,you gotta always be doing something to get stuff done. Its an amazing quote that is used in a way that many dont think or have had the thought of. His quote is supporting the fact that it takes hard work and focusing to get work done and that work wont get done on its own. Another reason , is that no matter what you do , you always gotta work in life. To not take things for granted and actualy work and to not be lazy and get no work done that has to be done, done . Itll help out in the long run and make things easier in life by doing what you have to. Thomas Jeffersons qoute is there to incourage others to do great in life and do everything possible to get your goals achivied. This quote is a great figure of speech that can help out in the long run for people in need of it. One last reason i believe thomas jeffersons quote is a great and an amazing quote is that it justifys that life isnt easy and everything isnt free, also that things come with consequences. To also, not take things for granted and be grateful for what you got because thats the amount of effort you put in , instead of just laying down and or doing nothing at all. The quote has a alot of great reasons and thoughts that are put into peoples minds off this one quote it could help motivate someone in need of motivation. In conclussion, Thomas Jeffersons quote can help people that are in need of something to motivate them. To help them by telling them that its fasinating to see what you get out of completing your work by always doing something. Lastly, how easily it is to complete something by moving around and not just sitting and down absolute nothing about your work.

My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that.

So the Teacher report to the Principal and notice the score are very low. They have to find a way to make there student successful, so they had a meeting and suggest that Student should do there assignment at home they called Home School. Home school is a program to allow Student to do there homework, quizzes, assignments, and tests. This program help the Student to become successful, Student give there thought about home school and they say is more easy then School. What good about home School that you can stay at Home, eat your lunch watch T.V, and you will still have time to do your assignment on time. But some other Student didnt want to be home school because they feel them self bored in home. They dont get to make friends, they need help with their assignments, They wont get the information they need. Student often get Home School because they probably dont have schools in there location but Parents want the best for there kids to have a good education so they gotta do whatever it takes to have there kids to become successful in the future. If I was in the position or suggestion on the issue I would let the Student know to should take regular school.

591,1119,20BC5CCE8C64,"""SNORE, SNORE"" every time that I do something I do not I feel so lazy. I think if we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that your mind do not get lazy and you feel productive. For example, if you go to school, have a job, and help other people. If you do many things every time later on you always will want to do something. I also know that you can do something without doing nothing and one them is been at of problems. Like Thomas Jefferson wrote,"" never to be idle"" that means that do not be the type of people that do not like to do nothing. First, I believe if you go to school you will accomplish more because your mind is going to be busy. In my opinion, I feel that I do a lot more than just not do nothing because: I wake up on time ,I go to school every day, I do my homewoks after school, and I feel productive by going to school. Also when I do not understand something I ask the teacher for help and if my classmate need my help I do my best by giving them information about the class. If I keep my mind busy I feel good because I experience talking with my classmate. Second, having a job help you by giving you experience for the future. For example, when I started working In my first job I learned a lot things like how to use a computer, I though that I was never going to learn it but I did it and now it help me for my education. Next, now I know that the way of accomplish something you need to have interest to do it. If you do not have interest or if you want to do nothing you never are going to accomplish anything because the best way of do it is by doing something. In my second job I did not know how to use a cellphone but I put all my interest to learned and help my customers by taking their orders. Now in my third job I know many things like : answer the phone, take orders, and especially how give a good customer service. Third, I think helping other people is way of accomplish something. If you help people like homeless you are going to have the opportunity to talk to them and understand why they do not have a place to live or a family to support them. I think this is the best way because some people prefer to leave their home because they do not like the rulers of their parents. This is not the best solution that people should take because everyone need a support of someone. And the best way of accomplish something no matter what it is is by obey and listen the old people who always have the right because they have more experience than us. For example, one day I was homeless because my parents left me with my two brothers and I did not have food to give to them every time that they asked for food my eyes were tearful because they were little and also they did not understand the situation. Now when I see people asking for food it remain me that one day I was like them. I chose to write about we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that you accomplish a lot of things by always doing something and I said by going to school, find a job, and helping other people. I believe t I also know that you can accomplish other things by doing something different but I chose help my self and others. Also I understand that you can accomplish something by doing nothing but one of then is by been at of problems. By doing all of this I considerate my self accomplishing many things.",7,6,7,5,6,6,434,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
592,361,E770240CAEE1,"The first impression that is impossible to change,is surpise.

Then, I want to change the work,because I tired of the chefs,fire,bad manager or bad pay, and I can look for another job. Now I start again,because I take a different job like a Secretary.

So this is the Surprise,the life change all the time,but we need to have positive attitude and face up to all the bad things that coming. Is the same with the school, some times the attitude change,because is impossible that somebody knows all the information about one class or two. We have differents impressions impossible to change. Because some people hate some class, for example math, but some liked. Normally I hate this class, because is just number,equations,square rules. I disagree with this class, but I know that in the future I need. But all we have differents positions, because some people love the numbers and others love another class for example, I like History why. The reason is that I like learn new things that I dont know, is very interesting. But, I agree with one thing, all the class are very important for my life, because in the future I can take any job because I know differents things for differents carrers and I can help to other people in any class.

594,1363,FC2050EA9039,"The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you dont believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It cant hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesnt make sense to try and understand a concept that wont make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I cant grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why its not possible to master difficult problems. Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because its not so much a person cant grow but dont have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.

However, when they need to turn the work and they are stuck in problem they can not find teacher to help them, or the device has broken, so students they can not turn the work. Although some people think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, it is actually true that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because there are no teacher for help them and some students they do not have internet at home. When the students find a problem they will need teacher for help them to turn the work before the deadline.

596,2582,545E9BF477C1,the reason i think that we should not have more school time is because some people in school would not be able to keep up with other kids. and most kids get ttired of being in school for six hours imagine being in school for longer then that and even more kids would start going to sleep in school. because they are already tired of all the classes during the day. with another good reason that i disagree with adding more time in school is because some people have to do things after school like take care of family or go somewhere important and if you added more time then they would not be able to do get this stuff done because they would be stuck in school learning longer then the time they are accually supposed to get out. i belaive that there should not add more time to school because it would also be a waste of time because teachers would have to do even more stuff done buy more stuff for students and get more work done grade more papers because we would have a longer school time and then the teachers would have to write more speak more and do stuff more then they would if we had only six hours in a day. with another reason that i dont thing school should not be longer is that it would not only affect the students and the teachers but it would affect everyone because then the whole school board would have to do more work and the school would loose a lot of money because the school board would have to buy more stuff for students and get more things that kids would need to get everything set up good for the students. with another good reason we should not have longer school cause if we had longer time kids would not be able to handle so much because they would be learning so many thing in one day and then it would confuse them and when they are going to take a test they would be confused because they were pressured to learn so much in a short period of time and they would not like that because they might fail. ,8,5,7,6,7,6,1099,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 8"

598,23,2DAA07621328,"Technology is taking the must attention than the comunicacion with other peolpe. Technology allows to complete many task without having contact with other people. Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on peoples lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person. In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people dont talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you dont have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person. Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you dont have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it. Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesnt have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games. To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives. True technology is the future of the world but keep it in main how you can use the technology and the technology dont use you.

599,403,9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think its bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they dont want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them. In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people dont go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they dont know who they are. Some of these people might say that theres no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, theres a risk when you talk to this people online and its the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what theyre doing, and thats how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we dont know if its real. When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they dont want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time wont help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didnt have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now dont want to get out where technology is at. Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, its hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them. Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we dont control the use of technology.",7,6,7,6,5,6,2081,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Generic_Name friend also knew that being a nurse would not help Generic_Name so he decided to tell him the truth.``Generic_Name maybe your parents are right."", He said.`` Isnt nurse a good job too?,"" Generic_Name asked.``It is , Its just that being a nurse is no good for you and your parents,"" He said.``Why,"" Asked Generic_Name .``Because it doesnt have enough money for you and your parents,"" He said. When Generic_Name went home ,he started thinking maybe his friend was right . He took a lot of time thinking about it. So he decided to be a soldier. At first he didnt want a soldier then he thought about it and he decided to go to soldier school. When he was graduated he went to collage. He worked really hard. When he finished his school,he employed for the soldier work. The first thing they did they buy a new house for him. When he started to work there he didnt have any problems .He felt like his dreams came true. He never had any money problems. And he also had enough money to help his parent. His parent were really proud of their son and happy for him. From there on he didnt have any money problems . In addition The one type of job I would employ would be a soldier because I want to protect people in the country. Once there was a girl named Generic_Name .Generic_Name lived with his father and mother but she didnt have any siblings. Generic_Name Generic_Name s father was a soldier .Generic_Name really loved being a soldier but her parent didnt let her be because in their country girls werent allowed to fight on wars. One day a soldier came to Generic_Name s home and told Generic_Names father that there was war in their town so they needed him. But Generic_Name father couldnt go because he was really sick .And the problem was he only had one child and she was girl. Generic_Names father wanted to go but Generic_Name stopped him because he was very sick and she didnt want her father to die and she also didnt want their town to be destroyed Generic_Name decided to go to fight by her self . When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her fathers house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl shes a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back. One day the enemies surrounded the soldiers and they were all attacked. The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didnt have any one to protect them .Generic_Name dint want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said hes waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didnt saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didnt have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her . One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did. At first Generic_Name thought that being a nurse was the right thing for him but when he stepped to soldier he didnt have any problems about money and his poor family now lives good life because of their child is a soldier. At first the general though that girls can not help on the war but Generic_Name wanted to prove it and she proved that women too are strong enough to be soldiers. Dear Manager I would like to employ for soldier because it is a good way to protect other people and it has a lot of money.

If school wouldve ended at the normal time he couldve went to pick up his grandma. Even though staying an hour more would help students more, there wont be anytime left for after school activities. in the winter time it gets dark fast and some kids like to go outside and play for a while after school,but if they add that extra half an hour kids would have to get home fast and leave there stuff to go outside for a little bit. There are many bad reason why adding another hour to school is a bad idea but, there are many good ones too like a good reason would be kids can catch up on there missing work, a bad idea is kids go home later then they used to and some parents would not like that. If they do add an hour of school they should open the school at 8:30 instead of 7. If we come at 8 kids would get more sleep and not fall asleep in class with more sleep kids have more energy and with ms are more energy kids are more productive.

With the use of technology daily affect peoples vision, with the time people use glasses. Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversations with their friends. People use to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them.

603,3116,65CC82C9B3C9,"I I agree because people should have more time to rest mostly because the effect of the stress and the health of their body. Schools should be the same, they could have more time to do their homework and rest, because there is stress in children. In the majority of middle schoolers and high schoolers there is always stress and preoccupations about grades. Most of high school teenagers stress and worry about colleges if they got in or not. And by taking the four-day weekend we are reserving energy and resources, by not driving cars or motorcycles because of the toxic smoke a vehicle throws to the air we breath. Sometimes some of the big businesses become of abusive or peoples hours to get extra work done. It should be peoples decision if they want to stay extra hours if they want to get their work done. People work to live and not live to work they somehow got to look for ways to provide themselves and sometimes their families. If they were to finish their jobs with everything done , they get to go home and be with their families. Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it. People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work. In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldnt worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.",8,8,8,8,8,6,1329,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
604,2583,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now. First, it doesnt matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I dont think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i dont think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself."" Second, I dont think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and dont you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter. I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller. Dont you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could ive been taller by now. I dont like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right. So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples. This goes to the person that readys my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life.

605,239,EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings. One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes. Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time its going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them dont have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life. The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time. In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",8,6,8,7,6,7,3438,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

608,1246,7CB712FD1253,There are some some schools that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some schools that are still doing Traditional ways of the 4 years of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion Its a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because thats hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometimes stay because they fell behind and sometimes its because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 years of high school are the truly advanced ones because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them. if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some jobs just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now theyre working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else In the case that going to college after graduating the three years are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now theyre working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the things everyone wants and its good to have a goal in mind. In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because Its working smarter not harder and thats the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.,8,7,8,7,7,6,1642,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Ordering food online its a normal thing nowadays, people rarely go out to eat because of the food service, this is keeping humanity from doing any physical activity but its way easier to get something done. This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but thats also keeping them from playing outside.

611,2444,9C3D2911E32D,"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family. However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea. In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer. Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble. Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship. In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Lets make the adoption of curfews come true!

612,1486,C5B351564A3F,"According to this prompt can you imagine that some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to conserve energy and resource. However, now did you ask to your self, should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours?. went i think in that i give me some thing. although, follow this model by extending the school day two hours have benefists and disadvantages of follow this model to a four day of school week . fist, think about benifist that is very important part for students and for the employees , however consider how this model is going to help students and employees from school. Then how this model is going to help the school if they dont conserve energy and resourse. For instance, teachers are affected in how they give students work when they need some proyect to do how they use energy if they dont have resources. Now left think about if school dont have resourses how students use the restroom if dont have water, students also use water to get a shower went they have a game in the school, another think is that women in the kitchen they need water for cook and give students lounch. However, some students work after school and teachers needs to take care their childres after school or some teachers live very far. Beside, they could affect school education. Lastly, school are affected for many manner this affect whith the hours being to a four day school week in the other hand, let meask abouth disadvantages. Second, students,teachers and employes are affected in the disadvantages. For example, some students work after school if students wants to stay after school maybe they lost their jobs because they dont present to his work or if they have some homework to do after school they can no stay because they need to work studens are affected. Beside, teachers are affected too because after school they need to take care they childrens or maybe some teachers live very far and spend many time for arive to his home. In the other hand, school employes lost his work because if school work only four day at week the drive lost some hours of job this affect some employes and their families. Thats why this dissadvantages affect studens work and students education because some students dont came to the school if they are resposable with his job. However in my case this affect me because i work after school and i need came to the school too but i need some money. They are many reasons why this disadvantages affect students and employees. Let me ask some benefist that is good. Finally should fallow this model by stending four day school week you should have some benefist. For example, you should have one day off to stay at home with family, do the homeworks that the teaches give you or spedn more time to study, teachers can relax one day or maybe they prepare students assignment. In conclution, to conserve energy and resource to considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week, many pleople are affected mostly students and teachers because two hours would affect students job, also the teachers because some teaches live so far from the school and they dont have time to past with his family. In the other hand, the good thing is that they should have one day off and they can relax, students can do their homewors and they can study for his test or maybe they can go to his job in the day off. But is important can to the school every day because we need to learn more every day and in the future can take a better job we can do a good people and a good example for our family.

First of all some of the students have little brothers and sisters and the parents work and they dont have the chance to pick up they kids because they get out of the work late, so the orders sibling haves to take care of they little brothers and sisters also little kids from elementary schools cant get out of the bus without someone picking them up, so the older siblings have to pick them up or else the little kids are going back to school and they get scared because they are the only one who are in the school and they are little so they dont know whats going on so that is one reason why we cant be in school more hours not even half of a hour. Secondly students have to help they parents with the house how i said parents came from work late and they dont have time for nothing so students have to help them by cleaning the house, cook for they sibling and parents , they have to wash the dishes, wash they clothes, clean the rooms, some of the students have dogs and they have to go with them for a walk or take them to the doctor so when parents get home they can lay down and chill because they work really hard and all the students can do is helping doing the cleaning that is the second reason why we cant be at school more than we supposed to be. Finally some students have another type of activities after school like dancing, soccer practice and soccer games, basketball practice and basketball games, step teams, community service, etc also that helps a lot to get your mind out of thinking about homeworks, tests, classwork, so you dont stress out a lot because being honest sometime students have a lot of homework and test to do in each class and after school is the only time where you can get your mind out of school and also we are having fun for a little time because some parents are kind off strict and they dont let they kids to be outside after 8:30. In conclusion we cant be in school more than 8 hours because all the students have more activities to do and have fun for a little time and we have responsibilities at home helping parents cleaning and taking care and picking up little siblings and we can stress out a lot if we spend more than 8 hours in school because that means more work to do and we would be only student and we would be tired because also we are not going to have time to chill and i know that no one is going to be happy about it because teachers have they children as well parents need the help of they kids and students need they own time so these are my reasons of why I disaree of adding a hour and half of a hour.

I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals and also they have more experience about life.

616,179,D001F6D3A0D0,"Everybody would like to be succesful in the life, and thats possible, but is not easy you have to try one time and one more time until you have what you want; it doesnt matter how many times you try for it. In my opinion there are a lot of people that if they fail one time they give up and shouldnt be like that because you will be happy if you complete your goal, you will be a good example to help others to be successful, you can earn more than you expected. Complete your goal can be really important for you, and will make you happy, for example, my Mom wanted to have a beauty salon, but she knew that it wouldnt be easy; she started with a small room and a few customers, sometimes she didnt have custumers, and that made her think to close the beaty salon, but she never gave up, now she has a big room with a lot of customers; she is happy because she is doing what she likes, and the most important part she never give up. That is why we have to try many times until we are happy for what we have or what we are doing. Some people would like to have an example to make their goals, and you can be a good example if you don,t give up at firts time that you fail, for example, I have a cousin, Generic_Name, she was a bad student; she didnt care about her grades, tests, homeworks, and nothing about the schools. when I moved to live with her, she saw my grades and all that things that I do. She stared to ask me how I can have good grades in the tests and be successful, and I said to her,"" you need to have more enthusiasm for the school"" ,and now she has a really good grades and she is going to graduate this year. If we dont stop even if we fail, we can hel others to be successful. Some people might say that you lost the time trying something many times, however, you can earn more than you expect if you try as much as you can, for example, I saw a video on facebook; there was a man that was loking for a job to support his family; he went to many places, but nobody gave him a job. One time he was walking on the street, and he saw a man trying to fix his car, and without thinking he went to help the other man after that the man was thankful for the help, and he offered a job for the man. The man who was without job; he didnt know that he will get a job on that situation, what would happend if the man would be sleeping in his house; he would never get that job. That is why we never have to lose the enthusiasm to be successful; we never know what is prepared for us. It is clear that you will feel good if you complete your goals, and you will be a good example of persistence to help others to be successful, you will earn more than you expect if dont give up at the first time that you fail, and maybe is not easy, but you have your whole life to make it happen, and nobody will tell you when to stop; it doesnt matter how many times you try or you fail. The most important part is that you will be successful if you are constant and and what you are doing. ",6,6,8,7,7,5,2867,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

618,3536,B543953F757A,"When I think about and enjoyable activity, I think about sports, and the reason why its because a lot of people find sports as a fun way to be healthy and make them feel better of them self by being physically active, I also believe that any sport is a good example to learn from others as well as your self, and for I know sports is not all of just about competing against other teams and winning or loosing, is very helpful if were talking of team work. One of the most enjoyable activities in the world its sports, in some way many different kind of sports have proof that its a really entertainment thing to do and to be as much healthy then doing a diet from a doctors recommendation, people actually agree that if theres something that might have a plethora of fun and includes a reason to be healthy in daily life its sports,a 78 % of people in planet Earth consider and invited people to joying a sport for the good of others and good of your self too. Sport its a specific activity that in cases have help people feel better about who they are, how they look, and the way it has change people globally, most of the time a person doesnt know what they like to do even thought they try other stuff like being smart, video games, music etc, they feel like they dont belong or fit in something, but at the end they go along about what other friends says about sports and find them self the right place to be. Sports as a good educational activity example of learning about others as learning from your self, is very important when getting a job that consist in the statement of knowing other people, like being a teacher, a teacher doesnt get a job without presenting him/her in general to his/her teachers partner, or teach a class without presenting to the students in classes theyll be taking, they will also ask a new student to present him/her self to every one in the classroom,teachers mostly do with their classroom as a coach will do with his team in a sport. These two educational activities are alike to each other in the simple reasons that they both teach their learners to get to know each other and get along with one another, another way that theyre alike is that theyre preparing them for the big challenges, a English teacher prepared the students for the big writing SOL as a soccer coach prepared the players for the final game of the season. However its not only learning from others, many times sports definitely let you learn more about yourself, it takes out the person who you truly are it will also take all those stuff that you had no idea you new, doing sports can have experiences in which youll learn from. Team work is the hard work that a group does together to complete their goal, its not about the leader or the best member of the group, what most matter in team work is work as a group no matter the worst or best you do. If you ever play a sport you might know that the main thing to do is team work, for example football,if one of the football players has the ball, he cant go across the field and do a touch down if his team mates dont do anything to stop the defenders of the other team that wants to knock him out,but if they decided to play the game by doing team work he would of made a touch down because hes team mates would of help him pass through by knocking the defenders. Sports team around the whole world has a immense number of followers, followers keep on touch with them because they have something relative to it or because they had won a lot of times,and this is thanks to the strategy they do ( team work ), In conclusion sports are not only of competing against others, is something that is productive in the way that you dont only get a metal or a good job, sports are also to have fun with friend or even with people you dont know, and its a really good way of being healthy and be able to do two things at the same time, it also help us understand other people that needs it as you do with your team mates by knowing them and getting along with them, in sports you can learn from your self when you make a mistake, and finally in any kind of sport you will have to know how to play as team work because thats what matters in teams. There is a lot of other educational an enjoyable tings to do but I think sports are one of the best ones.",4,4,6,5,5,6,2439,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
619,2363,D10BBD82D66F,"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchills words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success. Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success. Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve. Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve. Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it. Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",7,7,8,7,6,6,2885,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
620,476,D45A0B7F9D48,"A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective. There are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful. Students should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didnt like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they dont participate,or turn in assignments. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected. In addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate. As you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy.

622,408,F7DF6ABE8573,"I strongly believe that technology is positive on human life because of all the effects it had on us in the past and present. Such as: technological advancements, you can talk to people easier, caused scientific break throughs which made us go further in life, and it also gave us security or protection. The technological advancements are practically everywhere because everything we use is technology. It has helped us with new vehicles that could possibly be more fuel efficient and possible will create more safety in the cars since its easy to hurt someone in a crash. It helped us in school and made us understand things such as looking up answers you dont know or checking when the next test is. It inspires people to think of other ways we can advance our technology state currently. Its really easy to talk to people because it doesnt take that much effort in order to have a conversation. The news is one example because it tells us whats happening even if they are far away from us, we can still hear them. The weather could change into a disaster and they would tell us to evacuate. It allows us to talk to relatives that live in other areas or countries. It could let us see political debates and see whats happening in other areas. Without technology we wouldnt have had any scientific break throughs because it moslty helped us with everything in life. An example of this would be us landing on the moon which is a important day for the people because it showed that we could do really big things. If people did not take the time to study and think about the different scenarios then we would not have those outcomes. It helps us by looking up something we dont understand on the internet and in five seconds you could finally understand whatever you were trying to look up. One thing that makes us feel safe would be your own home but what if someone broke in and had bad intentions. There would be an alarm system that would ring and call the police to indicate that there was a intruder. It gives us security by giving us locks on important things such as banks so no one can enter it unless they knew your password or any other necessity. Technology definitely played a huge role in our daily life and the evidence shows because everything we do involves technology or is something about technology. I strongly believe that technology doesnt stop human interaction but helps builds it up. I think this because we can text friends, text family, work on a project, or do school related stuff with it. If we keep on making up better technology or improve it then I believe it will make discover or invent big things that will push us into the future.",9,9,8,9,9,9,3715,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

Maybe that person has already tried the thing you wanna try he can give you his opinion on the item. If you wanna buy something first its good to talk to someone who has bought the item they can tell you if it works or not. Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesnt work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car. Or if you wanna buy some medicen you have to ask first before you drink the medicen or else you can even die from it if its bad for you.

And you always have to be positive when people give you advice even you know they arent saying things right they are just trying to help you. Its always good to give your opinion on things because maybe they arent sure if they wanna buy the item or not. If you care about a person your going to give your advice to a person because they are some how confused on something you can help them. Giving advice is a way to be nice because you wanna prevent from that person to buy that item if they buy it and it doesnt work they are just going to waste money on the item. Also by giving advice you can prevent people from getting hurt like if a guy walks to a store and buys something and it doesnt work he is going to come back to the store and fight the guy the sold him the item and then they both go to jail from fighting.

Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving. Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work.

Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding. Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them.

629,3066,9DDBBA28EBD0,"I agree with Michelangelos words, because some time when we whant to do things we start a low level because we think we arent not good enough to do it, even known that we can do it good. And you think others have more opportunitties to have success and you would not have any of them, and it only matter how fast you can learn and how good you do them. One good example of it could be sports and I have had a time when something like that happened to me. These happened when I was at my last school Generic_School, I knew that the practices to try out for the teams were going to start in 2 days. And I thought about that I could make it to play with which ever one, but when one of my friends told me that a lot of students were going to try out. When he told me that I thought that wasent good enough and that others could be a lot better than me, so I decided to not try out and I was already playing for one team of Generic_City and they told that if I whant it I could play for both and I answered no. I didnt accept to play with my school and next year I did the try outs just to see if at least I have a good level compared to others and the coach saw how I played and he put my on Varsity team. I played almost all games I got a record, and I archieve one goal that was to proved to me that I could play at a high level even knowing that a year before I was scare to try out. Another reason Its that really frecuently that people got scared to try a challenge, and to show themself that they can do thing at a higher level than what they think. A similar expample is one of my cousins knew how to work in construction in El Salvador and he was really good at it, and when he just got here in US he knew that there was contruction sites and places that he could work on it. First he told me that we was excited and that he would get one of those joobs and somehow the next day he told me that he wasent getting it any more. That was not inetersted any more and told that he didnt have enough skills and it was going to be to hard for him. I told him that yes It was going to be hard but he had a lots of skills and knowleage about it and it would take less time for him to learn what they do there. He said he was going to think about it and after a time he got the joob and it olny took him less than a month to know how they operated there and got hired more fast than others, because he was doing a good joob on everything that he has to do. He told me that he was happy to take that joob and first he was wrong when he said that he had not enought skills for that joob. Also another reason of why I agree with Michelangelo is that I remenber that around 3 and the hallf years ago I played soccer just with friends afterschool and we played just for fun and to relax. I didint whant it to play for a team because I felt that I was not to good to play for them. One day I was playing soccer afterschool with some friends, and one of my friends dad was a coach for a team of Generic_City and remenbered that he said to all of us that if we whant it to play for him in his team. All my friend got in the team and I was the only one that did not got in, because I felt that I wasent good enought so i decided to not join the team. And for the next season he was loking for a goalkeeper and I accept it to got in because my friends convinced me to join. After I going and play my first games I sorprise my self and the team to cause I was playing a really good level and we won the league that season. For next season I got a record that was not receiving any goals in 10 games and that lead me to win the best goalkeeper in that season. And at the beggining of my third season our captain left ,and I got surprised that all all in the team want it me as a captain and my coach said that I was the captain of the teamI just got really happy. And won the league and the All Starts tournament that year and since there I have played like 8 season because every year there are 2. I have won for my third year in a row the best goalkeeper in the league. First no one was interested on my and after some seasons almost all team in Generic_City teams whant it me and teams from Generic_City I had like 7 teams that whant it me to play with them. In conclusion I strongly agree with Michelangelos words, its really common that the worst danger for most of us is to set our aim too low and achieving less than what we can do, I have had some reason and example but in all of them I realise that if I work hard I can accomplish more than I think I deserve.",6,6,7,6,5,5,2102,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
630,2380,D9469EFAE287,"Im going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go some where, on this days the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased, you can use or have your own car or you, can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like. So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions. Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too, When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen; years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",7,6,7,7,6,6,3040,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

633,1235,B03AB7243AE5,"Millions of kids graduated last year when taking the program for early graduation, this program helps student to only take three years in high school. Most of the parents, students, and the teachers like to see students graduate early in high school, and this programs are mostly in the U.S.A. Student who graduated early will have a lot of opportunity to finish school and have a better life, most summer school lesson can also help students to take less classes at school. It is a good idea for student to take only three classes in high school in order to graduate and go to college, back those days my mom use to tell me a story, about the opportunities we have in we that most people dont really care about. She used to tell me a story about her in high school, how hard it is to graduate, most people can take five to six years in order to graduate and go to college. And most people did- en make it to college, cause they dont have the money to pay and it really hard to find a job in Africa. Student drop out of school just because they dont have the opportunity we have right now to graduate in high school. Most people will say it like this, ""Genius without education is like silver and mine"". People are brave, strong, smart, last learning, and well educated but they just dont use it and decided to let it go. This mostly happened to people who have the opportunity to do the right things but decided to let it go, and my gran mother use to tell me a story. If you ready to help yourself, God will be ready to help you, if you not trying to help yourself, God will not going to help you. All this opportunity we have are all helpful in many ways, taking three years in high school is very help full for most of the students, reasons why graduation early in high school is better than waiting for four years are. first reason, the three years of high school helps student to graduate early and move on to the next level, helps student to finish school early and have a better life. Second reason, helps students learn faster and makes it easier for college, it also helps student to take less classes in high school. the last but not the least, summer school programs can help students understand better and easier than normal classes because, less distraction from other students and having opportunities to ask questions you dont understand.

Some people might say that taking classes at home cant benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there ,taking classes at home can benefit students because their can have more time to sleep and their dont need to take a bus or walk. In the first place ,attend classes at home cant benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there. For example , I have a cousin who take classes at home but he never know anything because no body can help him when he have a question. While, always I tell him that if he have a problem I can help him or another option is that he dont taking classes at home anymore. Also he dont make friends because he do not go to the schools. I choose this option because a lot of student waste their time taking classes at home. I am agree that attend classes at home not have benefit. likewise, attend classes at home can benefit students because their can sleep more. In my case, if a have the opportunity to take classes at home im happy because I love sleep a lot. For example,the twenty-five of the student get classes at home because dont like to make a friends or their believe that their can do the work along. The classes start early so in this way they do not have to wake up early. Also, if people sleep more their can be more healthy this is the reason because student like to take classes at home to be more healthy. I choose this option because is important remember that many students want to sleep more or get extra time because their have a job and is hard to them do two thing at the same time .For this reason many student choose take classes at home. In addition,attend classes at home can benefit because student dont need to take bus or walk. For example,some student do not have to take bus because are more near to the school. In my case, I have to walk from my home to my schools sixteenth minutes every single day. when winter come and is so cold outside its not good to walk in this temperature. while , this is the reason because students take classes at home although sometime cant benefit. Another reasons is that some students have to take the public buses so is take classes at home dont have to take bus. I choose this reason because many people forget that many time is not easy for the students do that. Finally,everything have advantage and disadvantage because some schools think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and some schools are disagree. Also some students work a lot so their can benefit with this opportunity. Although, attend classes at home is not the same thing like go to schools and receive help from teachers, students, etc. In addition, if some schools offer this opportunity have to think about it and look the best option.",6,5,6,6,5,6,2304,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
635,1216,C51C5EA029D6,"There are many other ways, how we can choose our character traits. The first way is to choose our own character traits, by picking it for ourself. The second way is our character formed by influences beyond our control, by not being able to control it. The most reasonable character trait would be choosing our own character trails, because it makes the most sence out of all and most of the population can control on their emotions. There are different types of character traits, for example funny, exiciting, joyful, and many more. Our character traits are formed by our own influence and by our own actions. Thats what causes them to react from different types of emotions. For the most part, we are able to control our emotions, but sometimes we cannot control over them so they go out of control. Character traits can be used in many different ways. However, there are some character traits that we cant control, it would happened to us by itself because we sometimes dont have control on ourself. For example anger, sadness, and depression are the reasons why we lose control sometimes because we are unable to control over it. These emotions can be dangerous once you are out of control, you dont even know what you will be doing, it could be something really terrible. Thats the reason character traits can be good or bad sometimes. Some people support the fact to pick there character traits for themself, some think its not in our control and we are unable to control it. The people that said they decide to choose the character traits for themself, say when they do something they can feel the emotions in contol of them and do what best fits them. On the other hand, the people that think the charater traits is not in there control, say if they are working or doing anything the emotions of them just happens and they cant control it. In most of the cases it is caused by the bad emotions like being mad, or sad and more. There are many more reasons of people talking about character traits. Not all of them are good nor not all of them are bad. It mainly depends on the person who is controling it. For the people that are unable to do so can control over it by doing couple simple things and not letting there emotions take over them.

Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldnt make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our lifes.

637,186,AB9527C4A312,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peopless lives. Humans use the technology for some differents things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. Also,the people dont need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. technology make all more easy than can be. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples: Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they dont need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they dont use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people dont work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people. Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they dont need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people dont had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they dont care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use. Technology can change the way of people live and think. for example. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation. Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you cant communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and dont want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.",5,5,7,4,4,6,2299,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
638,2467,97C6E22BA8EE,"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;thats why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy. Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals. Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life. There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions. Concluding with paragraph one,two and three, working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,that is gonna be your legacy,. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.

I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours dont hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we cant give the workers that break because the company doesnt have enough people to cover that person. Thats why Im willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire. Finally, Im a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph Im willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me Ill do it at the best of my ability, it doesnt matter what it is Ill do it.

Students need to be flexible for new things and face in the best way. Like if you find difficult in one of your class you should ask your teacher for help. Student need to be flexible because if they take class in the evening or online is going to be different and maybe difficult for them but they need to be able to find a way to be successful. Is good for student to graduate early from high school. Yes is good if they feel they can do it and pass everything what they need to pass.

They think that he meant that it doesnt matter who did it, that the thing that matters is the example. In my case, Albert Schweitzer was right on his quote. Although many people say that there are better ways to influence others than just with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples, actually the best way to influence others is setting a good example on your own behavior because it shows that you were capable of doing it no matter how hard it was for you and yet you still did it and also you will inspire other people to do their own example based on your ideas. Some people say that there are better ways to influence others because than with your own experience because there are famous people with more interesting examples. Meaning that you have to be someone important in order to influence others. They say that intelligence is another way to influence others because if youre not smart you wont make a good example for others to follow. In conclusion they say that you have to be a skilled and important person to have a huge influence on others. Actually, the best way to influence other is not being someone important in society but setting a good example on your own behavior. It will show that that even though it was hard for you to do your example, in the end you still did it. That show that no matter who you are or where you come from as long as you have determination you will achieve your goals. Look at Barack Obama for example, hes a black man and yet he still managed to become president of the United States. That really had a huge impact in the black community and inspired many of them to work hard for their goals. Also, you will inspire other people based on your own ideas. An article on New York Times shows that most of the people based their ideas on other peoples examples, which means that if you continue working hard to achieve your goals you will appear on one of those articles and will inspire others. Think about it, wouldnt you like to hear that one person gave you credits because became successful because he read about your experience and he based his ideas on that experience of yours? In conclusion, many people will say that in order to influence others you need to become somebody important, but you know what? That doesnt matter! As long as you have determination and great creativity you will achieve your goals and will inspire many people to follow their dreams no matter how much it will cost them. Like Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" It doesnt matter what people say, the one that has the power to inspire others is you!

645,535,72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school. Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, Its a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students wont do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they wont do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. Thats my first reason why we shouldnt attend school from home. My second reason why students shouldnt attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that theres no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isnt any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. Thats my second reason why we shouldnt attend school from home. My final reason why students shuldnt attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students dont attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they dont do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. Thats my final reason why students shouldnt attend classes from home. In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless theres a sicknees happening throughout the world and its making school to shut down and do online classes.

For people that like to do what they do they have some stuff that make them feel acomplishwith what they do for example: The space are were they work at. The relation ship that they have with other workers to work together . How hard is the job that they are doing that makes them feel comfrontable.

647,2804,6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over anothers person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are. I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other persons personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media. Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow. I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone elses life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion peoples actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do.

648,3092,BEE04EB31D59,"What is the best leaning environment? Working in groups or working alone? Some people like to work in groups and others like to work alone. Many people have their ways of learning certain things. Some may like working in groups because it makes the work easier, bring up their confidence and social life. Others may like working alone because it helps people concentrate, they like to get their work done faster and they dont feel uncomfortable towards other people. First, Working in groups might make the work easier, help bring up their confidence, or their social life. It can make their work easier by separating the work to make it faster to deal with the work. It can help bring their confidence by talking to other people. It can help them bring courage to make new friends and learn about each other. It can also help them with their social life. Instead of being on their phones they are learning together and getting work done. They are also getting to know each other. Second, Working alone can help people concentrate in their work, they could be fast workers, and they dont feel uncomfortable towards new people. It can help them by concentrating in their own work to feel more comfortable with themselves. They could be fast workers because they are not being distracted and they can go on their own speed. They wont feel uncomfortable or awkward by other people because some people dont like meeting or being with people. Most of them just want to be alone or with people they might know. All in all, find what you feel more comfortable with it could be being alone or being in a group to study with people you might want to get to know or with your friends that your comfortable with. Working alone is the best choice for most people because they might be able to work faster, they are fully concentrated in their own hard work and they might just feel comfortable with themselves.",7,6,7,6,6,6,2567,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
649,24,2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything. My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out. My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything. My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time. Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

650,2878,E8B0698217A3,"They say the you should never judge a book by its cover and, especially regarding people, its true. In this case, the cover is not necessary meaning the appearance, but the first impression of another person. Like the cover of a book, first impressions are not always as appealing as what is really there. its not until after you start ""reading"" or get to know someone, when you really find out that what you see is not always what you get. There are several factors that can affect the first impression that one receives from another. Differing personality, situations and representation of a person, make impressions often the worst means of judging people. A persons personality has a big effect on the first impressions that they emit. Everybody is different but when it comes down to it first impressions are really based off of whether you are shy or not. I met my best friend after moving during my junior year, at my new high school. Before i knew her, she never said a word to me or anyone else in the classes that she was kind of odd, but then realized that I was the same way, i didnt talk to many people either because of my personality. I knew that I was shy person and after I get to know someone, I put down my front and show my true colors. I thought that maybe she would be same way. After starting to talk to her a little more each day, our friendship grew and I learned that she wasnt odd at all, but just like me an outgoing person hidden by their shyness. Some people like me and my friend, are shy and put up a reserved and quiet front when facing new people. Based on my first impressions of my friend, I thought something that was far from the truth. One who has a shy personality might in reality be outgoing, but uncomfortable showing it at first, making the first impression of that person a mistaken one. Your first impression of someone is not suitable because you do not know the situation they may be in. When seeing or meeting someone new, you have no idea the kind of day, difficulties or kind of disappointment that person may be experiencing. They may have have recently lost someone, or could be someone new and yet still have to deal with the routines and stresses going through out their day. All of these situations can create a barrier between themselves and others, and setting of a good impression is probably not at the top of their list of important things to do. On my first day of senior year, I walked hurriedly to my first class, even thought I had plenty of time to get there. When I walked into my class, the only thing on my mind was to find a seat right away, no matter if it was by another person or not. when the time come to eat lunch, I sat by myself and ate it quickly so I could proceed to my next class. I was so worried about being late for a class, finding a seat and just doing things right, that i didnt have time to try to leave any good first impression, on any of my peers. It wasnt even on my mind to do so. My peers received the impression that i was nervous and not a sociable person, when really I was acting the way I was because of the situation that I was in. There are many factors that lead to someones first impression of another. Someone;s personality, current situation, or the way they happen to present themselves all influences the way someone thinks about another when seeing or meeting them for the first time. Since what they think is based off of these judgments, their first impressions is usually wrong. If all friendships were based on first impressions, there would be a lot less of them in the world. First impressions are more often worst means of judging a person because its not until you get to really know a person, you are better equipped to understand what kind person they truly are, and really know the individual based on real values, rather than their first impression or ""book cover"".",8,8,8,8,9,7,3374,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

The first reason why I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go. In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and theres no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you shouldnt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective dont get involved as much as your other friends is. Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people dont like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials. In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students dont have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. Its just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to Kings Dominion and once your there you well be like Ive earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something thats giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view Im working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do. Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they dont because were a family and something we always say when were down is dream, believe, achieve . This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also youre parents and family . In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you dont have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

However, some say school shouldnt offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldnt get enough knowledge at home, its better in school. Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students dont understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didnt know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google. Second, video conferencing is helpful.

Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc..

It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and Im happy with it.

654,3525,2A9FC8634742,"What does it feel to achieve a high score on an English test after you study all week for? Pretty good right? You feel like all that sacrifice and long hours of study were worth it. All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self. First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball. Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. In order to success you have to yourself and thats what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition. Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life. To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president.

First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we cant stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes. Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We cant just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance.

With the money you get you can pay all your bills and keep the rest to your self. With a good job you get good money and you can help those who need it the most. You can help your family or people in the streets. With the money your get you can even start you own company. Starting your own company will take time but you will succeed. When you accomplish your dreams help does who need to be helped. My accomplishment is to go to college for many good reasons. You go to college to get a good job and get payed well. If you accomplish you dreams help others accomplish their with all the things your are provided and let them know that just like you help them to accomplish their dreams they should help others too.",7,7,8,5,8,7,121,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 5, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Based with my experience, I agree with Emersons statement. Because we can do something else for grow on the future for our family, it is important think what you will have in one time think for how many things we can have if we work hard. Some peoples are in the street because they do not think on there benefit. sometimes be had opportunity to grow but we lose it. But for some reason people do not like when others people want help them because some times this not are good intention some times one people only want the other person dont grow. But not every persons are the same some one really help other people only who had a lofty heart. On this time nothing is the same the boys and girls only want go to the street and they smoking a lot they never are on the home, the mather and father are very bad, because they dont have idea were their children are. And the children they never grow is they have already mastered, they will never grow. What someone can do with this situation for help the children. if the govern do anything for help those guys we can grow. Because it only they do this they will never grow, the peoples needs helps to grow too, or we need do this with our self no body help us every times is for us depend is we one day change the luck. What we need to do is had a good job if we work hard we can grow more. And in the future maybe are a manager or on the future have a company and grow everyday. with the help of Lord he in the only person who know our destination, and we will grow with help and our effort, we can accomplish everything. When we do something productive we are growing. If you want change your life for something more good, work, help, grow or look for something what can change your life. For example meet a very important job and if you had a good recommendation and if they give for you a job. You had a good job were you will grow more and you not stay the same. The job can help to much and pay to much money if we are good with the work and do everything how the boss want to everybody do. Whenever, you want to do to grow not do more or want more then other or you not do nothing, not startle do more of the other, the people who want grow more then other for them never are something benefit or desire what other had that is not good. its for this the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

The online or video conferencing classes is same like the students are sitting in the classroom. Some students has many problems while to come to school every day. It is good initiative for every student. When students are out of town or country they can study or make-up easily online what they missed in school when they were absent. There are some students who are more benefit for this are those who are too far from their school. For example the student, while going to school they face problems and difficulties every day because they cannot afford a car and his/her school is far from home. Studying online is not a easy way to learn something, but it is good for some students who want to study. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes online because Students can learn easily online when they were absent from school , students who want to study in abroad but cannot come of some reasons, they can learn online easily and students who are disable can learn online easily. Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students can learn or study easily online when they were absent from school. Sometime students who go abroad for their studying had an emergency which they need to go back to their country and they cannot go just because of their school. They dont go because they are going to be missed their lectures and classes and cant make up all work in short time. By taking online or video conferencing classes student can easily make up all their stuffs which they had missed when they go outside of town or country for weeks or month. Where ever students can go, if they have internet access they can study online. If students were absent they can easily make-up work online. For example, If student got injury and nurse told him/her to take 10 day bed rest but student have finals after 2 weeks and they dont want to miss their days.

Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students who want to study in abroad but cannot come of some reasons. They cant afford it. In their country there are not such a good education system thats why they want to study in abroad and fulfill their dreams. It is the good initiative which school take it to give online classes. It helps those students who want to study in abroad. They dont need to go anywhere. They can stay in their country and study through online or video conferencing classes. For example, a student, who has dream to study in abroad to become a doctor but he/she has not enough money to go to abroad and study there. There parents do everything for them but cannot make that enough money to send them abroad. Student think that he/she will never become a doctor. If student take online or video conferencing classes, it would help them to fulfill their dream and reach their destiny. Student would benefit from taking online classes. Online classes give them boost. Students would be benefit from taking classes online because students who are disable, can learn/study online easily. It is the good initiative which school offers for the students who are disable because disable student lose their hope and they think they cannot do anything now. They think everyone is going to make fun of them which never happens. Some disable person cannot come to school , who cannot walk, so they have advantage to attend online classes from home. For example, disable student who dont want to go to school and study just because of their disability. Nobody can force them what to do. They dont have to go anywhere. They have one advantage to take online or video conferencing classes to compete with others. It will give them more confidence in life. To take online classes, they can fulfill their all dreams which they made. It will give them more happiness. Students would be benefit from being able to attend online classes .

662,3800,E733508EEB84,"I think we cant compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work. To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school dont have to follow, First, we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and thats not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students. Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school. Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things, so they will not have time and thats will be a reason why they can left the school. Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time. Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they cant do all. People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week. Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit. One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off. Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they dont have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do. students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn. Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do. all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day. In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages . I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change.

664,1443,E21038BEF290,"Could Impressions Change In this prompt statement i disagree sometimes impressions can change time after time, but some people need help of how to control it ,or they may not know how to express them selves in front of people some impressions change by you trying to say something,a person maybe happy one day and the next day mad, or the person may not like you. Impressions could change in many ways we as citizens, have so many expressions of how we should confront others. Some of the popularity of the United States dont like people because of their impressions, but some citizens hate it when they have the same impressions too. Even though people have problems of how their impressions work also they say that citizens may need help of how to control their: sadness,anger,happiness,and fear when they give impressions to others. Teachers in schools say they have problems with kids attitudes this year of how they approach others, and of how they approach their teachers too. We as citizens cant help of how we express, give impressions,and how to put our emotions out their even so you cant trust your parents,friends relatives for help nor the teachers the government cant help us or the president . People can change their impressions;in so many ways of thinking they can: ask for help, ask for advice,and talk with someone about it. Impressions can be held in different ways of being they can be held by trying to go for something at the store,eating ice cream, talking with someone close. Parents think that their kids or others wont change their impressions towards others even though they think that there can be a possibility that can happen you can try and approach your kids by sitting down with them,giving them time to help them,trying to understand them. Impression can change in many different ways,but its not impossible to make that change sometimes impressions can be helped by others some of the people in the U.S. have problems trying to say good impressions about how they feel,wanting to confront a person,but others just might dislike that person they might also have hate in them,but they might not. Into todays economy people are the same of their impressions,some citizens have the problem of dealing with those impressions,although they have the same emotions but also the same expressions. Everyone has a different background, so they may have different impressions of everybody around them. Impressions can be changed nothing, is impossible to do unless you give in the effort to do it or not try to have confidence of who to trust let impressions change or not nothing is impossible to do unless you put your mind into it.

Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed.

667,217,3816B67C0B31,"When working alone, I agree that it is more time saveing and benifical because. You are more focuesd and consentradedon what your are doing. So when working on a job or school profect, you can gain experiance on working alone. You are also more indipendent when working alone, and that is helpfull when gong to colleg or getting your first job. Others can distract you and waist your time when working as a group, and youll end up doing all the work . Ending up with a bad score in your grade. So because of this , people should be able to consetrate on their self , and do their own work alone when the time comes to do so. First of all, working alone can make you more independent .So when you grow up, and leave off to colleg. Your not going to have any body to leach on, so you should be more consentrated on your self then others becouse. No one is going to want help you on your work. So from being independent, you gain that self confidence, and experiance of working alone. From this you are able to do your own choices. That allows you to get a job, or buy stuff that you want. Second of all, when working alone. You gain a better understaning on the sudject insted of others opinons confusing you on what to do. Independent work can make you understand what your doing , and get a good score at the end or a higher paycheck if its a job. Other may distarct or confuse you on what the sibject is your doing. For an example, You might be doing a battery replacement on car. you would read instructions on how to do. then see an example on what to do, but from that point. the instructions is diffrent then what your trainer did. You might be confused on what your about to do, and then mess put at the end. Others may tell you that your doing it the wrong way, and distract on what your doing. SO working alone may save you time, and be more consentrated on replacing the cars battery, and finishing the job. Finally, working alone can make you more focused insted of being distracted by others. You should focus on your own work then copying the same thing as another student. THat student might no bo corect and you are going to end up with the same failure grade as you stident you copyed from. Or when working in groups. Some students may be lazy. Leaving you with no time left, and making you do all the work. Sometimes others may have a different idea on a subject, amking you both fighting over witch one to do. Or some student may be playing around, making lots of sound. making you distracted, and not finishing the work you were supose to do. It is better to work alone because it will help you fous more, and get a good grade at the work you have done. In conclusion, working alone can save your time, and make you independent on making your own choices. It will also give you that confidence of working independent, so you dont have to ask other on what to do. Working alone is just a good skill to have when you go off into your own life adventure. When you are able to do your choices ehter if its good or bad. You are more independent and responsible of doing your own work, and choices of what todo.

In the actually some kids miss the school for be sicks, some familiar pass away ,they in vacation and they not return in time to the country , they miss the bus school and they cant go to the school beacuse they not have car ,oh they wake up late. This is a benefit because they can learn about the class oh activity and not miss homework oh test and be prepare for the next class in the school, and be in his house relaxing and be in a safe place and always have ready you homework oh test to next class and its ah good benefits to the people ho its in the hospital and can go to the school for ah broken legh oh medical condition .

( In my case i will always if they give me the opportunity to online classes i will always stay in my house relaxing in my bed when i listening the class ) but in the end this option of learn in his house have his good and bad bennefits (some school in the united states are not using this becuse they not have personal wedsites and can garanteed if the student are going to use this ) . ( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ). My personal opinion: In my opinion its ah good offer becouse sometimes i miss the school bus and i cant go to the school becuse i not have ah car and i always miss the class,homework and tests, and this can be help me a lot to have all the work in time and be prepare for the next day of school and be ready take the class oh to take one test . one sad fact: In the intere world some kids can have this oportunity to have online classes in some countries around the world they not have the tecnology to do that so if they miss the school one its like they are missing one day of his life and fact even they are kids ho not are going to the school bacuse the parents not have money to send them to the school ( yep in some countries the education cost money and they not have free schools like united states ) and they have to work in one short age to help his family in my country was like this thaks to good i was alow to go to the school thanks to my mother and come her to the united states so when i come to the school her in united states and i hear students said i hate the school and i wanna be in home i remember my country and i said thanks to this country for give me free education (even in her they do video school conferencing to the people ho not coming to the school and i said wow , Even they do that for the students, and the students are doing protest to have more off days so what i try to said is always thanks to you parents for the education they are give to you and thaks always to you country to give you free education to you can be some one in you future and have a nice work and never ask why i not have this. and always think some in around the world not have the stuff the you have and always thanks to GOD for the stuff you have ( I always do that wen i wake up).

670,2718,AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I dont think its a good idea. But who am I to judge other peoples opinions. So im going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because there either doing school work or there to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

671,3612,A7CEC076632B,"Technology Technology does not effect the way how people interact with another. Think about it like this, some people might just make some type of contact with another person and at the same time doing other things such as in checking your information, money status, savings, and many other things more, yet still making human contact with another. yes i think think for some a occasions it would be necessary and and really nice to make eye contact and interact with one another, for example when you are at a job interview, or even being the job interviewer. Little things like that i would consider to interact with another. Theres many other things that would be important to interact with, especaily if it has to do with yourself. Technology itself is good hepler now in days. It can help you with anything that you are in need of, thats why i say its more of a negative and positive for obvious reasons. Technology does not effect people, or the way they are getting taught. Teachnology is something good for us, helps us keep things more in order, or can hold more information insted of having paper copys all over the place. technology can be a other way of interacting with other people for example like making a phone call, or a text, or even a video call those are other ways of making contact with one another. thats why for those reasons technology isnt making an effect on us as much. Technology, so this where it could effect us. Well one it could effect if the perosn doesnt know how to multitask. Two if can effect you for example with your learning. Three its going to be hard for you to listen and to keep up with who you would be talking to. lets just say you apply for job and your stuck on phone texting others about other job opportunity and your interveiwer send out your job interveiw date and because you were stuck on your phone you miss your job interview. that would suck. for those reasons technology would effect. Technology itself is good and bad because theres many good things that you can do, but theres other things that you could miss. yes they both work good making or not making interactions with or without technology, but i rather have more human contact just because i rather not miss anything.

Winston Churchill is a wise man and i would agree with him. everything he said about failing and being successful after is true. they are so many successful people who have failed plenty of times in their life. it happens to all people no can be perfect at what they want or do in their life. inconclousion Winston Churchill is a wise man for his saying. his saying can motivate many people who feel like giving up after failing.

Like other places, the energy conservation in the school is also important. To have four-day school with additional two hours, is not a good idea due many problems. Having four-day school is a good idea, because of some advantages. By having three days off from school student will have more time to do other things such as, they can spend more time on job, sports, picnics, other courses, etc. The students will have more time to relax and the students will be mentally well prepared for coming work days. Due to this, we can also conserve large amount of energy and other resources. On the other hand, it also has a lot of disadvantages. By having two additional hours every day the student will be tired and they have to do more work every day. As a result, the students will not able to pay attention toward learning. When you are tired you can not able to pay full attention toward studies, due to which this is useless because students will not able to learning anything. This will also effect their grades. The students that do part time job they will face problem in doing that. The students who are willing to participate in extra curriculum activities, they will not able to participate in it.

675,349,34E4FB64EEBA,"Dont you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around? Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? Im nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, Im afraid that my family or my friends judge me. I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. Im agree with the Idea that he have about the world. People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example: You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same. When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they dont let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful. Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else. We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesnt make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want. There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion dont affect and it shouldnt have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we dont want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality. We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and thats why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

Distance learning will benefit students in many ways such as better attendance . If students are allowed to attend school while at home it will give them less chances of not attending. Something that students hate most is waking up in the morning to get ready for school.

I would like to visit Puerto Rico because of the beautiful beachs and rivers. One other reason would be because of my family. First, the weather most of the time is hot even in the winter is hot. In the summer sometimes is ,so hot that it can reach the temperature of 100 degrees. Most of the people living in Puerto Rico are use to the hot temperature. Next, you would see people in the beachs or at the river some people have pool but some people cant buy pools because some dont have money and some people do have money so when the weather is hot you will see most of the people at the beachs or rivers. I personally like going to the rivers because the water is colder and is really refreshing when its really hot. Next, another reason why I pick Puerto Rico was because of there delicious foods there a lot of tropical dishes there is something call the three meat sandwich witch is made of really tender pork meat,chicken,beef then they put potato sticks and then they add the mayo and ketchup. In the holidays like Christmas puertorican people cook a hole pig and then when the pig is done cooking they cut the pig and shred it into pieces and then they eat it with rice mix with beans.

680,328,1300AD075785,"Based on what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I would have to say that i agree with his statement because as a high school student i like to go beyond on what i already know what to do. Emerson wants yous to take another step in what we do he wants us to grow wont you? knowing that we are capable of doing something so much bigger and better and just be able to grow in are generation. Success is something that every6 high school student wants to do we want to get better at something, we want to pass are classes and if we are not willing to go beyond and put forth effort then i dont think we will be able to grow. High school is a great way to show this especially if your a student athlete; lets say that you play baseball or softball or any other type of sport that takes time to master. Playing a sport is not easy especially if you want to get a scholarship. I get ask this question all the time ""have you yet mastered being a Cather and going beyond that point to see what you have in stored?"" I have mastered the skills of a softball catcher but i know if i go beyond that point and keep practicing i know that i will be a great softball player in my years to come. Believing in your self to do something can also help you grow, just being able to say I got this and giving it all you got just gets you a step closer to becoming a master and growing into it. Another this is mistake those are alright , no one is perfect everyone is going to have there flaws and thats ok thats another way of growing and learning; wont you want to go beyond something you already mastered and try something new to grow? Emerson wanted us to read this quote and think about what it meant to us. I ready this quote and it gets me to think "" so if i go beyond on my catching and try something else i could grow into the sport and play multiple positions on the field instead of just one."" I could also say the same thing about JROTC in my school as being part of the drill team and going to competitions. These are good examples on what we can all think about going beyond d and farther in what we already know an think about what we can do better so we can grow and learn from are mistakes. High school is a great place to start not even then you can start when ever you want just make sure you know what you want to do and just have fun and enjoy your life. The quote can also be for adults, who have already mastered in something like for example my father, he created his own software and designed it for offices and he is out of town right now in Generic_City so that he can install it and, just grow from that experience he is going beyond on what he dose at work and just making something great happen. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ,""unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you go this prompte and you read it and you have to pick if you agreed or disagree what would you pick? what would you tell me to make me agree or disagree with you?

684,1562,1B622A28EDD9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very benificial, because you wouldnt have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. Youd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you wont have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldnt have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well. Id like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you dont pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when your at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldnt have to worry about this. Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would by that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better. My final reason would be less stress. I say this because Im stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get to much homework and most of the times I dont get time to do it because of work or family. Im the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyones ok. Making me not do homwork after school. Most of the times I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldnt have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed. I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but thats during class after class its nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something and you wont be able to have someone to help. At school we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disavantages. I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has there own way of learning.

So, i think if students go to after school club to finish there homework, etc then the students wont have to worry about it at home and keep there grades in good shape. Also to keep it simple its important to have something important like this (after school club) to let the students know they have after school to help them complete there homework. And then, if students need help on completing there homework, etc then the students can come to after school to get the help they need. And create a bond with other students by helping each other. therefore i think there should be a after school club to help, do, and support. 3 gt",6,5,6,6,7,5,752,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

And even though you dont show a lot of kindness even a little bit change on the other person because of the kindness that you were showing. If you think showing kindness is a waste dont think that because showing some kindness can show the other person that you care about them. Also you can think that not showing enough kindness is bad then you wrong because even just a little bit can show yourself and the other person that you care and that you nice. Even though your not the type of person to show kindness to others can change about what the other person thinks about you like maybe the person thinks oh like this person doesnt care about me. But when the person show kindness can change the option on what the person is thinking about you. And if your the person that is always nice and you think your not good enough because you think that you dont show enough kindness just know if you say something nice or show thats kindness.

Therefore, even knowing that he was giving up, he started to create a plan, it was a bout a project that should chnge his life, some of his friends tell him, that he will never going to graduated, and that he wouldnt achieve his goal, but, he never give up, and when summer cames. He graduated from the university, 4 months later, he created his own bussiness of tourism and travel. As a result, he was trying to do something that someone else wasnt doing, he was trying to grow up someting that should make big changes in his life, and in his family.

688,240,A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity. Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide. Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life. My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college. go to school guys and stay in school.",7,6,8,8,6,6,2144,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
689,1244,E110443F5184,"""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Therefore,in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path. Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits cant be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parents traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my moms gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits. Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show. Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse. As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait. Therfore I always said ""Character trait can be beautiful but a curse in disguise"". Anyway not a problem. That I truly believe that everyone has the right to chose their own character traits then having someone influences them to have the same character trait as them then having your own traits.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3215,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
690,1250,F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesnt mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up its what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like. For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesnt mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer cant do and that it trying to learn new things. We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing cant stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we dont want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesnt want it, doesnt keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter. We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we havent master it. That is the big challenge that we havent try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we havent control our emotion and that is the challenge that we havent master it. For that we have issues that we arent able to figure it out because its hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesnt understand why they react like that. That what make us to try new things in life because we are curious about what interest us as human being and see if can master it so ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered keep trying new thing that you would be able to do and get your attention to it "".",6,5,5,5,4,6,3681,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Most people, has a unique a ability. That all over the world want to hear your name. These pass few years, people pass down there outstanding skill to generation to generation.

In fact, tell them to be in their shoes. Generation grows bigger and bigger; Wonder what would happen next. On the other hand, you might as well encounter something that you never try before, a challenge. In this position, people want to test their master skill to the test. It good thing because you want to prove yourself ,as an expert, that you want to be anonymous person who tries so hard to achieved their goal. People will say ""Dream Big"" or ""Just do it"" that gets people motivate to face their mastered skills to the next level. Dreaming for a challenge beyond their skill, is a goal for them, they dont want to give up. If they do, whats the point of hard work.

Taking myself as an example or personal experienced person,I had always wanted to be a model when I was kid which I still want to be, but one thing have noticed is that you cant do anything on your own without sometimes you need help from people around you. Becoming a model was my idea and something I think it will be better for me and nothing beyond that standard; was calling people for help, applying from one agency to the other but there was no help. Sometimes people even want to take advantage of that to use for their satisfaction(sexually) even though I know that is bad I still wanted to do it because of the goals I have set for myself .

700,76,81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like theyve had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path. When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career. Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they werent good enough didnt just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. Theyve taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, theyve given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts. However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.",8,8,8,7,7,8,1713,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

First, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. Everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better. It is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it . Second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. It is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. Recently, my friend Generic_Name got bully in school two moths ago, Generic_Name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that Generic_Name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully Generic_Name. After that, Generic_Name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling. Third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them.

A lot of kids like to play indoors and not do activitys. kids like to play video games with friends and they have fun. Also there are kids that dont like going outside and like staying in inside they can read play games play with friends because they might have not any interest in anything or not might have many friends to play with in an activity.

707,2740,CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I dont like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus its gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now. First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more. Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school. Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers. Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time its not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea. ",6,6,6,5,6,7,2847,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, dont allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. This information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life. Summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness. The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation. In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. If in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of High School should be enough time to learn more about carrers. For example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. Being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams. This decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds its better than summer courses.

In my opinion going beyond what you have already mastered is a great way to achieved more goals and the more steps you take the more experience you will get than just focusing on what you have already mastered,because achieving more and taking risk in every journey that you made is a great way to know how important each step you take is and going beyond that will prove how strong and passionate you are to be more successful. For example if you are in a soccer team and your team had already won three goal that should not give you the risk to relax and think that you have already mastered what you were trying to get ,go beyond that and play more harder and get to were you want to be until you feel accomplished that will give you the courage to try to do more and never look down. Another reason why people should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered is it will set an example to the public by showing how ethusiatic you are in any part that you take ,because you are aiming to get more and win more and you will be a role model to the young generation, For example if someone is trying to let go because they had already got what they want they will take you as a mentor, because you at the other side never stop even though you have already mastered and accomplished more but you are still aiming to get more and you are still growing. Another reason to go beyond is it will impact you in your after life and you will also feel proud that you never let go you take risk you go beyond your thought, for eaxample you another person who have already mastered what they want and they feel good withwhat they have already get and you gop beyond that makes you a hero.

After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,there changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life. This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think there going to be success. However, letting young kids think on what there going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didnt decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldnt get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didnt want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didnt decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what theyre looking for in real life as a young adults.

Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone. Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working ""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new ideas. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity. Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes. Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group. if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others. working in a group is also good for getting other peoples opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement. Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster.

True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember. Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder. This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve. This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished. Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger. Also achievement helps you praise yourself. What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things. Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals. It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good. So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself. Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction. For example, you have jsut achieved a goal youve had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it. Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up. satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself. Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember.

Overall , people have to take their own decisions using the best way for each of them , Because decisions are not easy to take you must take it without precupation because when we worry about that and we say or we do the first thing that it comes to our brain isnt one hundred percent right sometimes it can be good or not but thats how we learn of our mistakes , thats how life work , it give you a hit when you must think nothing is going to happend, thats why is important to count with friends or your mom and dad but when youre going to ask an opinion of what decision shoul you take you must ask an adult , they are the only ones that they can give you the best ideas of what is better for you and your future and thats how you learn and the most important to grow as a person .

718,1290,7B5F5B33B566,"When people ask for advice , they sometimes talk to more than one person. Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it. In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if Abraham Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that. Only instead its intellects make the right choice to help you. In Conclusion, advice is there to help you, opinions are there to guide you to something that gives you smarts to making the right choices in the world we live in live, sure not all opinions hear might not be in your favor. But just hear them out and be the best you that you want to be shaped in, advice will make yo wiser and more aware of scenarios.

720,2857,F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine. The first reason is peoples communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you havent talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be. The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you wont be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident. Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the persons mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before. The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the peoples preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesnt have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device. In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and dont wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",7,7,9,6,7,8,3747,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others. The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when Im cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group dont help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when Im sick, and I cant go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits. Its obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others.

723,3621,DBCAB09E41C7,"This is a good idea, and the educators should be agree with this. Summer Break should be more longer. We fell the summer is not enough time for us to enjoy the vacations. We need more weeks to rest and enjoy the beach and many things. I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break. because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. I think idea is great. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer. Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. The educators should know this and think about. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students. In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family.

725,2832,DBDBF971510B,"It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit. In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course. Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just wont show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes. Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits. In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to.

726,1273,DDCB2CC96EA7,"I am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. Although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people. Those who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. One reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. But doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. People that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .Many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. Did you know is that 90% 0f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. It is very scary and make me sad at the same time. If we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind. However, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. Learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. Having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. We are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. In my position I have a experience; when I was in my country I did not what to do with my life; I just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here I am making better things for my life; now I am tinking about to have a better life. when I came to USA I was tinking about how am I going to do if I do not nothing about the language but now I feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. I though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life. Also, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. There are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; I think that every people are genius. The things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them. I have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. Had you ever try to help others? I have it done many times. When I was in my country I saw this person trying to be better but at the same time this person was with many problems that did not let to keep going. In many occasion I help the person to be better like getting solutions with the problems and it is very difficul to teach others with the problems and try to make them better. Seeing our life in a failure can be the worst thing, but keeping trying to do better things each day is going to be the better effort in our life and that is going to help us to get more enthusiastic every day. It is very helpful to find ways to be better in the world because every person had to have new things to do the life better for themselves and help others if they are struggling with their life.

You really just want a person to give you really good advice and see if it help you, if it doesnt help you go talk to another person and see if the advice they give you is more comfortable and helping. The reason some people do this is because they probably get the same advice the other person already told you and already tried doing that and it just doesnt seem to do anything really. What i would to is try to go find a person that has been through the stuff your going through/trying to do and take their advice it really help because that person has already been through those things or tried to do those things and went to someone that has already been through it to and took their advice and it really seem to work. They might just also go get advice from multiply people to see which advice the person gives them is best. They can also just be going to person to person for advice to see if they are really there and car about you when your going through a really difficult time. They can be doing that because the person they went to first was not really giving them advice about what your going through and just throwing things in that dont even make sense. I would just go to someone that really gets you and is there for you and knows how you feel. Some people that do this just really want comfort because you never know what their going throw and really just wanna take everything off there mind and just want advice for all the things their going through.

729,914,E8F6D6EA06F1,"Should you agree to letting the school board add one and a half hour to the school days. I disagree because it will make students less excited to come back to school the next day. Students already have the work they have to do after school, adding more time to the schools will give less time for what the students have to do once they get home. Students have the work in school that they get normally, but once the school board adds more time, the students will have the stress that they dont need. The time that the school board adds will impact the students time, stress, and family management. Students will come to school with less happiness. Once the student gets to the school, they will have to do the same work with more time that they could have used to do their daily needs. Students need the time with their love ones so that they could get work off of their minds. Students will have to come back to school with one and a half less time to regain their thoughts and sleep for the next day. Giving more time to schools will effect students daily plans. When the student goes home its for their time to get the work form the school done and to enjoy the time with their family. Adding more time will effect the family time together, in replace that they will have to work on the time they wanted to talk with their family. Students will argue to the school that it is unfair that they have to have more time in school, then they will be mad that they have to take one and a half hour away from the time they get out of school. Adding more time to the school will put more stress on the students. Students already have work on their mind when they are in school, adding more time will just add more work that leads to stress. Once the student has stress they have to find a way to get it out but, they have to to work in the school and get work to do at home gives the student no time to get it out.

Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate. Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want. Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer. In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.

731,749,F3ACD9A99ADA,"Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchills statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didnt have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didnt take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later. My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want, A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didnt pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success. Other might say that success and failing isnt good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say You can loss a battle but not the war, In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm. In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchills statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and dont surrender dont give up with our goals, always been happy doesnt paying attention to the situation.

In life you live and learn lessons, dealing with stress after stress, or learning that every struggle you faced at the end it will pay off. The key to success in life is having a positive attitude: never envy what others have, nor wish bad upon a person for their success. Trust the process, life will knock you down, get you at your lowest but having that positive attitude towards every struggle and having that positive mindset to others will get you further than you think, having that negative attitude towards everything wont get you far in life: hatred, jealousy, and hard headed wont take you nowhere: in life you are going to face the fact that not everything will go right, and not everything is going to be how you want it. This statement about having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is true, nothing will get you far if you have a negative attitude towards everything that comes your way. If something didnt work out theres always a reason why it didnt went how you expected it, either you decide to work harder to get where you want to get or just give up and not do anything to get you closer where you want to be.

734,1150,E2F767441B44,"If in high school should young students be capable of committing to a career. Some adults say that young students should pick a career. Others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. The age shouldnt determined how committed you can be to a career. Being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits. Early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. For example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. Starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. Those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. Your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience. Making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. For example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. So, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. Starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. This gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesnt need to be taught. Having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them. The students will have some confidence before going into their career. For example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you wont expect anything new. This will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into theyre career. Before entering a career its good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. A boost of confidence is what students need before going into something. On the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. For example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. Some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. So, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they cant decide on some of the most simplest decisions. Those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision. Having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. They get to learn more in advance then the rest. Also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. That many positive outcomes will come out of starting early. So, I believe that students can commit to a career at a young age in high school. ",10,8,8,8,6,8,3263,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

Some people think that are impossible to change, because they had been said or think that you cannot change your first impression, when you at first meet or start knowing someone, that is not true because clearly you can change your first impression, even though it can be the same or different as the first impression you had at the beginning of everything, but you may also be insecure or confuse of your own thoughts and feelings. I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people. The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning. The day I came to this school Generic_School, my impression from when I meet my counselor Generic_Name were different from my impression after I meet her, I thought she was going to be really mad and mean counselor or I even thought she was going to be a counselor that doesnt like Hispanic people, but all my thoughts were wrong, my impression was really wrong because my thoughts about her were wrong, now that I know how is my counselor, my first impression and perspective changed from the one that I used to have and believe. In conclusion, as the end of this prompt that it has been first impressions are almost impossible to change is wrong, that is not believable because your first impressions and your own thoughts can be wrong, even though you thought it was going to be something at the end is not how you thought it was going to be, first impressions are possible to change because they can be wrong even though your perspective can be true, or it can be also wrong. Dont let first impressions to trick you because they may be wrong, you can change them if you want, but make sure to be secure.

736,2739,4FD4CE18CCDF,"I think seeking multiple opinions would be better, because you can actually view multiple perspectives and then decide which one is the best. For example, you can make a list of pros and cons to see which one you like the most. Or, you can take a vote on what to do. You will also be able to listen better and be more supportive of other people. You will as well as compromise better with multiple people rather than one specific person. For example, lets say someone wants a dog. He or she is going to have to listen to many peoples opinions about having a dog. One person could say, ""Having a dog is a very big responsability. So dont get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""Its really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean its mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best. Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Dont do it. Its not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! Its not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so thats why people need to compromise, to both get what they want. One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie Billy Madison. However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if theres any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until youre at the age. Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If youre lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night. Thats why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if its right or wrong.

737,3631,AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that theyre more successful than you. Thats exactly why you shouldnt trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but dont put your 100% trust in them because its always that one person that you wouldnt expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldnt let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, dont to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that thats you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself. You shouldnt be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone theyre, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person theyre with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they cant accept who you are? Shouldnt you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how theyre acting towards you. Thats why I dont let people influence me in any way because you never know what that persons intentions. be your own person and dont ever be someone yourre not, and you should never change for someone just cause they dont like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see whos really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend dont respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go. My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and dont let somebody take control in your life or dont get influenced by people that dont have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Dont try to be perfect for somebody elses, if you wanna do that then do it dont do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it. But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you cant trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Dont try to act or be somebody that youre not, show who you really are and your true color because thats how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest.

738,599,E4C49D70C330,"What would happen if the school menu is change? Most of the kid will be upset because the menu have all the delicious food they like. This does not mean this food is healthy. United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol. Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app. All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol. In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse. A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat. One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza. This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body. And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future. In my opinion considering being part of the school community and thinking about my future and my classmates I think that including a more healthy menu in the school cafeteria would be one of the best ideas for everyone.

Teenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they dont follow the curfew. It is dangerous for teens to stay out late because the world we live in now is not as safe as we think it is. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew. If they want to go out somewhere past the curfew then they always have a choise to go with their parents. Usually, most teens dont have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger. If teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law. They can get in a lot of trouble from their parents and the police for breaking the law. Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. Another example why teenagers shouldnt be out after curfew is because, most teenagers when they go to paties they smoke which is really bad for their health. The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep. Now days teenagers dont spent so much time with their parents. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Staying after curfew would definetly keep teenagers out of danger and trouble. Teens can aslo have extra time to their homework. It is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew for their own safety. All the reasons that are above is only because, so it shows what would happen if the teens dont follow the curfew.

Homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. Homework club is a big help for students. Theres so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early. At homework club you get so much help from the teachers. You can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. If a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. The best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. Its like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. Projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. If your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help. Another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. The teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. If you didnt know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. I can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. Many students cant really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they cant concentrate studying when they are alone. So if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. I recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. If you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz The last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and I guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. Math teachers, Science teachers, History teachers, and English teachers are going to teach students so much more. You can go to homework club and do your homework early so you dont have to worry about doing it at home. In homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more details. What I mean is that the teachers will teach you more about that subject. Homework club is one of the best club their is. It helps students learn more about the subject, it also makes them have more confidence, and it makes them be more active with your classmate at homework club. Homework club is a community full of amazing students and teachers. Theres so many things teachers at homework club help you with and that is Helping you get your projects done in time, helping you study for a test/quiz, and helping you finish your homework early.

741,2635,4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by. For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person. What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life. The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Lets say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isnt anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience. Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Lets say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him thats not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him.

743,2798,DC467256CD82,"Technology, 21st centuries finest product. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say ""technology will end our social life."" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say. Primarily technologys goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think theyll die. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and thats a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face. Secondly, technology has its pros as it has its cons. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy. Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it. Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Human is a social creature by its nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. If someone tries to change a creatures nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them.

First of all,students have lots of work to do like homework,chours, projects, and etc. These things are a lot for some students to handle. adding a extracurricular activity that students must participate in would increase some students stress and could cause students to fail in school cause of how much work they have to do and complete. Finaly, some students just dont want to do it. Beause most students would finish their work and hang out and talk with their friends. If students where forced into participating in at least one extracurricular activity it would decrease the amount of time each student would have spending time with their friends. In conclusion, I think that what the principal decision was not a good and was a very very bad.",7,7,7,7,7,6,3493,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Are video games really that fun for people in their 30s. Why do they find This Activity Enjoyable. First, Why do kids find playing video games exciting. Do they believe its exciting and invigorating to play video games. Video games are exciting to kids because of the action danger and excitement they get each time they play a video game. Are video games a stress reliever for stressed kids and adults. Some video games can be frustrating, but some are relaxing and soothing for the mind like Tetris and Pokemon. Second, There are many video games in the world that people like to play like Fortnite, League Of Legends, Roblox and more. Kids play games cause of how fun it is. Kids like to play video games like a pack of wolves looking for food. Kids use their senses when playing its like their getting a mind workout while playing a video games and they just dont know it. adult and kids use 3 senses when playing video games hearing( listening) touch( ability to play) sight (looking around). They use their other senses when eating and smell the food. Third, Video Games has a downside to adults and kids. They ruin your eye sight if you stare at them for a long period of time. They can make your attention span really slow. Makes you shy of the outside world and of other people. There are risks when having fun. Lastly, Kids enjoy playing video games cause it video games they dont care about the consequences that come with playing them.

746,343,40E6BC53EC01,"Just imagine you have an important basketball game at your school. Since you have three hours to get to the school, you decided to go watch a movie with some friends. When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end, that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports. First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home. Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure, materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school. Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health. Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",6,6,6,6,6,6,847,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
747,3272,2D940E7F240C,"Do you think that schools should extend the school hours for 1 hour and 30 min? I agreee with this plan because it would help students education. It can help students with their education: The teachers would be able to explain more to the students so they can understand properly. Teachers can help educate the students by using the extra time to do more projects. The teachers can read more books with the class so they can be good readers and writers. It would give students less days of school: Students can get more relaxing time and come to school with a lot of energy. Students can get more time working on school work/homework at home during the weekend. Students wouldnt have to worry about going to school on the days that the school chooses to skip. It can help students can get a lot smarter with extra hours: The students can get extra time to do homework and trying to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. The teachers can take the whole class to the library to check out or read books with the classroom. Students can have an extended gym time to get rid of all the energy inside them so they can learn and obtain all the information from the teachers. I think that the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes would help students with education.

School online may help others then going to actual school. Maybe the person is going through something in school. Doing school at home my be easier for some students, they probably learn quicker and probably finish school faster. Others may not work that way, some maybe work slower in school, so they wanna work at their own paste . Others may just wanna tryout school at home. On the other note its good for schools to do that. If some students were going on a trip they could easily do school on the road. I would help them stay on track with the class. or maybe the student did something bad in school that it would lead them to do school at home. Oh and if a student gets sick to the point to where he cant come to school ,and it was something bad they would do school at home. To be completely honest i dont like this idea at all. Its because i did it for a good old 3 years, and it was a bad experience for me. I wouldnt remand it, but if you where going through somethings then yeah go for it.

Technology performs multi-tasks without physical contacts with others. Due to this, people dont have to go to stores to get groceries and other materials. This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health. Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public. In cases of emergency, social media has been proved to be the fastest way of saving lifes, accidents, and most importantly many deaths. Obviously, technology has made it possible for kids who dont like school, and are poor learners at school due to the nature of the environment to learn online at home giving them another opportunity to become something great. Even though they dont make physical contact with friends, they are provided a better learning environment, less stressful activities, and the motivation to learn more and become a contribution to the societys well being which evryone today wants. Again this brings us to the good part about social media, though kids may not have physical contacts with friends, they have the social media.

751,1476,EF5922BDE9E5,"Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups. Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. Its a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when its due. When my teacher assigns group its way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. Its also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A. Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. Sometimes teachers doesnt know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. Seeking help from a classmate thats in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier. In conclusion , working with groups its more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done.

I believe its had a good positive effect on peoples lives. see it this way, technology helps us so much like buildings cars and airplanes, technology has taken over restaurants in such a way that you no longer have to tip! technology and stores do mix and its just speeding up the process. Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, thats incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize. Who wouldve known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days? Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. Thats why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes theyll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but youll get use to it as time continues. Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives. How stressful would it be for Ford Junior to hire millions of workers, and finish one car every five hours? or opening up a restaurant and hire twenty workers who are rude, lazy to there customers? and last but certainly not least, Walmart having hundreds of workers who take forever to scan and pack your items.

754,438,A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades. One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way. When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesnt have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students wont lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and wont stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teachers teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school. There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges dont go to students homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need. Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home.

If you add more hours, students will be picked up every last period and not even be there when the teacher is teaching.

758,3757,A4BBB301E3CE,"I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you havent done before. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success. On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life. When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. You should always be happy about trying new things. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. Giving up ruins your life. In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

759,3263,EBD07D2D103C,"I oppose the idea of schools offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes,this is because not all students benefit from attending classes from home,and online. Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher.

And that will make your life so much easier. You should should never wait for tomorrow to do something if you can do it today. Also, you cant be idle for the rest of your life. You cant be successful if youre just going to idle. To be soemthing in life you have to work hard for it. You always have to push yourself to the max limit. But at the end itll all be worth it. I remember my mom always used to tell me that ""Never wait for tomorrow to do something that you can do today."" And that will be in my head for the rest of my life. I use that quote to motivate myself when Im doing homework or going to the gym etc. It always works and i will always live to that. My whole family lives to that qutoe. The world would be such a better place if people didnt idle. If people were determined to work hard for themselves, everybody in the world would be succesful. Also more people would be enjoying a more wealthy life. Less people wouldnt need a place to sleep. Their would be more people enventing stuff to make the world a better place. Everybody in the world would have water and food. You would make your whole family proud. Give back to the people. Do unreal things that no human has ever done before. Maybe even go to every planet to see if humans are able to live there. Their would be less crimes and less lives lost. Also more opportunities for people to succeed. Finally, Thomas Jefferson wrote that quote for a reason. For people to succeed in life. It was for people to look at the quote and actually do it and not idle.

To be sucessful you have to accomplish everything in life. any people in this world today, have gotten good position for their accomplishment. i know, some time its hard to do but like i said if you want to accomplish something in life you have to work for it. for example: like the brids we see today they have to go through a lot of stages. bruds cannot just be born and start to fly the same day they have to go through before they fly. so they accomplish their flyinh by process and it is the same as human we go through processes to accomplish things we want. our lives go by days and hours the day we see today will never return so why not accomplish somehting within that day because when that day is gone you have waste thime,and abilities to accomplish something. lets be honest the world today need someone that never give up. it is amazing for some one to reward you for your accompishment. today many of us went to be a doctor,lawyer, and so on but, we are not putting the effort and time. one way to accomplish thing in live is this pay attention to things, learn from mistake using your time and effort if you found yourself doing this you are going to accomplish many thing. the reason why many poeple dont accomplish things is this they dont pay attention not willing to ascept their wrong doing and don,t use their time and effort. for example; i want to be a doctor i have to pay attention in biology class, read books, and also make good grade iam accomplishing what are want to do because are do it constanly and i love it to so that give me more intrest in doing it. therefore, to make the world a better place we have to do better talking by mouth and not putting to action it don,t work so if you ready want to accomplish some thing in live you have to always do it never give up and always found your self doing something not playing arround be a better you for your tomorrow. santly ",6,6,6,7,5,5,3812,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Schools should often do it and will affect these students careers. Kids have these types of dreams that they want to do and learn to get into. They often have the right to ask anybody why these things will help students have a good career and a college degree. The main reason is that this can help kids so much and tell their parents what they learn. The reason why schools should allow to do this so that kids can go to college and when they are done they can do the job forever and they get the emotion inside of them. Learning so much is the only thing that should help students in school to get all the information inside of their head so that can get them where they want to be. Some dont really have a good thing what they want to do when they are trying to think what they want to do in their life, but it can be a hard choice to decide. Things can really get so good when ever we decide what we tell our parents what we want to do for our lives and other peoples too. What we think is that when we go out in the world and see what we think about or something that shocks you when you get so surprised about it and you get it in you head and thats what you want to do. The job that kids want to do when ever they grow up is the only thing they want to do or something else thats more better than the other one.

Its a good thing that parents should make kids work for a job to get money and save up to go to college and have a good time. The thing is that schools have the right idea to teach kids what they should and what they should learn about.

Activity in society can help people reach their goals, help society, live life to the fullest, feel good and use time wisely. In this world people have big reasons to have activity life for example, they need one work where maybe all the time they are move for this reasons and more I think that the people need one activity life. Small actions like recycling or participating in community this help to disperse a good life for you and for the other people because people look that you have one purpose in the life.

767,2536,D948703E8026,"Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers? You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work. To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them. Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things. Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew. In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.

768,3663,298969937643,"I am against this issue because, its just not a good idea for students to graduate high school early, and enter the work force and college one year early. My reasons for this would be that, those who do graduate early will miss out on school activities. They will have to do so much preparation. Some dont see that after high school life gets tough, and who knows if theyll be able to handle it. Early graduates will graduate a year early, but, they dont realize that they will miss out on school activities. Some activities that excite students would be, the school dances such as prom, and homecoming. Dances are meant to enjoy a night with friends, and get all dressed up for the night. Also the day before a dance, there is always a football game, which is exciting because everyone goes to support the team and if they win they celebrate the day after, which would be at the dance. Pep- rallies are when all four grade levels come together and verse each other on which class has the loudest cheer, and who has the most points when it comes to the games they end up playing. Spirit week is also when all classes verse to win points. To earn the points they must dress up as the theme of that day or buy what is being sold that day. The themes they would usually do would be twin day Monday, polka dot Tuesday, and for the sells it would be spirit chains that get hung up. Senior activities are when all the graduates do their last activities with those classmates theyve been knowing since elementary school. They have a senior picnic which is when only the seniors go and have lunch together. Also some go on a class trip and they take their class picture. Even though early graduates will miss out on school activities theres more important things than that. They might think that they are ready, but in reality they dont think about the preparation they need to face. Depending on what diploma they are headed for either the standard or advance, each diploma has its requirements for graduation. Standard diplomas really dont ask for much. There might be a chance that you wont be in need of doubling up on classes. Unlike the advance diploma it asks for so much. An advance diploma may require you to double up due to the fact that it requires many classes. Also students wont be able to take any of those exciting elective courses that are by most the best classes a student could take. Of course the classes arent the only thing that must be completed, there are many tests that take place. Math, science, history, and the most difficult would be the English test. They must pass each test for graduation. This would mean that, students wont have time to distract themselves by other things, and, will have to stay on task to maintain their grades up. Some might say otherwise that if theyre going through this road its because they are aware and are ready. Although graduating early excites them, it is better if they wait another year and graduate when they have to. My reason to this would be because the work force and college will be completely different than high school. High school might be the easiest part of starting to understand life. Most students that graduate early are juniors, and are sixteen and seventeen years of age. This is pretty difficult at that age, they would have a hard time finding a decent job that will help them pay their tuition; unless they have another way of paying like a scholarship or some other way. Perhaps some might do both work and school at the same time, but, it could end up being too hard on them because they are too young and arent as prepared as they thought. If some were to be at the age of eighteen they would have to face adult responsibilities; such as taxes, rent, insurance, and much more. However some might think otherwise. People who favor this issue support early graduation. Their reasoning would be that its an early start in life, and some students do it certain reason. It could be a family matter or other reasons. But, I disagree, in no way is graduating high school early good. Those students that graduate early will miss out on so many good things that come with high school. They will be stressed due to so much they had to do just to get out a year early; if that didnt stress them out then having to go college and going to work to pay for their education will.

People like to spend time outdoors doing fun stuff like Snowboarding. Snowboarding is a cool way of spending time outdoors,because a lot of children like to play in the snow,so snowboarding is a fun way of playing in the snow.

770,492,767920BDAD93,"Wouldnt it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning. Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends. Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Names fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class. Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didnt like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the schools free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousins grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning. In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students.

There are multiple ways to have fun at parks for example, you can play soccer, explore the park, and play football with your friends and family. First of all, when youre at a park you most likely want to have a good time with your family and friends. Soccer is a good way to relax. You may ask "" Why is soccer a good activity to relax?"" well, when youre playing soccer you can get your mind off things. It helps you think more on the game then what else is going on out side of the field. Also soccer is a good way to communicate with one another. Second of all, you can play a game of football. Football is also a good way to communicate with one another. For example, in football if we want to win we have to have a good game plan. So, we have to gather our opinion and thoughts to make the right plan. Football is a good way to bring everyone together to communicate. Third of all, you dont always have to play a sport to have fun. You can go explore around the park. For example, you can go walk around, look at the beautiful trees and flowers, and go hiking. While you are also there you can take beautiful pictures! To sum up, there are multiple activities you can do at the park. Think about other activities that you can do with your family and friends. There are many more than those three for sure. You also have to think about others too and what they want to do. Therefore, there are many other enjoyable activities out there.

775,3899,3D72844EC5B0,"Well, Im desagree with this statement, because no always your first impressions of something its impossible to change. Sometimes you will have a lot of impressions of people,things,or animals..However some percent of humans can not change their first impressions ,because they think that ,they are sure about their impressions , and there is when your mind has to change,so you can check first to make sure that yours impressions are rights,and I will support my response putting myself like a example; One day , I was at my house doing some work out ,and then I started to having some strainghts impressions, That I had the impressions that my girlfriend was cheating ,with my best friend, so I get mad ,because that impression was to difficult to believe, also you have to be carefully, when you have a bad impressions of someone, you have to know how reaction will be. Also you have to make sure that yours impressions is right, so I called my girlfriend and we had a long conversation , but the thing is that I did not know , how tell or ask her my impression that I had with her and my best friend, however I was trying to change my impression, but my mind and my brain was confucing, because that impression can put me in problems with my girlfriend or somebody else, so the thing is that I did change my impression ,knowing that not all your impressions thyat you think are rights, some impressions that you get sometimes, its because you are not sure about something, or you no truths in that person who make you have a bad impression. My point of this statement is that the first impression its possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressionas or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not. Now, when I have impressions I keep for myself, that is one of the ways to change your first impressions, because that help me on my first impressions.",4,5,6,4,4,5,790,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports. Also, if the internets not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students cant learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

780,752,12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that Ive grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field. My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion. The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship. In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me. ",10,10,10,10,9,10,259,"conventions 10, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that students life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life. If a student doesnt believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that students life time. Student that doesnt think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they dont try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldnt make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasnt my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if its not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",5,4,6,4,4,5,2268,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
782,2356,3FD4C280E4EF,"Summer Prompt Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily when they return in the fall. I think summer should not change because it would have a negative impact on students; such as, not enjoy summer time. Some people argue that there should be a year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. Some student said that break during school year sounds good; however, they would enjoy better summer time because of the weather. In personals experiences, I enjoyed summer break better then winter break because in summer I was available to play outside; in the other hand, during winter break I wasnt available to play outside because the weather was too cold. Student also think that they enjoy summer break better because they dont have the pressure of homework, and after school activities. I think summer break is long enough for those who need extra help, so they can attend to summer school. I enjoy summer break because it is also the part of the year where days are longer enough to expend time with friends. I also enjoy summer break because it is the only par of the year where I can spent time fishing, which is what I enjoy the most. I think having certain of breaks during school year will make difficult for student to concentrate. Think you dont understand a topic in algebra; you get some help, and finally you start to understand it, but you realize that fall break is next week, and it will interrupt with your learning. I think thats a consequence of having certain of breaks during school year. There should not be a short summer break because it is the only time people spend the most time with their family. I think thats the most important think of summer; spend time with the family. It is also the part of the year that people get off their stress. People is adapted with the school program and they will not like the idea of having it change. I think the society is adapted with the system that we have currently.

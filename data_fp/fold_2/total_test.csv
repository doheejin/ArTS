0,1564,28639BE05BB7,"Music, drama, art class are considered as an elective class. Since such class will never be use in a daily basis in life. Its not required for you in order to graduate so to speak there is many more choices rather than music, drama, and art class to replace with it. It shouldnt be a required class for the student to take since everyone has a different mindset of what they want to be. Something we use in our life that we learn from school is basic math to do our taxes and bills, but when will you ever use music, drama, or art in life, Its more like a hobby rather than a need in order to maintain a stable life. People dont care if you know how to write a song, act melodramatic, and how to draw Mona Lisa, applying for a job with such thing in your portfolio wont get you employed in most places. If you major in such things, only those of who are talented and skilled will only be able to have a successful life in such class. Electives are there for a reason, to have a starting point of what you want to be in the future, if it was turned to a required class, the world would have a second renaissance. You dont need it in order to graduate. College wouldnt look into those as much as the prerequisite to your diploma or the major subject. Knowing how to paint or sculpt clay wouldnt be at the SAT that college look into if youre eligible of going to their school or if they want you. As people grow up and go to college, their goals will change eventually. For example, you grow up and you want to be a doctor and half way through your college year you want to be a Scientist instead. Youve covered some similar classes or lessons already since they are both major in science, but such classes like music, drama, or art class doesnt have any similarity when you changed your goal. They are a specific to themselves, they dont have a wide broad of category that shares with other subjects at all. Learning and able to make music, be dramatic, and draw art might be a useful thing. Write songs for famous artist, act on plays and movies and even be recognize for your work in arts and make a lot of money from it. Only if you are successful, whether you are born with a talent or obsessed in such things and have one goal from the start. Only those of few will able to make a living out of it. Its not reliable career to as much as to be a requirement in school to be. Only to be fixated in such subjects gives you less option of what you want to be, its not as needed in reality so that is why classes such as music, drama, and art be an elective. Students should not be required to take those classes since they will not have as much choice in what they want to be in their life.

1,1565,BC4A0CFD6CAF,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Today, people prefers to interact with technology than people. They can check out books, shops, and play games without speaking to another person. Some people thinks the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have positive effects on peoples lives because technology makes more easy their lives, for example they not need to leave their houses for buy or to joint with another person to play games. However, I think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects because people prefers to shop on online than stores, people use more technology to talk, and also children plays with technology than with another person or toys. Today, people prefers to shop by online than stores. I saw and lived this experience many times about buy by online but I not feel comfortable as a store. Online shops makes feel lazy, alone, and when you have questions obout the product nobody can answer you. I bought by online many times but one day I understand that online shop is not healthy for me because when I go to stores Im practicing my English vocabulary, I walk alot that means that I doing a little exercise, and meet new places and people. Shop by online avoid the human contact and gives negative effects on peoples lives. People use more technology to talk, as facetime, facebook, whatssap or others applicationes. I agree to talk with this aplications with people who lives far away but I prefer to join with my friends or family to talk who lives close. Sometimes, I came out with my sister and their friends who always are in their phones texting or taking pictures. In my personality, use the phone when you are sharing with another person is not respect and you are not enjoying the moment. The use of phones during a meeting avoid the interaction with other human, and gives negative effects on the peoples live. Finally, children more plays with technology than with another child or toys. In the past, children plays with toys or they made their own toys. This helped to children to developed their imagination or decover their skills. Also, children invented plays involving run, saltar or make force; this plays helped to children to enjoy healthy and socialiting with other child. But today, children prefers to play with technology avoing come out and carring to be lazy, obesity, and addicting to the technology. Childrens break times likes to use their phones than talk with their friends or family. They think that interacting with family or friends are old things and that is most enjoy use the phone in their break times. The use of technology for children is a negative affect because they not play or relationing with another people. Today, people use more technology than interact with another person, carring people to complete taks wotout having contact with others. These limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects on peoples lives.",7,7,7,6,6,7,2538,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
2,1566,B18CF330D3CD,"One thing I would like to accomplish is to lose weight for three big reasons. The first big reason is to do it for my health. The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight. The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. I have a saying its ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself. My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self. In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight because its healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem. Losing weight is the one thing I want to do in life and helping others is also something I love doing.",10,9,8,9,8,9,2388,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 10"

4,1568,C8DF8FD0D69D,"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"". -Former British Minister Winston Churchill Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world. These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries. Thats the meaning of this statement and Ill explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase. I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America. Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries. They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes, sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not. Im agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price. I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it.

5,1569,F9C298BF7CE5,"I agree with this prompt that positive attitude is the key to success because, with positive attitude it gets a person where they want to be in life. However with negative attitude you will never get anywhere at all, it will make a person lose confident, also would make you give up right there on the spot which means you gave up your a quitter. Then soon turn into a really bad habit that cant be stopped. Attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect. How can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible thats motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. By doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy. This is why its important just by your attitude can have a huge impact on your success and how you use it is very important. By motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. Its like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. This plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. An example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. I know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that. spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. By boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games theres very little time to accomplish your success before its over and soon to be regretted. Also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. But Mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. When something doesnt go as planned, keep trying bring that positive attitude forward never give up its not too late to change. Taking a test and having it being extremely hard when given negative attuide you will fail and face the consequences but doing the opposite you would be much more relaxed,and will boost that confident up into keep trying because life is full of mistakes you have to push and keep trying now thats what being successful is almost about. Albert enstin did he give up? No right? and look at where hes at he became one of the most successful person ever same with Bill Gates and Mark Zurkrbuirg when you keep going you will see the results so keep pushing and one day I guarantee you will be a great role model or even better. Just remember always keep that positive attuide and keep trying think about the good and not bad and you will have the key to success. learning from your mistakes is another key attuide to have, people have to understand that when you learn its OK to fail and get back up from it thats why you learn from them for a reason. Having positive attitude in life helps you grow as person to understand, and in the long run it will important. When doing so, you will just keep growing,and having good support from yourself or others. think about businesses to be in a business its all about that positive attuide and character thats what makes you learn from your mistakes and to keep growing. In a business theres a lot of ups and downs with negative attuide it will only make it worst but when your in the right state of mind there are choices to make that you might not like but it is part of life,in a business you need to support one another. In conclusion having a positive attitude is the key success in life, without it how will you know what youve accomplished along the way. There are many ways to have a key to success but the most important one is having positive attitude. And this will benefit your life even more,attitude is energy and showing off the wrong kind of energy will be consequences and will not get anyone anywhere in life. This is very important for each an other its not very hard to be positive you just have to be in the right state of mind. This shows how much attitude can really change things it shows how important this is. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

6,1570,281AB73DF311,"The program is good in many ways such as: helping each other with home work, getting to know each other, and also it is lots of fun. Home work can be hard on every student no matter the age. It is a lot better to have someone help you rather than being stuck and angry about the fact you dont get the topic. The older students can help the younger ones with their home work. Most likely they would have already learned the topic. Maybe they could even explain it in a better way for that student. They can all get to know each other. I love meeting older students. I get to ask about what they are learning in school. I could ask about their homework or how their school is like. You could ask them how growing up has changed them. You will be friends and get to know a lot about each other. you may even have a life long friendship in your hands. My last reason is having fun. I am in a program like this myself at my school. I get to in a classroom with high high school students. They are so much FUN! We play together, learn together, and help each other out.

Students can help each other with homework and get to know each other all while having fun. I believe this is a very good program for the good of all students no matter the age or grade.

8,1572,EC8590A774E6,"I think self-esteem comes from real achievement because if youre not doing your best work In class and you feel like its not good enough, and someone tells you what you did wasnt good enough then it will just make you want to do better. On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if youre self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you theyre ugly how will you feel? Of course you will feel some type of way because thats just how the human body works, but you know what? It dont matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what. Dont be something that youre not just because your friend likes you that way, be yourself and if that friend is really your friend he will accept you for who you really are.

10,1574,A9ACA0A6ADE8,"The ancient Greek storyteller Aesop said,""No act of kindness, no matter how small,is ever wasted."" In the futerch there will be more acts of kindness that way we can be happy with one another I hope that I am right about there being more acts of kindness ,but there are not a lot of people who do acts of kindness. I feel that people should do more acts of kindness. If you have time go to a nursing home and bring flowers to the elderly women. You can make a now friend by doing something kind ,or by just being nines to them. We all have to do something for a act of kindness also by doing something like that you feel better about your self before you help someone. Make your friend happy by doing something kind for them because you never know what they are going though. You also never know what someone else is going though ether. I think what the Greek storyteller Aesop is trying to say is just be kind to people. Doing a act of kindness can make someone happy if they had a bad day. For Example,if you help them water there plants you can make them happy. A good way to do a act of kindness is by helping your mom Cooke diner another way you can help is by doing something you dont have to be asked to do. We all have those day were it is just a bad one and you dont want to do any thing well if someone does something for you with them not knowing you had a bad day at school or at work. there should be more people to do something kind to other people.

First impressions are almost impossible to change that is why people always have to worry about their actions because people can not go back the time, can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. First of all, people can not go back the time and try to fix what they had done wrong. For example, some individuals who gave a bad impression in their first time at work because they did not how to deal with the costumer and they had a bad attitude but then the next day they realized that they have to change their attitude it may be too late because the costumers already complained. All in all, people have to do their best the first time even if life is too difficult because time does not come back. In addition, Individuals can lose opportunities by their first impressions. For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities. However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance. Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble. People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time.

In conclusion the first impression its possible to change, because the people can not act how you think they act or they can change the attitude in the future, when i know more about this person my opinion of the first impression change.",6,5,6,5,6,6,3683,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
15,1579,CED4F9C63B9B,"The first impressions are almost impossible to change because when people meet new person, their personal information is only what is she or he looks like, so it is hard to change their first impressions, and people do not often change the first impressions. Firstly, they find the first impressions and guess the person who is she or he because that is what human does every single time when people meet new person. For example, student meets new person who does not look healthy body and the student guess the boy cannot play any sports by seeing his body, but people says that he is the best player on the team. Even if the student watch his game and he plays really good, it is difficult to change the first impressions because he still does not look like athletic person and the student knows how unhealthy he is. Secondly, people do not often change the first impressions because it is individual opinion so they want to keep it in their mind. For example, there is a man who is very shy and show people that he does not want to talk to anyone, so people decide that not to talk to him. Some day, he talks to his friends and find out he loves talking with people. But his first impressions are shy and not talking with anyone so people cannot talk to him because they are not able to change his first impressions. However, some people could change the first impression as long as making a good relationship with a person who talks to. For example, there is a man who is really big and angry face. Everyone afraid of talking to him, but a student tries to talk to him and the student find out he is a nice person to talk. Sometime, people can change their first impression which makes the person feel better so the student can talk to easily. In addition, it could be possible to change the first impression by showing difference between now and before. For example, a student who is being mean to some friends. But some day, the student realize that it is not good to being mean to friends, so he shows the difference which is being nice to friends and helping people instead of being a mean person. Although, the friends change the first impression of the person which makes both of them happier and be able to make better friendship. In spite of these issues, it is still almost impossible to change the first impressions. So everyone should not focus on the first impressions too much.",7,6,6,7,6,8,2846,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

I can fix people if they have any medical problems in life. I was reading books about doctors and I started to get interested becoming one. Being a doctor is alot of hard work, I love doing hard work because hard work makes you pay off. My parents told me dont do something what you think its fun, do something what you love, what I want to do and love to do in life is to become a doctor. I sometimes mainly do hard work because of money, one of my main goals is to get alot of money. I need money to buy a house, have children, and taking care of my family. Doctors get alot of money when they do hard work, its not easy to become one. Hard work makes you feel tired, but at the same time you relax and get alot of money. Money is not important in life, when you have alot of money, the first thing I think about is family first, then I think anything I want on the second thought. My uncle is a doctor, I learn alot from him how you become a doctor. He told me to read some of the doctor books at this age and then when I get to my senior year, thats when he told me to think about becoming a doctor. How my uncle become a doctor is he going to medical school for 7-8 years, but I want to be different from him, I want to become a surgeon and a doctor. My uncle is just a doctor, but he still works for surgeons but dosent do actual surgery to people. My uncle was the one who got me most interested becoming a doctor. I would mostly become a surgeon than a doctor because I read mostly about surgeries and it get me even more interested. Surgery is not that disgusting when you get used to it, thats why I read alot of surgeon books. When I first thought of surgery, I thought it was really disgusting, but then my uncle told me alot about it, then I stopped the disgusting part. My favorite part about surgery is fixing people, I feel happy that im fixing the person. The main reason why I want to become a surgeon is because I want to get alot of money to take care of my family, and I want to help people in life.

17,1581,B54DBEF87F11,"One day Generic_Namehad to go somewhere important with his family, but the problem was that he also had school to attend to. So he decided to do a video chat with his class, so he didnt he didnt have to miss anything from school. Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them. First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and dont want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You cant miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and thats your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities. Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year thats when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or dont have a ride and you cant get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you dont understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you dont feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who dont know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them. Lastly, some people dont want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they dont want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they dont do anything because they think that they dont have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they wont miss that much work. Thats why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you dont miss anything or be left behind. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are many reasons why students should take the benificial of doing stuff like that because they have responsibilities and also have a future ahead of them.

I agree with what the scientist Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more. To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it. Also you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw. Finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you I think Im an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when Im thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of thing and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it. In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you dont have imagination you wont see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.",7,5,7,6,6,7,3894,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
20,1584,B744CD534ADB,"Dears, teachers of Generic_School. First, I think that we all should work alone, because each student can be working for their self with out any other help from students that do not care about their projects or homework, all students has different ideas, working in a group would be more stressed for the student, they may not have the opportunity to show their own ideas working in a group. However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic. In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said dont ask me, thats not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasnt nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, thats one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group. Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. Some people said that working in a group its more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination. In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work. Finally, students can work for their self, and is not always necessary to work in group, sometimes work in group can be annoying and distractive by others students.",8,6,7,6,5,7,2464,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
21,1585,10D0BBF44479,"I believe that we have to work for our goals, and also we have to focus in what we want in our life. and that is true that we accomplish more if we are always doing something, because we maintain our mind occupied in our goals or what we want to be, we could accomplish more things if we focus in our goals and dont waste our time doing other stuff. For example: In our school we can do awesome things with hard work or if we try to concentrate just in our goals. that is get good grade, and graduate and if we keep doing good job in school we can accomplish many great things. like if we get a good career we can get good money and we can enjoy life because we are doing the things that we like not just a simple job. Another example: Once we decide what our goal is we maintain our mind occupied in our goal and work hard to get there, or to accomplish that we really want, and not matter how hard it is we can do it. because it what we want to be, is what we like, and also is to get a good future and a good life, like if we get a good job we can get good money and we dont have to worried about that and just enjoy life and try to work hard everyday. Another reason that why I think we have to maintain our self doing something we like. is because we can get trouble to accomplish want we want. like we can do drugs and drink alcohol and all that kind of stuff and I think that is bad for our life because that interrupt our way and we get distracted and loss our path and our faith for our self because for just one mistake we can loss all the think that we had worked for. and I think we have to focus if we really what to be a professional person of if we want to be someone in the future. In the other hand other people think that inactivity also serve a purpose like we can live our life no matter if we do something, or not like if we dont work hard for our goals its fine, and some people say that what happen in your life is for a reason or like is your destiny. but i think that they are wrong because we can decide what we going to be in our life, thats why God left us the free will to have the opportunity to choose what we going to fight for, and make a decision that going to help us to accomplish whatever we want in this life. In conclusion I believe that we can accomplish many awesome and great things if we work hard for our goals and maintain our mind doing something good and something that we love like in our jobs, our school, our career etc. also if we maintain our mind occupied in something productive at the same we win something because its help our life and also we have to be careful to dont get distracted for others bad things like drugs, alcohol etc. I believe we have to take care to our life like a treasure because this life is what God give us and we have to be careful the decision we take and if we get wrong we can learn from our mistake, and I think is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing something that we like.

Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work. Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active. Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing.

I think food that contains too much oil makes you get sick and thats what we have right now, but others think different and they have their reasons too. Although some say that the schools cafeteria should not change their food because the food that they are offering right now is especially made to make students work better actually, the schools cafeteria should change their food because it gives students more variation to eat and by having a healthier food less students will get sick. Those who think that the schools cafeteria should not change their food have their reasons. One reason is that the food that they are offering makes students work better; this is because it has a lot of oil. Scientific studies say that oil awake people, and make people do their usually activies better. Also, students who have their test after lunch, and they have eat something that contains a lot of oil; they tend to get better scores than those who didnt eat at lunch; this might be because some of them cant think with the stomach empty, or it can be because oil really helps them concentrate, who knows right. The oil food doesnt sound that bad, isnt? but I will tell you next what is what I think that is bad about it. There are many people who think that the schools cafeteria should change their food. This is because they have their reasons, one reason is to make students eat healthier; this will help prevent students get sick. There are many sicknesses caused by oil, and one of them is cholesterol; cholesterol can kill people if you dont know how to take care of it. Also, by preventing students get sick they will not lose any day of school, and that will help them have good attendance and they will not get lost in their important classes. For example: Science, Math and History. Another reason to change the cafeterias food is that it will give more variation for students to eat. This might sound simple, but by giving them more variation to eat; students will feel more free to explore food that they dont know. Also, students will feel more comfortable as if they were at home because you know that when you are at home food variate and that makes it fun. moreover, Variation of food will attract those who are more likely to stay out of the cafeteria; maybe they dont like the food that we have right now, and they are hoping that the cafeteria change the food. I think that by changing the food in the cafeteria will make a good impact in the school. In conclusion, I think that the principal of my school should change the cafeterias food because the variation of food will make a good impact in students who dont like to eat at lucn right now, and it will also prevent the majority of students to get sick. Eventhough those who dont want to change the food had a good reasons; ""The food that we have right now is made to make students be more active"". I think that the reasons to change the food are more productive for the improvement of our school. ",7,6,6,6,7,6,3581,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
29,1593,CF453C152FD5,"This is an easy choice technology has a negative affect on people. There are many reason why but three big ones are. one you lose a lot of communication skills. another is you only see things through your phone. And finally you lose family time or time with friends . The first reason is people lose communication skills. such as you dont see people face to face you are just texting them and you dont know how to talk to them in person so you dont hang out with them you just text them. and they pretty much just a become and online friend. another example of this is during a job interview you dont know how to talk to someone. its really hard to do stuff when someone doesnt have communication skills. and you can get food online so you wont have to talk to people. most people just see things and hear about stuff thats happening. dont go and explore or experience thing the just go on the Internet. because everything around us is technology based. you cant go anywhere without the internet or a TV. so everyone has gotten used to that so they dont have a need to go out or play outside if they have games on there phone,computer,iPad. so people dont have to travel because you can face time people or use other apps to see people. you can order food from uber eats so you dont have to leave your house and people wont know how it feel to be in a restaurant. finally people wont be spending time with family because of the internet. because someone could be watching a YouTube video and then another then after a while it could be dark outside and you just lost the day and havent said anything to your parents because you have been watching YouTube or Netflix. people get used to that life style and a lot people wont change because its become a habit and its a bad habit to over come. people also forget about there friends because they just wanna be on there phone alone watching videos,playing games , watching TV. and you forget about family and friends not on purpose and you still do it without knowing. And its not just kids its also adults. They pay everything online so they only leave for work and nothing else. then come back order food or get groceries online. and cook while watching TV or on Facebook .",6,4,6,6,6,5,2856,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
30,1594,A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them. However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone arent truely who they are. The person can be good looking person youve ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them. Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you. Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you. Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are. ",8,7,7,8,7,8,2150,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
31,1595,16DEF72E220A,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But I dont think that it would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because, there are many reasons that the students could not able to learn home by yourself in online; which are that some problems, and communicating. Also there are more position to I disagree and agree with this argument. Firstable, I think the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, it would not benefit for the studehts, because of the students could have some question that they dont know. And if someone who dont teach with them, they cannot learn that more understable. And they migth cannot catch up their late works, because of they dont help anybody. I have an examples of that the girl who has taken an online classes, and she didnt go to the school, because she thought, the online class is better than to learn subjects and it doesnt have to do that everyday and she can study her subject whenever day she could. But she have to her exam in the school, and she didnt study as well as cant catch up her study work. Now she stopped to take an online class in the home and go to school. So, in my opinion, even thought the online class is giving you as more free time but if you cant study by yourself, It couldnt help you that learn. Also, the students cant communicate with other students. It means that the student cant study with other students that they cant make some friends and could not be an active just like some other students. Also, it will be impact their behaviour that theyll be more lonely. Because the students behaivior is always changing and easy to get used to their environment, especially the high school students. Therefore, i disagree to attend classes from home by way of the online and video conferencing benefit for the students. On the other hand, the online class is not really useless thing that for the students. Of course, It should be has some advantegious way to attend online and video class, which are it helps that the students could be more mature and more focusing on their work. And they have more free time because the student doesnt have to this everyday as a school, they can do that whatever time to working on it. So, we dont have to hold one point of view, we should try that two other sides. For examples, the every students are different way to study, we dont have to demand to do only one way, they might be more interest with the online, video class and the other students could be more enjoy to attend this class. Consequently, every students who enjoy that much, they could take that class much easily to study in their home. In conclusion, I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, but not all of students, because they all have a different way to study and somehow the student will need some help to support their what they are studying. In that case, students might be trying to give up to study alone. Therefore, the student might think very well to thier option to to attend classes from the home.

It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Students should be commit to a career at a young age because it helps students to develop more and it allows a lot of opportunity for many students. First, start a career at a young age its important for students because it would helps to develop more. For example, sometimes students choose to do other stuff instead do work. Some students really want to success and get everything in life. Students would always like to have good future over everything. If students commit to a career at a young age, they would be develop in different ways. For example, students would have more stuff to do, more homework. Their mind would be thinking about stuff for their careers. They going to take things more serious for their life. Secondly, start a career at a young age its important for students because it allows a lot of opportunity.

That the enthusiasm is it the most important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word. First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can reading the message. So if who read the prompt may perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the futere business can thinking about it.

First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That means you will have the same situation going to failure in your live.

I been doing it seens I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports. The first one I learned is soccer because its just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isnt big as well know as it should be. In the middle east its big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot. The second one I learned was track it wasnt that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump its like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite its not about beating the other person. The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion]. In my school they have one for girls and one for boys but a lot of people come watch he boys one way more than the girls. The next one is softball this one I just wanted to do something different when the other seasons are over. It was boring at first when you learn how to play it becomes a game not a sport. In school we have softball but we dont have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they dont.

There can be a chance where the older students can teach younger students how to help others as well for example Pick up someone else stuff if it fell on the floor Help an old person cross the road Teach kids how to write neatly This kind of program could help the environment so much. The students can also travel around the world to help younger students in other countries for example United Kingdom Norway Sweden Denmark Canada And more! Having this type of need and help could this world so much. It helps across the country, around the world, all types of students can help others younger students how to live their lives, it can help go to collage and get a job that their very great at and in their job they can learn as well, it can make them get a talent from their job so they can learn how to do stuff in their jobs and become very good at. So yes I would recommend for the older students to help younger students (even around the world) how to live their normal lives. It can help so much for others and it teaches respect and thats why in every school they should have older students helping younger students and in other countries they should also have older students help younger students how to live normal lives and have a great future and they can also help their families and other families.

The students required of many classes to accomplish their knowledge, but some people think that students need to take a music, drama,or an art class because: I think that students will need those classes to graduate. To get school diploma students will have to accomplish some classes like music,drama,or an art class. they should use those classes for distraction their mind to the other classes for examples math, history and science class then, they will get relaxation. Also, I think that some people wants the students take those classes because those classes represent happiness, peace and an individual talent that every person have. but some people get frustrated that they don not have any talent like sing, act or draw. Some people want that the students take those classes because they need to develop their mind in something productive for the society and for them. No think in bad things or bad actions. Also,I think that some people think that students should be take a music,drama,or art class because students have the potential to protrude in the great music,drama and art world. To prove to the society the capacity that they may have and that they are the future. They will replace the people that do music drama and art in our present for example artists,painters and others. I think that some people believe that students should be take music,drama and art classes because is the only way to develop their mind,knowledge and to learn new things that help them for the future. Those classes help the students to get a mental and physical develop because the music make us to express feelings,emotions,or give to the audience a message that we want that they know and understand. The drama help us to develop our mind,but also,help us to use our body to express something that we want that people will know. The art class help us to represent,express and get abilities that students will do not know that they have. With those classes students will be exactly what they are and feel because they will express anything that they may want without get frustrated. In conclusion some people believes that students should be take music,drama,an art class because they need new persons that express and give to them that knowledge that represent those classes because those students that will learn are the future and are the new generation. Also, because students need express feelings,emotions and develop their knowledge. Because they think that the students are interesting in others things that is not productive and they need to learn those important topic to not be loss and continue with the music, drama and art in our world.

I also dont think we should extend the time because we will be getting out of school later. If we we extend the time then we could be very exhausted during the school day. This could also be very difficult for the bus drivers because they will be getting home extremely late and it will be dark when they are driving the kids home back from school. We get enough time in school already so there is no need to add more time the the school day. We learn enough in every class, and we learn everthing that we need to learn in that hour and a half. We learn what we have to learn and if we add time the the teachers wont really know what to do. I think we understand that they are saying and we understand the concept they are teaching us. The school day would be way longer for elementrary kids. I dont think its fair for elementray because they stay in their classes the entire day . It would be very broring because they are going to be sitting there for eight and a half hour. It would be very broing for them, because they dont get to switch classes like middle and highschool. They should also have some fun during the school day they shouldnt just sit there and high school and middle school at least get to move around while they are switching classes. They really cant do anything after school is done. If we extend the time in school we will be at school later. Kids will be tired the next day because they wont get home until the evening. They wont pay attention to class because they didnt get enough sleep and they will not be paying close attention to what the teacher is saying because the class it too long. We will also be getting home late. Elementray kids will be getting home around 5:00pm. They wont be able to do many activities after school because they are getting home late. When they get home they will have to eat, shower, and go to sleep because they have school the next day and they deserve some fun. High school kids wake up around 5:00am and they will be at school for eight hours and then they wiil go home and do their homework. They will be tired because they dont get enough sleep and they have to wake up very early. They also cant do activities because of the homework they have and how early they have to wake up and the time they get out of school. They will get home late and they cant do much because they will have to focus on homework and school. Extending the time could be harder for bus drivers. Bus drivers need enough sleep so that they can drive the students safely to school. Sleep is the most important and you should get at least eight hours of sleep, and that cant be possible for bus drivers because they will get home late. They all need to rest good so that they can be wide awake. If they dont get enough sleep this could lead to crashes. Crashes could happen if its too dark and the bus drivers cant see outside. Elementray students would be getting out out around 5:00pm and around that time it will start to get dark and it isnt good for bus drivers, because they cant see if they are somewhere very dark. They also wont get to see their family as much anymore and spend time with them. They need to spend time with their family it is important to spend time with them. If they get home around eight then they will get to spend very little time with them. They have to go to sleep early because they need to wake up on time. Crashes arent good because the parents can sue the county and that will be the countys fault because it was dark outside and maybe the bus driver couldnt really see outside. I dissagree with adding one and a half hour to the school day. I think seven hours is enough time for a school day and to learn all the materials that we nned to know.

49,1613,6712BD512DB7,"I agreed that the greater of us lies and not in setting our aim high or low, but setting our aim too low will achieve our mark because many people around us are down and falling for some reasons. But, they are trying their best to climb up to the top in order to achieve their goals and learning from their mistakes. However, many others are lying or cheating to get a better score and failing down slowly. In fact, many people are working-hard to accomplish the goal that they want to achieve. Setting our aim too low will achieve our goals because people have a weakness in their job and thats the reason why that they should be trying their best to fix their mistakes. I used to failed my math class last year because I didnt understand the unit because its was too hard for me. So, I started to stay after school with my teacher and asking questions because I want to make sure that I understand the lesson. However, that didnt work out a lot as I expected because the assignment was different from what my teacher was explaining to me. But, I did not give up yet so I decided to study more at home and do some research about the lesson. And I finally understood the lesson. No matter how hard the work is, but whats important is that I put my time and efforts on it. Another reason why setting our aim too low will help us achieve the goal is that by trying your best and work hard for it in order to achieve. However, many people are cheating to get the their goal so easily. My best friend got a high score on the test because he cheated and the test was hard as well. The teacher was wondered how did he got a high school on the test because he was the only one who got the highest score in the class, then he lied to my teacher that he studied a lot last night. But, the teacher caught him cheated on the test by using the notes because his answers was exactly as the notes said. So, its not a shame that you are failing at something; but, its a more worst that you lie to people and start falling down. Also, setting our aim low will help us achieve the goal because many people are working-hard to get what they want. During the summer break, I told my mom that I want a new computer because my old computer is glitching and broken down a lot. Then, she told me that I work to earn money and get the new computer. She also said that it will helps me learn more things about the world. So, I started to work at a small restaurant and my position was cashier. It helps me counting the money faster and also it helps me improve my positives toward the other people. Many people disagreed that setting our aim low wont help us to achieve our goal because sometime lying could be good for some reason and achieve the goal very easy. However, once the people find out that youre lying to them then you know the consequences. Sometime people starting at the lowest score to the highest score because they are doing their best of abilities to get the what they wanted to. In conclusion, starting at the lowest point to the highest point will help you figure out what you need to do or learn in order to reach the goal. For example, if you dont try your best to achieve your goal and its the worst thing that you couldve ever done. However, the other are spreading lies to people how they achieve their goal easily and convincing people to be like them. But, keep trying your best and never give up to achieve your goal; then, you can get what you want.",7,8,7,8,7,7,1341,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
50,1614,3A94013B23DD,"""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" a quote from Thomas Jefferson, meaning the more active we are, the more we are able to accomplish. Although many would believe being active would be the obvious answer, there are reasons as to why being inactive may allow us to achieve more. By being inactive, we have plenty of time on our hands to accomplish things, we have the energy to accomplish more, rather than constantly being worked up and doing something, and we also have time to brainstorm ideas. Constantly doing something does not give us the time we need to accomplish goals. By always have a fixed schedule or always having to do something, we feel as though we connot risk wasting any time by trying to achieve something. Having those few extra minutes out of the day can allow us to create or focus on our hobbies, which then can get us to accomplish things. For example, over the summer, my dad decided to take time out of his job to focus on his love for plants. He then decided to make it his goal to bulid a garden, by taking time out of his very fixed work schedule to do it. By the end on the summer, he had accomplished his goal; just from taking some time off. Always doing something causes us to lack the energy we need to accomplish things. When constantly doing things and working, we are too tired to achieve anything, because we put all our energy into everthing else we do. We become fatigue and restless when constantly doing something. For example, my mother is always doing something; she goes to class, goes to work, then comes home to clean and cook. She is never able to accomplish anything because she does not have enough energy. When we constantly work, all we want to do after is sleep, rather than causing us to want to accomplish things. By not always having to do things, we are able to new brainstorm ideas. We can brainstorm goals that we would like to accomplish. When always doing something our minds are focused on other things, rather than focusing on acheiving goals. We dont have time to sit and brainstorm when we are constantly working. Our minds cannot focus on multiple things at once, meaning it does not have space for other thoughts of accomplishments. Even though many people think that constantly being active helps accomplish more, it is not always true. We can accomplish just as much, or even more when being inactive than always doing something. By being inactive we have the time to accomplish things, we have the energy to achieve more goals, rathan than being tired and restless, and we are able to brainstorm ideas without other thoughts in our minds to distract us.",8,7,9,7,7,8,759,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
51,1615,24B8DF4DA85A,"Be active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life. First of all, in reality things cant be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success. In addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them. For example, the best basketball player of all time wouldnt have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didnt do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now. Perhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive. Some people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesnt mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things constantly and dont give up. Without dedication and work people wont accomplish nothing, no matter the talent or the skills that they might have if they dont do nothing with it. People must stay active and fight for what they wish and want, without that life wont take you anywhere.",9,7,7,8,7,7,483,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
52,1616,3651697D855B,"FAILURE PLAYS IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCCESS. I agree with the statement by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The word ""failure"" is been pictured as been a disapointment to family, friends or to oneself. Mostimes,everybody wants to succed in anything they do, but faces some challenges at the process to acheive that expected goal. This challenges are not necessarily proposed to affect you in a bad way, but sets a room for improvement and perfection. Failure brings a feeling of confidence to a person, working on a project for a long time and fixing mistakes you came across. Makes an individual confident,understanding everything that concern that work and feeling more relaxed doing it without so much anxiety. Mr Rubio, was told to come up with an Architectural plan for a building close to a water fall. Rubio knew this project was close to impossible for him to complete this task, but he accepted it and started making the building plan. After he taught he came up with a suitable plan for the building, it got rejected by the state building commitee, because they asked him why certain things were placed this way and he couldnt answer effectively . He had to go back and identify hes faults in the building plan, and come up with a bettter one. Rubio had sleepless nights, communicating with various Architects and Civil enginers to get some idea on hes work. When Rubio was convinced he was ready to take the project to the board meeting he felt confident in himself and knew he could explain evrything corncernig hes building plan to the comitee. When he turned in the drawing, and was asked some certain questions he quickly answerd them with absolute confidence and got approved. Secondly, the more you face challenges life throws at you makes you stronger. If everything in the world moved in a positive way we wont invent things inorder to satisfy our human needs. Isaac Newton and other scientst encounterd a problem and decided to solve this problems by making inventions. So work could be done faster, reduce Man power and done more effectively. Before isaac Newton got the light bulb to work , he failed ninety nine times of hes experiment. This failures didnt stop him from acheiving hes goal, he kept on striving hard making research and later came up with a long lasting light bulb. Which helps us see clearly in a dark place. Although it takes time, to achieve this goals after failing. Most people would get frustrateed and quit, there is an old saying ""nothing good comes easy"". To achieve whatever you desire in life, you have to be ready to encounter difficulties and failure, but approching this problems knowing that you are going to get better it just takes time and patience. After acheiving this goals what would be seen is your acomplishments rather than your failures. ",7,6,8,7,6,7,707,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
53,1617,6D8B9B8431A6,"It has been said that working with a group benefit more than working alone because it can be more fun. Have you ever been in a situation where you feel alone and you dont want to do any homework. I agree that working with teammates can help us feel better and they push us to be better . Although some say working alone is beneficial because we dont waste our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information and work fast. Some say that working alone is beneficial because we dont waste our time. Working alone can save our time because we can work at home, we dont need to wait for the rest of the group or even go somewhere else. For example, last year, my Science teacher gave us a group assignment where we needed to meet each other outside of school. That day my group and I talked where to see each other, then we went to Generic_Names house. We enjoyed talking and eating but we never talked about the project. All I can say, we all just waste our time. However, working with a group is more beneficial because we can share information. It is true that many heads think better than one because if one comes with an idea then all together discuss about it. Furthermore, some child think better if one person gives them an idea. For example, before doing a class work I always have to ask my teacher if what Im thinking is correct because my mind gets freeze out. Working alone doesnt help in answering doubt that we could have. Also, working with a group is a great benefit because we can work fast. All the group can work at the same time, some can do the posters, others can look for information, and the rest can divide the information about what theme each one is going to talk during the presentation. A survey showed that a faster way to work is working in groups because all the team can work in different areas at the same time. It means that working with a group is a great benefit, it help us to have better thoughts. Working with a group can bring joy to our soul by making new friends. We can work and have fun, also working with a team is great because we can talk not just about the project, but our lives. Moreover, a group work can make learning more passionate. In conclusion, working alone is beneficial because it can save our time, actually working with a group is more beneficial because all the group can share information and that can bring a faster work.

54,1618,F45967CEFA55,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that youll have more of enthusiasm when youre find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals. I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchills quote, yet some people think its something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it. First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when theyve failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning. Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didnt fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didnt work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success. Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It dont matter what others may think of it or if youll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure dont stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. Youll reach higher goals with higher potential then what youll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world. In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success its the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",8,6,8,7,6,6,3623,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Having a positive attitude will give allow you to have a good days. Others may think you do not have to have a positive attitude in order to be successful. Having a positive mindset will always help you get better opportunities, for example to get a better job or a better home or a better car, but everything requires that you have a positive mindset. Also having a positive mind will always help you to be better every day every time you overcome a bad situation you will become stronger or also every time you reach a goal, that will help you be better. Sometimes it is also necessary to be negative to understand or experience bad things or it can also help you be prepared for bad things, or also bad news or bad times. We have to try to be positive most of the time to be able to make good decisions and have better opportunities, but also being negative can help us make better decisions for ourselves. Different from how I think, people say if you are smart, why do I need a positive attitude? They believe someone can be successful just knowing the skills. There are those that believe if, you work harden than most you can be successful. In closing, it is my belief if you have a positive attitude you will have a successful and rewarding life.

57,1621,E566F0D20F98,"I dont think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldnt have the chance to experience what it would be like in school. If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online. Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you cant do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you cant at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you cant at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldnt you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes its a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also its boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers. I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they cant keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally dont think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what its like. Therefor I dont think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers. Maybe even discover what they are good and take that for their future. ",8,6,7,7,6,7,3313,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

62,1626,85D3E5A1D64E,"Students chould not be required to take a music, a drama or an art class. Student should only be required to take classes that they actually need. Having to take those classes just adds classes you need to graduate. It is also all a waist of time if the students are not actually in to it. Firstly, these classes are just extra classes that we dont really need. In my opnion, I believe that student should be able to graduate highschool with the classes they need. English, Math, History and Science are all classes that can support them when they go to college. If student dont take these classes they may also graduate ealier then they are supposed to. For example, I go to a highschool where I get the credits I need and I am able to graduate a year earlier. Which I think everyone should have the chance too. Lastly, if a student is not interested in one of these classes they wont try. Even if they do try and fail then its just holding them back. They will start stressing over it when they wont actually end up needing it. Student will also consume most of their time bringing up their grade in these classes that they will not work on other classes. Then they will end up failing. On the other hand, some might say these classes should be required because student might find interest in one of those and would like to persue it after graduating. I think that if a student is interested then they should be allowed to take the class of your choice. However, if your not then you should not be pushed to take them when you dont want to. In conclusion, student should not be forced to take elcective classes. If they want to they should but if not then they shouldnt need it to graduate. Electives are just extra classes needed to graduate and they also have no pont if the student are not actually interested. po p",7,6,7,6,7,8,1768,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

64,1628,EA40087521CC,"Failure is a dreaded thing in our daily life what we try to avoid. A lot of people trying to not get in any situation where they can fail, and just a lesser layer of the people want to face with them. Those people find it as a learning process and they a make great outcomes from they life. Fear controlls every aspect of our life. How do we looks like? Did we made the right decission? In most cases we fear about failure because we are not sure about the success or a positive outcome of the situation and the consequences of our actions. This idea divide peoples minds to two sides, two ideology: shy, safety player and brave, risk taker. Both sides have pros and cons. Those who chose the safety game, are using they background knowledge what they learned for long years and made it highly sure to not fail it. The word shy is not the best representation for them just in that case when something new and unknown came in to learn. They dont take the risk to fail it and they obviously will not fail because they will not even try. That can be any situation like answer the question in class; try out a sport; go to the gym; wear a new cloth; ect. The only thing what is make a gate between them and to try it is the fear. They dont take the risk and they will never know the outcome. If its a fail then they take it as a lose. Maybe the only thing what is a benefit in their thinking they will really not going to lose anything but then the successes will come lesser. Also that doesnt mean they are not risk takers or they live in constant fear, its just more safer. The cases where they are need to take steps can be not that scarry or its doesnt need to be a big deal. These type of people are already made mistakes and the reason why then fear to try it again the previous experiences. Said something dumb in class and everyone laughted; tried a sport be he/she was not succes at all; in the gym he/she felt unconfortable because he/she was not that strong like the people around them, ect. On the other side those people who trying out new thigs and got experience are usually the ones who make something in their lives what will stand for them after time. Great example for this is the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill itself. His life shows the importance of trying. If we just think about how he becamed a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, its easy to realize it was not always easy for him. Biography of his life tells us how many times he tried and failed but even through he gained success. People like Churchill are thinkers and they take the failures as a lessons of the life. For them is a learning process of making an idea perfect; make an action successful; decide a the right way; answer a question rightfully. If a fail cames up after a wrong move they face with it and they are most importantly proud of it. Not proud about what they failed, about the correction, the knowledge what they gained and driving them to avoid the same and similar fails. Yes they can make the same mistake again but at the end they will be the winners. And this is the point where the enthusiasm came in. People are trying to reach their goals and enthusiasm drives them. Winston Churchill won the World War II because his goal was to not fail his people, the mankind, and everything what he built. Enthusiasm can have different faces like duty as a president, joy like an istrument player, or to bring happyness like a parent. To keep the enthusiasm is depending on the person. The goal what is requires it can be lesser, greater, midling, makes no difference. The person who keeping it is matters, not the size of the goal because anyone can be a president if he/she really wants it but cannot go to the gym a few times a week if he/she is lazy and dont have enough willingness in their heart. That is a close connection with our life goals. Doesnt matters if its short or long tearm goals. That enthusiasm can broke after fails or can be even stronger than before. My example is with the martial art also an example for this. I learned how to dual wield the nunchaku and the learning process was painfull. Im right handed and to learn, just to spin it, with my left hand hurted me. I was hitting my forearm thousand times. My skin was red after an hour of practice. People asked me why do I still trying and why do I dont stay down. The reason why I didnt stoped was my enthusiasm in my goal to master the nunchaku. After months of practice I did it successfully and in these days Im not a master yet but at least I cannot hit myself. A lot of people who going to failure to failure are also taking a risk to fail to the point where they cant try it again. That means a fail where a people can die. These are specific cases but not just death can stop us. Also there are situations where a person just become unable to do thing what he/she did before. And yes there also situations after tragedies where we can stand up stronger than before. There was a boy who loved to ride his bicycle and do tricks with it. One day he had an accident with it in a car crash and he lost his leg. He was in wheelchair for months but doctors offered him a chance to make him a plastic leg. He spent a lot of time in recovery and when he was able to move by himself he wanted to return to his dream. For a lot of time he failed to do anything with his bike. He was angry and broken. But he didnt gave up. After failing again and again he finally on his bike again. In these day he riding like before the accident because he never give up. His strory is inspire me. I agree with Winston Churchill. We need to fail to learn and enyoj what we reach. We need to try and train not till we can get it right, till we cant get it wrong. And we need a goal to be enthusiastic and to never lose it, to make it stronger after every fail. We can stay in our comfort zones and try to avoid the fails or we can face with them and get experience.

I believe its important to get peoples opinions on this question because i think Albert Einstein would be curious about what people think. Once they have chose what they chose they could talk about it, give each other some details, also communicate with another, ask questions on to why they chose what they chose. I disagree wit Albert Einstein because imagination is something you imagine in your head or dreams it can be real only sometimes. I agree with knowledge because it happens in real life and when you do something you have the knowledge to know it right away. Students use their knowledge in school to learn about English. In school i use my knowledge by reading books and by reading i can understand what the book is talking about and i will know how i will write a short summary of the book. My second detail is i can use my knowledge in soccer because i can learn new skills and read a book all about soccer and i can understand that i can use my knowledge by knowing what reading is. Imagination wouldnt be more important than knowledge because the things that you will imagine probably wont come to real life. Imagination isnt a smart way to use the word important because it wont really help students, maybe even adults. Knowledge i know that its a smart way to say important because it does help students in school, sports, maybe even with some decisions they will make in life. Albert Einstein probably asked us to agree or disagree with him because he wants to know what are thoughts are and would want students, adults, teachers to communicate with each other and talk about why they agreed or disagreed with him. In my conclusion i think students can succed in life using knowledge because its a smart decision to make in life by just thinking if its a good or bad idea your knowledge could help make that good decision for you",6,6,7,6,7,7,3857,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

And when you disrespect your teacher they will call security on you and they will come and get you and tall to you. And if you get in a fight with a student then you will be in a big trouble the security will come and get you and it its really bad they will call an ambles and this time the principle and the police and parents will get involved and the other person parents might press charges and that would not be good for you on your reared beauty when you apply for coleg they will see that you had a bad history and they wont want that tiyp of beaver in their school so you would be hurting your fucher.

And technology will hurt many people. First of all, Technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. Since, I was in Generic_City, I forgot my phone to bring outside. And I was doing nothing that day. I thought I have to focus my life without technology. We can do many things without technology.

Also, technology will be my life controller. Second reason is if we are in the house, we didnt do any communicate with family.

It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall. The days will be shorter since the school year is longer. I believe not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break. It will be easier for people to hold the information when they return in the fall. A large amount of people forget what they learn in school when they return from the 3 months of summer break. Everytime summer break comes I forget mostly all the information information I learned, it just leaves my head over those months. When we get 3-4 weeks over summer break, not all the information will leave. It will be easier for us students to not forget what we learned over the months. School days will be shorter since the school year is longer or we can have one weekday off and have school at a regular time. They can change it so students dont have to wake early in the morning. Some people cant wake up early and some people get off work late and have school the next day. Students can have one weekday off, like a Wensesday or Friday off. It will give them time to relax and stay focus on school. Since, the school days are shorter, they can have time to theirselfs and not be stressed. I believe not everyone has something to do over the three months of summer break. They might just do something for one month and for the another two months might not do anything. They might just stay inside and play video games all day and not read or not pick up a book the whole break. They might not even exercise all day. Students need to have something to do over the breaks, so they can keep learning. Sometime I believe its a bad idea. Students will stay a school the whole year until they gradute, and they need to spend time with their family. Some students dont really like school and they will get too stressed and breakdown over the year, so they need a long break from school. Students need time for theirselfs, so they dont stress as much. Students will stress over too much work and they have after school jobs, so they cant do their homework.

71,1635,1FB89CF59E5B,"Influence can be divided in words, actions, and motivation. Words can give a individual influence. Actions can give a example of what to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it. Motivation has a impact in peoples life that can demonstrate influence to others. Some people say that giving a example is the only way to demonstrate influence. By analyzing each paragraph the reader will have a summery about how a example is not the only way to influence people. Word can give a excellent influence. Many people tend to hear what other influences say. For example a YouTuber called Alpha M teaches young men, or older men to be more succefull. If Alpha M does not have his charismatic character to talk, then many of his public would not listen to what he says. Words can dictate influence if the person knows what is he or she saying. Not only words is a key, but is a fundamental key. Action is a important key to demonstrate influence in peoples life. Actions tell in a non verbal way how to do certain things in life. For example, Messi, a really famous soccer player, has played soccer since he was 9 years old. His talent has influence many people to be better in sports, and to be better in life. If Leonel Messi did not had the talent to play soccer, then his influence would be less or non. Actions can tell what to do, when to do it, and/or, how to do it. By analyzing actions the reader can tell that actions is a important key, but motivation can give influence to. Motivation can do many things for influence. It demonstrates character, responsibility, and success and thats what people most want to follow, more in this days. Generic_Name, a police officer, has demonstrated a lot of responsibility in many times. He has been rewarded many times because of his excellent work, and his motivation. His motivation has influenced many people to obey the laws, and to be better in society. If Generic_Names motivation was not good, then many people would not obey the laws. Motivation can make millions of people to be influenced by one person. Motivation is a key, but some people say something else. Some people say that giving a example to society is the only way to influence people. Words, actions, and motivation can give a person influence to follow them or motivate them to do something. By giving a example the person is only influencing people in one way. In particular, a teacher from Generic_school tells students to not use their cellphones during class period, even though he gives the example of not using his cellphone, many students still use their device. If the teacher had giving the students the words, actions, and motivation, then the students would be influenced by the teachers order. Giving a example is part of influencing others. After reading each paragraph, the reader can have a conclusion that a example is not the only way to influence others in society. A individuals influence can be based by words . What to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it can give example of actions, which gives influence. A individuals motivation can demonstrate influence to others and have a impact in peoples life. Some people say that to demonstrate influence, the only thing to do is by giving a example. Words, actions, and motivation are three key factors that can give a person many influence around the world. Not only giving a example, but having this three qualities is important to have influence.

If students may allow to use cell phone then they can distortion by study, and their force can be in phone. When we keep use phone then we cant listen what teacher saying. For explain, last year in my histroy class we can allow to use phone so, when go to histroy class I alway usemy phone and i never listen to teacher. I fail the class and sol because of use cell phone everyday. School may not be allow to use cell phone in classroom because if school allow to use cell phone in classroom then students may not be able to learn anything.

74,1638,9CB6D9467227,"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesnt mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key. First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and Im convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that arent related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once Im determined and make that my main focus, then Itll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal. Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if I dont believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for. Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then thats one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I wont give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority. Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think its a huge difference when you do because thats peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! ",5,8,7,6,7,6,2089,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 5"

Students might change their minds of playing around in school from visiting this type of job students will see people working hard and fast every single day and getting paid a small amount so students would not want to be working at a place like that in there future so it could pursue them to start putting more effort in school and not to play around in class, and have a successful job. Some parents dont have money to put their child in school Furthermore there are going to have to work at a hard working job but students dont have to because you have a chance and you got your education so it might teach students to take this advantage to have a success job and not to play around on the other hand teens that dont get their education will work at a place that pay a small amount. If students dont take their education serious your parents paid the money for your education and if you just dont pay attention and not try the money your parents paid will be a waste because you didnt learn anything cause you goof of and you wont be able to have a successful job so visiting this job will change students thought pf whether they should play around or not so if you take your education serious you can have a job that pays you a lot of money and be successful in life but not doing anything in school wont get you anywhere.

So the city council should take step forward in to adopting the curfew law, because that would keep the teenagers out of trouble. Many teenagers follow the law, but those who do not will be breaking the law. This curfew law is going to help many ways, some teenagers stay out late socializing with they are friend; many times they are late to school the next morning. The benefits of this law would be that, it keeps the teenagers safe and out of trouble. If the curfew is adopted, it is going to keep the teenagers out of streets late at night. Me and my friend sometime go to 7-eleven late at night during weekdays around 10;30 p. m. If the law was in order right now, we would be breaking the law. On the weekend some teenagers might want to stay out longer with they are friends: socializing, making new friends, and building a good friendship. But a law is a law, If you are still out on the streets after 12 a. m then you would be breaking the law and going to be in trouble. This curfew law will set a boundary for teenagers who always come home late at night. This law might cut down little bit of they are freedom, but it is for they are own good. My mom always tells me to be home by 9:00 p. m on the weekdays, but I am always an hour late. When the curfew law is in order, my mom knows that i will be home by 10 p. m, because i do not like to break the law. It is better to be safe and out of trouble than getting in trouble and breaking the law. Many people would disagree with the curfew law because some teenagers work and do not have transportation; they have to walk from work to home after those hours. There-for it is parents job to make sure they are kids make it home safe. As parents you never want to see your child in danger or in trouble on the streets.

77,1641,6E3D46F9AAE1,"It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know. I think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Life gets irritating. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. We are always looking for something new. We never reach complete satisfaction. It is part of our nature, curiosity. Even the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth. Limiting what you do, causes you to shrink. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). Limitation in most cases is not a good thing. Sure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like. Doing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. We should always be going after growth.",9,9,9,8,9,9,1438,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

80,1644,5CAA840DD4C6,"AFTER SCHOOL HOMEWORK CLUB Generic_Name INTRODUCTION: Havent you ever thought of starting an after school homework club for students who are having difficulty in certain subjects?. BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school its call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or dont understand. 3rd of all you get to meet your teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again. FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those students could be are next president or are next doctor, police. this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot. MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesnt want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well thats what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because its really helpful for the students. outside in the worlds there some kids who dont even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes its good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured.",5,4,6,6,4,4,1198,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
81,1645,9A5193D1C19B,"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life. Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard, and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person. Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world. Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge. Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them.

I think that learning about the future is something I would have never thought I would do in times to come but here we are, they talk about it all the time but never do it so I would like to change that reality. Therefore that is one thing I will like to accomplish in the future. Have you ever heard Never knock it till you try it, thats what i will be talking about. There are a lot of thing I have never done in my life, one of them is playing music, I always listen to music like rap or pop. I have always wanted to do the guitar but i was too scared to do it. Now I take lessons for it, im trying to play it in other places. I have also wanted to rap I have it in me I just have to try and get my vocabulary up so I can say more in my music. I will start to take trying new thing serious. Fact checkers say that people who always play sports will live longer. What I will try to accomplish is playing every sport. I already play soccer so I am try to play more variety of sports. I have stared to play basketball more, I think right now playing basketball is more fun than soccer. I have played baseball and its fun but it is not for me, but as I said this is what im going to try in the future.

Lot of students cant stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more. First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom. They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better. Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesnt have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we dont know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose. The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they wont be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students dont need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they dont need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

In my opinion its not good idea because people need help from teachers, some people like to come to school, and they like to distract at school. Some people like to do they work by they self, but others people need help from teachers. For example my sister always stay after school for help from teachers. She said that they help her with the things she do not know about her classes.

For example when she fail a test she stay after school with the teacher, they review about the test, and she learn more. The teachers find the way to help students after school.

89,1653,471BD41D6BA9,"Some people say that to converse resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. our school is deciding if they should do a four day school week, with nine hours consisting each day. Others rather to have a normal school week. I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade. Other people say schools should follow this model because, A nine hour school day means more time for each class and having more time in all classes its helpful for homework or late work, They can take advantage of having Friday off students can have a job only on Fridays.

90,1654,0BF56A2681D3,"Dear, Principal I think students should do community service because we have to keep our schools clean. We should also have community service because it will help people be cleaner by picking up after them. The community service is very important because if know one picks up the trash thats in school then our school is going to look ugly. I think you should get people to pick up every day and then for the next day get another ten people and be rotating every day. Its also necessary to help out the community because we dont want to have a dirty environment for our children and younger kids. Thats why I think we should have community service most people think its not important but years later it will be important because our children are going to be the ones living with a bad environment . I think we should have community service for these reasons because if we dont clean up right now no one will clean up in the future and that will hurt us because we are going to be living in a bad environment because no one wanted to clean up . In the future we are not going to be able to smell oxygen because of the bad environment. These are all the reasons I had to say about why we should have community service.

92,1656,2BAF09F7004D,"As we know the modernization through the years is bringing us new advances in technology. One of the most important and positive effects of use of technology is make life more easy for everyone. I mean, the use of social media is given us a lot of way to communications no matter where we are; the facilities of communication and information on time are essential to accomplish many task. The complexity to communicate and create different way to interact had making a great way to a efficient communication. First of all, the use of technology is currently having big impacts in our lives. It is changing through the years the way how the humanity is living. There out are a lot of brilliant brain creating new advances in technology everyday. The expansion of the new advances day by day is given us a renovation of our life style. The interactions between everyone through communication using different devices such a computer, phone, iPad, etc.. The principles of those project of advances created and expended by people expert in technology; theve been implement the necessity of technology in every single places. It can also influenced our mental and physical health; depression and anxiety are common nowadays so there are website to providing helps online. The variety how we can combine knowledge in technology are infinities. That is one of the main reasons. Secondly, we are breaking all the limitations that we had before. If you are trying to communicate and if you were in large distance was limited because we did not have those resources such a Mobile devices. So now, we are currently, sending messages or texts, even we can do video calls on live simultaneous. This factor was not possible without the technology. Everyone is connected around the world. Those limitations are breaking because all the different social media: Facebook: One of the most famous and popular website to post, share videos, photos, websites, links. Twitter: This app is used mostly to post personal thought or opinions. Instagram: To post and now with new implement of sources for marketing. Gmail: It is one of the most popular account to mail. It is like Email but it is more modern. Email: is mostly used to messages. Blogs: is used to shared a personal version. It can be about life style, hobbies. Anything you want. YouTube: This is a platform with the purpose of given us videos some of them can promoting companies. In addiction, one of the important advantage is the facilities to do everything we want, when we want, where we want. The use of technology in school, colleges even work implement the easy way to accomplish everything. Now days, school bring to their students computers with the the purpose of advances in every single student to do their homework/assignments in home with all the necessary facilities. They want to give students information through books that you can easily get online. In the pass, it was impossible because you had to go to the library and get the permission to read a few books. So, now with the technology we can also use the technology with the purpose to sell or buy things online. Amazon is a good example of success marketing in the world. People buy things on Amazon because they do not have enough time to go to the store and buy their stuff. The platform of amazon is giving us enough details about those items that we want to buy. The majority of shop stores or companies have websites. This is creating a red of new jobs. Some people can work even in home using any device because technology is making that possible. Sometimes, the use of technology can be optional but something is a necessity. We have to adapt to the new modernization. That is because technology. Although even, there are some statements about some negative effects of technology such a limitation of communication, I can prove with real facts how the technology facility the interactions of contact to other people for example: group chat, messages, Facetime, live videos. Students can be connected with their classmate or vice verse even with their teachers. They just have to be connected. Social media is creating a direct and indirect connection to others, I mean the students can have conversations about projects or assignments through their phones or any device. The use of technology can be fun. We can use technology in video games and some of them have communication though microphone and we can really interact with our partner. We also can extend the communication and interact not just once or two as many as we want. Technology is given is entertainment. Sometimes we just want to be in our conform zone and that is okay. So its up to us if we want to work, play with somebody else or by ourselves. Its true that we can decide if we want to work, have fun by ourselves but the technology bring us the opportunity to interact with others. Finally, the use of technology is part of our lives already. We can deny the use of it in our daily activities. A simple example: If we are going to get a job, mostly of the applications are online. Every job is associate with technology. The use of them created good benefit in everyone. The effects of technology depends with the purpose we are using it. If our purpose is to using the technology to good benefit, the used of them will be successful either the purpose is about good or bad things. ""Every action, have a reaction"" Isaac Newton. The results of our good action will always have a positive effect. I can concluded, all those positive effects are making our work more easier. The use of technology in our society is impulsing us to be betters every day. All the results of hard works by every of us. The innovation of those advances are creating new mechanisms in our routine, new life style and all that is because we are smart enough to created technology, everything started from us. The majority of people is using technology with good purposes. The world is doing better because technology.",8,7,6,7,6,7,576,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them.

96,1660,0ABD502C5BF9,"have you ever needed examples to learn something or you learn better with different ways instead of receiving examples? Well, was as Albert Schweitzer said "" Example is not the main thing to influence others"". this means that there are other ways to influence other without using or giving examples. One way that people may get influenced is if they receive help from others, not receiving examples; This can be better than give examples to illustrate this, in the class of ceramic the teacher mostly give us examples of how to make clay stuff, she almost never help me and this results difficult for me and for others how to make things because she only explain one time how to do it and some of the students forget about it. when she help someone their project result always to be the best of the class because of her help on the student. Other people say that when they receive examples sometimes they get confused, this happens when the examples they get make them change their perspective over what they are doing, for example: doing a drawing, sometime the teacher tells to make a drawing of your imagination,this means of your thinking and whatever is on your brain. What could happen when the teacher tell you what to draw after she said that the drawing is about your imagination and she give examples on what to draw this make you think that she wants you to draw others things that are not on your thinking, this shows that sometimes the examples does not work on specific subjects because those get to confuse you. Although others may say that when they use examples they are more able to influence other because they show the experience that they have on it and also teach how to do something also there are many people that learn better get more influenced when they use examples. I think that there are a few ways that are stronger that make the examples less useful or powerless to influence others.

Another thing that the older kid can learn is to talk to people without being scared or shy this can also help them by getting a job when they grow up.

98,1662,F54386A8122B,"Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me. I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in todays society everything is depended on technology. What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that im trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school. With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldnt just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now. So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they wont stress there last year of high school, and they wont have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.

99,1663,E1AE7FDD072F,"Should students participate in extracurricular activities? There are many diffrenet activities for students, not only sports, but clubs and many more. There is other to life then school and activities. Students should have the ability to choose what they want to do in the extra time they have. Schools already take half of the students time with going to school and homework .I disagree that students must have an extracurricular activity because they could learn a new language, do better in school, and spend time with family and friends. First, students can learn another language besides their own. First, the language that they pick helps them with their applecation to colloge and in the real word. For example, it is more likely for a student that have two or three languages to be accepted in a colloge, unlike the student that only knows one. Second, students could communicate with others around the world. For example, if they learned Spanish, they can talk to others in Spain or around other that speak the same language. Third, they could be the only one that learned that language in your class or school. In conclusion, these were the advantges of learning a new language. Second, teenagers that are struggling in school could take their time and have an advantage to be better in school. First, they could study for their coming exams and be able to focus on them. For example, students could make study groups or study buddies for studying better. Second, after school students can get extra help from their teachers. For example, they would only focus on the students weak part on the subject. Third, they could make up for the extra work they missed from their classes. For example, a student is sick or had a docters appointment they could make up that work at home after school. In conclusion, students would do better in school with the extra time they have. Third, we need to spend time with family and friends. First, help your family with work around the house. For example, help your mom cook for dinner,or help your dad fix his computer,or help your siblings with homework. Second, you could hang out with your old friends. For example, go to mall,watch a movie ,or go to their house. Third, get to know eachother better. For example, play Never Have I Ever, Truth or Dare,and many more fun games you could play. In conclusion, spending more time with family and friends could grow you a stronger relashionship. In conclusion, I disagree that students have to have an activity because students can learn a language, have better outcomes on their report cards, and have quality time with friends and family. These were some reasons to not have an extracurricular activity. The principal should not force any student that do not want to do an activity make them.

101,1665,3CED6DDF77BE,"School districts should not offer programes that allow high school students to gradutade in three years instead of the traditional four years because elective courses are important as well as academic courses, the summer courses are expensive and parents should let the children to enjoy the summer. Elective courses are important besides the academic courses. A student should collect the other knowledges also. Only academic courses are not gonna help him/her to be a good human being. Afterall, he/she has some hobbies in his/her life like cooking, painting, designes, dancing, singing. Think, a student is only studying because he/she wants to graduate earlier than the traditional four years. What will happen next? At the point he/she will be tired of life which is absolutely unfair. Maybe she/he has a very good artist. How can he/she expose? The answer is through electives. No matter what a person works with, if he/she doesnt like to do that work, it never last longer. So, elective is a way to make student happy and cheerful. When the academics make them tired, electives help them to get out from there. Summer courses are expensive in some of the schools. Sometimes middle class family cant afford the courses fees. For this, the rich kids take the courses only. The poor kids stay behind. The poor kids cant afford the courses just because of money. Maybe they are more talented than the rich kids. They also should get that opportunity. Isnt it unfair for the poor students? Yes, it is. So, they shoudnt continue with this three years method. We should treat all the students equally. Students should enjoy the whole summer by doing outside activities. Students usually have school 9am to 5pm. They spend their whole time in the school. How can they make themselves involve with outside world? Normally they cant in the regular school days. For this, governments make this rule to free the studnets in the summer so that they can enjoy outside activities. If they think about the summer courses, its not possible to enjoy their summer honestly. A student leads a robotic life in usual school days. For mental health a person needs some free time or vacation. Its absolutely not possible for a person to lead a regular life everyday. Entertainment is important. A routined life, 9am to 5pm then returns to home, again homework. Life can not run like this. I understand that every parents want their child to be smarter than others. But it doesnt mean that they just have only one way to prove themselves by taking the summer course and entering college earlier. They can be a good artist or journalist. The parents should think about the children also. Not only about their academic abilty. There is a record in the United States that students attemp suicide because of study pressure. Isnt it shame for a country? A student is attempting suicide. why? because he/she cant handle the pressure. Without life, what will you do with the education? Mental peace is important. So, for mental health a student has to enjoy the summer. We have only one life to enjoy. Lets not waste it by thinking about academic career only. We have much things to do as well as academic. Just need to keep patience and walk with the flow. Life is beautiful. ",9,7,9,9,7,8,786,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

If the students will can study in classes online they can have a big opportunities and they can follow his dreams and has the all they want to do or they want to has. One reason its classes in online is benefit and better, students can learning more and they can have in the house because they can do a time for make all things they needed make, for example I want to graduate and I want to follow study but its difficult for me because I dont have time for anything I cant not make my homework, and study for my quizz. I need to work for buy my things, pay my house and my car. Its for these reason that I frefer class online, with these class I can have a lot time for me, and I can make my things and I can do the two things study and work. The second reason is the students can do a better work, and they can have a better grade. They can turn in a good homework or proyect with more information explained. For example when the students have more time, they can make a better work, because they are enfocus in his obligation like homework and proyects, and they want to be a good student is for that they can do effort for turn in a good proyects with the use the internet. They can do a good investing for make a homework they can find a lot information, if the students are a relax and they have a time they only need to study a few hours no is like in the school. In the school is more tired because they need to wake more early and they need to do a lot homework in the many classes. But if they study classes in online its more easy not its very hard like in the school. Some people say that the classes online its a lost time the student do not make nothing in his house, when they have classes online they lost time.

However, the classes in online is wonderfure because is a way to spend with the family because they can make a day fun with them and make differents things like play football, wath a movie, they can go to the cinemark and other places that they prefers.

From this we learn that two heads are better than one, that there are thing that arent meant to be done by youre self. We have come far from those days, we build structures withe intricate designs, we build ways to cross oceans in no time at all. I still wonder if a single individual would been able to do it . That is why team work is important. When you are acing to a team it is because you poses a ability or skill that benefits you. As a example you work on a company that creates websites for government projects, you poses a degree on couding and in graphic design. You have been employ as a content creator, you can see it this way you are a cog Pict meticulously to fit in a larger machine. One that runs at a constant pace, it dose not deviate or exert pressure on to the parts that compose it. Second when you work in a team the work loud is divide in to the right proportion. In a construction crew you will always find that the cement worker will away divide the cement in to portions, this is to prevent over use of cement. In a team you will receive the amount you can handel to prevent that someone is overwork. Like when you go to a kitchen you will see that one is piling the carrots,a other one is preparing the cake mix, a other the toppings. Everyone has a task to complete In conclusion we can see that team work has billions of benefits for every one. like a well oil machine you team work is all about communication. The result is one group working as one. Thers no error eache knows that the other is working on his part, like a in a kitchin one peals, theother mixes, and the last one refines there work.

105,1669,5828FAC247DF,"Should student commit their career at a young age ? In this statement i will argue if student should commit to chopse their career at a young age. In my opinion, i think student should think about their career at a young age. First reason why they should think about their career is because they could know some step of how to get into their career. They woukd know some steps on what to study or in other words know what classes are the right one to take. An example is that when i was in high school i didnt know what to study for. my teachers couldnt find the right classes for me to take. Most student get into high school without knowing what they would want to study for. Another example was that when i got into high school they ask me for my career i told them what i wanted to be. Once i got into 10 grade i change my mind and decided to change my career. When i try to get into my step for my second career it was already too late to apply which made me now find my own way to get into the career i wanted to be in. Most student get into high school with out knowing what they want to study for. Another reason is that when they dont know what to study for as their career, They dont find a way after in how to get into collage. It is always a good first step as a high schoolar to know what they want to be. Last exapmple is that i didnt think about my career when i was in middle school and now in my high school year i didnt get into any of my career i wanted to study for. When you know what you want your career to be teachers help you get the right classes. Teachers also help you get into the collage you want to study for your career. Some people think knowing what they want to study for before going to high school is just a rush thing for them. People be saying its too early to know or think about your career. In my conclusion, Most student should know at their young age what they wanna be. My advice to all the young student making their way to high school they should start thinking what they want to be. When they get into high school they will know what to do, how to apply and they would know what classes are just right for them to take for their career.",7,5,6,7,6,5,1137,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

109,1673,5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldnt be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend. To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information. Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school. Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend. Students would also adapt to find information in books. In conclusion, if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school, would be helpful to conserve energy and resources.",7,8,7,7,7,8,1197,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

EX: you sent them to go pick up trash and they go and they are just playing around they are going to be fighting with the trash throwing it where it was clean then later when they finish playing they are going to see a mess that they are going to get lazy and just walk away and go to another place where its cleaner and if they are trouble makers they are going to do that over and over again. Think about it if you let students that really want to help out and they do the same thing (throw the trash to each other) and if they really want to help out they are going to clean for them selves. and they are going to be helping because they want to ,not because you forced them to do community service.

We should formed our character by influences beyond our control. In addition, by the influences that we receive day by day we chooses how to be creating our character. For example, I introduced my character in the situations the I pass, that help me how to be a better person. Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she cant believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we dont want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we dont want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i dont try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future. Also, Things are necessary somethings is hart to change our character because we think the we are okay but other think all the appositive, so we never have to think the we are fine because the never is going to happened always we have to be better in some thing we need to be honest with our lives and accept what we are doing wrong is more better to accept our errors and there is went we are going to see how our character change in a better way and then we are going to feel happy about our character and our lives. Moreover, The influences control our character by the way the we act and think. For example, I was a person the if something I dont like I really have to talk to you the was horrible. Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really dont like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we dont think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we dont think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you dont like the people act with a bad attitude you dont have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the. In addition, all thinks the people said about you help you with your character, dont feel sad because you change your way to think. Obviously the take your time because you are not going to change in one morning but with a professional character more doors are going to open and more opportunities came so take other people influences. Some people argument the we should choose our own character traits, because some people just are going to tell you bad opinions in the way the you have to act. Moreover, some people believe the is no necessary to get a great character. In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we dont have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that. In addition, some people dont care if you are okay, or how you feel. In addition others argument the is necessary listen to others influences because sometimes we dont find a way to resolve our character problems bur other know what to do and they try to find a way to make you live easy. For example, I know some people the dont know how to control they character when they are mad soy they contact person the know how to act in the situations. Also, some people take careers for find solution to person the have serious problems with they character I really dont know if is normal the people get mad went they want to eat, I have a friend with the problem in my point of view the is not normal because i never pass from the situation so I cant help her but people the have long time studying on the yes they can tell her what way to eat or i dont know but they have a solution for the problem in her character. In Addition all this problems can help you to have a good character a better attitude because is necessary for talk with other because we need to have a way a formed how to talk without breaking they feelings because as humans the we are we feel sad went other trade us with a mad face and sometimes we performed dont talk to then. So always remember the a good attitude change to many things. In Conclusion, sometimes is necessary be influencing by other because they give you different ways how to be working in your character. In addition they received influences by other help you with the control in your character by changing a your way to act and covert you in a better person. Also help your character in a better way to think, in be focus on your ideas. In conclusion all this things are necessary in whatever way the you want to used then because in the proved of the live all things are necessary event if are smalls things they are necessary dont thing the people just influences your self in change your character because they just want to fight with not the is not like that is people is trying to give you a better influences about how you have to act because they always want better things to you. Always if you do bad on your character they are going to tell you and I thing the is more better if they tell you what you are doing wrong the others persons the you dont know came just for the just because you dont want to obey always think in you future.

Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals. If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family. Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation. Having this much pressure can affect studentss grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do.

117,1681,830E5FA9FC72,"The Negative Effects Of The Technology On Peoples Lives. Technology helps people to preform many things hence, classes online, shop and communicate with others. I believed that technology has negative effects on peoples lives because people have a limitation of a human contact due to the use of technology. Also technology had changed our style of lives; People used to visit parks to talk with other. Families do not spend time together. Students are distracted with their cell phone at schools. Children do not read books or have fun like in the past. Now everything had changed due to this issue. One reason that technology has negative effects on peoples lives is that now some stores closed because people do not shop in this stores anymore. Some people prefer to buy their materials or clothes online stores as Amazon. Amazon has a strong impact of sales in the world, Their sales are more high than any other stores. For example I recently heard about two store named STORE_NAME and STORE_NAME. They have this issue due to the use of technology. STORE_NAME is about to close because people prefer to stay at home and buy online. This stores are on sale of everything to close right away because Fewer people visit this stores. Their sales had exceed on online store than in the located stores. Additionally people who work in this stores are going to have a layoff due to this matter. Another reason that technology has negative effects on peoples lives is that some places are empty namely: Parks, lakes, and malls. People decide to stay at home playing video games, and buying online. Some people think that technology is a better way to express themselves. However, there are to many ways such as painting, drawing, playing even dancing. Example I am a member of a dance class, my teacher was talking about this problem with technology. She was saying that sometimes our lives depend on a cell device, but not all the time. My point of view is that what she told me was true because I came to United Stated of America since 2016; I was not be able to understand or speak to others. When I did not understand some difficult words I used Google translated, so technology helped us sometime. However, I had seen some students who used their cellphone during classes. When the teacher ask them questions related to the topic, they do not know what to answer due to the technology. In the other hand Some people will argue about technology has positive effects on our style of lives. Technology helps us to communicate with our families and friends. However technology limited us to express our ideas with no need of a cell phone device . Also it had destroyed our culture. It limited the growth of children because, they do not want to go outside to play with their friends. Children want to stay at home playing with their laptops. In fact this generation do not read books or magazine because of the technology. Example, My cousin is in the middle school he played Fourtnite everyday. He goes to sleep late, had bad grades and he wake up late for school. He does not read any book and neither go outside to play. He always is with his cell phone playing. I believe that the life is so short to waste. In the final analyses technology will keep going to destroy our cultures. People will not go outside at all, to buy, to have fun, or to spend time with their families. My point of view is technology have a really negative effect on us because it had changed us, our world. everything in this world is going to be different. Technology limited the develop of ideas.Technology limited our communication, our knowledge, our curiosity, and our happiness.

Life can be hard if people dont enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years. Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if its a good idea. Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. Its like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you dont know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for. Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if its the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what were interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future. In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",7,8,8,8,6,7,1289,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do. Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So its good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them. Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school. In conclusion, I think its good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program. This can help older and younger students to work together. And helping one in other is to help improve what they need help on. Like on homework,classwork,and projects to see what the need to improve.",6,5,6,5,6,6,2723,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
120,1684,E1E09D32484D,"Do we choose our character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? Some believe people choose their own character traits and who they want to be. Others believe that our character is formed by influence. I think we choose how to make our own character traits and we choose the attitude we want to give to others. This is important because our character is what represent us and is what makes us responsible for the person we chose to be. First, people have the power of choosing who they want to be and producing their own attitude. For example, characteristic is important because is the quality, or property of us and it is what makes us committed to keep moving on the person we chose to be and different from others. Furthermore, I believe that people should choose their own character traits even though if they think that is formed by influences beyond their control. Perhaps some people should do the effort to change it because not everyone have a good and nice character. Additionally, a persons personality is the collection of emotional and behavioral traits that characterize them. Personality and attitude is the key to be a role model for others to become a great person and care more about whether we choose wisely our character were giving to other peoples. Peoples humility and kindness is priceless. Personality and attitude is what represents us and what makes us noble. For example, people can think that our own character traits is formed by influences but they still change it and do the effort to be a better person everyday. However, not everyone agrees with this position. Some people claim that our character is formed by influences beyond our control. If we do not choose our character traits and they are formed by influences beyond our control, it might have its disadvantages. For example, one must consider that there are people who have a bad character and end up alone because of their attitude, also their character can brings other people displeasure and make them go away and not get close to you just because they think you will never change your character but our character will be what we, ourselves choose to make it. In conclusion, I think choosing our character, personality, and attitude is what makes us a humble and noble person to look up. I also think that some people should focus on the attitude they are giving to others and analyze if its what they would like to receive from someone else and if it brings them displeasure, perhaps it encourages them to change a bad character for a good personality and attitude.

Technology has negative effect on our life here is why .In school the teacher goes over present ion online and it does not teach the student how to do there assignment . Because of the technology there is no teacher and student connection. In my country when i was young we did not had any technology my teacher would go over the assignment and he would explain the assignment on the board and if you did not get it .He would explained it to you again thats what school should be about making a connection with the teachers. I remember when i was young me and my friends would hangout in the cafeteria we would talk about our day. But now because of the technology during lunch time all my friend just uses there phone and we dont even talk to each other. Because Limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on on peoples life. Because of the technology we have war between country with nuclear weapon. Because of technology people do not go outside of there house. They stay home and watches movies,read book and play games cause they have the technology to do that. they dont care what happen outside even if some is dying outsides of there house the would not care because of technology makes human emotion less and makes us weaker. We depend on technology way to much. when i was young if need a book i would go to the library and get the book rather than being lazy and sit on the couch and order it online technology makes us lazy. I remember we would go to eat food out and enjoy each other company talk to each other. Nowadays people just order food online and eat inside and use there phone rather than talking to each other.

To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery. If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learnand teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you cant do one small task doesnt mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow.

First impressions are almost always: wrong, judgmental, or they are assumptions. Id like to say that I, Generic_Name, have had first impression on classmates, teachers, and strangers. They usually end up being wrong about that person, and end up being a totally different person than expected. First impressions are 80 percent always judgmental. They judge the person by what they wear, by what they look like, and by the way they act. I for example was non for being a trouble maker in middle school and when I started my freshman year of high school, I was non as a quiet kid for a while. Reason being is because i was too nerves sent it was my first year in a much bigger school. After a while, my classmates started to get to know me a bit more and realized how much of a troublemaker I was. Whenever I saw a new need student in the schools that i have gone to, I would always assume by the way they dressed, looked and acted. This year there was a girl, lets call her Generic_Name.

126,1690,331103D7D5CF,"""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing, "" said by the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Giving a good example by your own experience might influence other people; it depends on the situation. In my opinion, giving a good example is not the only thing to influence people as said in the quote, but there are things other than setting a good examples that influence people. For example, if someone had experience in playing basketball, and another guy was a beginner, it will be helpful if the experienced one helps him and shows him how to play by training him, but if the experienced one tells the begginner person an example of how to shoot the ball but not by showing him, it wouldnt be helpful to him and wont influence him. One of the reasons i think that example might not be helpful is because when time moves on, the way that things work changes. Some people when they set a good example to influence someone that need motivation, they set an example from their own experience that might be some years ago, That can create a problem. For example, if a computer science major who graduated 10 years ago, and another one who just started college to study computer science and have some obstacles, if the major gave examples to the other guy about what he did in college 10 years ago to influence him, it would be a problem because as time goes we humans move forward in technology and we develop the education, so if the major gave the other guy his own experience it would be different than college now. This example wont help the guy who just started college, but it would be better if the major showed him the way to study and try to explain to him things. Sometimes people understand examples wrongly and influence others in an incorrect way, and it can be a big problem, It can turn motivation into failure. For example, there was a famous quote saying that failing many times without loss of enthusiasm leads to success, if someone study medicine in college and then he found himself failing tests and projects, but he took this quote as his influencer and he didnt lose enthusiasm, maybe after a while when he find himself still getting the same grades, he will lose enthusiasm and he will give up. The problem here is that he misunderstood the quote, the quote meant that he shouldnt loss enthusiasm even if he fail many times, but he thought that after failing two or three times he will do more better. Some people may argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only and best way to influence other people, because they think that if people follow the examples of the experienced people, they will succeed and will be motivated to do more work. For example, if someone successful gave an example of how he became successful, and what obstacles did stop him, and how did he get through them, Maybe some teenager listen to him and become influenced, and then he work hard to become like the successful guy. Or maybe someone who failed in something listen to the successful guy and learn how did he get through the things that stopped him, and then he become motivated to be successful and he work hard to reach his goal. In conclusion, influencing others by your own experience might be helpful to some people, but also it can become a problem and not helpful to alot of people. Furthermor, using examples from your own behavior is not the only way to influence others, thats why i disagree with the quote, because examples could be perfect, but it is not the best or the only way. There are other ways as i mentioned, that could turn peoples lifes from failure to success.",7,6,7,7,6,7,659,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
127,1691,F30AD5A2B74A,"Do you agree with ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm, yes or not? I agree with Churchills statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiams because not all the time we can win or make the things perfect. For example, when I took my English test last year in my English class. I practiced a lot and I did my best for taking A+ or maybe B+, but I did pass the test. I was very sad, however, my teacher told me that I had a second chance. So, I took it and this time I passed with A-, I was so excited. To fall out the test made me to understand that it doesnt matter how many times we can fall out about what we want, we only need to be strong and try as much as we can for being successful. Moreover, this year my aunt was trying to travel to El salvador, but when she called to the airline for buying the ticket, the tickets were so spends and she doesnt have to much money, so she decided to wait few months. seven month ago she called again to the airline and the prices tickests increase more money, but she didnt want to continue waiting more time so she decided to buy it, when she was buying the tickets the person told to her of her ID was already expire, so she can not buy the ticket. My aunt was sad because she did not remember about to renew her documents, but she went to renew her documents some weeks later and after that she has to wait at less three months to receive the new ID. at this time the three months already pass and she didnt receive her ID, shes really sad because she wants to go visit my grandmother. even thoug she cant travel yet, she doesnt lose her enthusiasm of travel this year to my country. Churchills statement of success consists of going to failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm is more than true because anybody is perfect and we need to fall out for learn lessons and learn to be stronger persons in the life. some people think this statement is not true because some of them loss multiple times for being successful in their life. also, they say when the person loss the first two times theyre losers, stupy persons, or other bad things that are not right. in my oponion this cause happend to them or they are saing that because they loss their enthusiams and become weak person. in conclusion, for being successful we have to fall out in the life, like when i fall out my test and with my aunt cause. this teach to everyone to be stronger person and never lose their enthusiams of be successful in each persons life.

128,1692,EDD899D4131D,"Generic_Name thinks the school should control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Students are in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. Some people think schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because they would know if the students grades are good enough to enroll in a activity or more. Other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in a extracurricular activities because the school cant force you do a sport you dont want to do and they cant push away your dreams of playing a sport. Generic_Name thinks schools need to control students involvements in the extracurricular activities because not a lot of parents care if they children have time for extra assignments or they dont care if their kids stay out late to participate in any activity related to school. First of all, people think schools should decide students involvement in activities. Some students want to play many sports but not all of them will have time to complete homework assignments or study fr any quizzes and tests. For example Generic_Names older sister use to play two sports. One was related to school and the other one was outside of school. She never had time to do her homework so her grade was going down. She also had to study for her tests but she didnt have time since she was practicing her sport too much and so she failed the grade. Secondly, other people think students and families have the decision to pick whether students should be involved in activities. An example is Generic_Names friend wouldnt want the school to not let him play the sport he always been wanting to play. Generic_Names friend thinks it wouldnt be fair to force him to play a sport he doesnt like. Generic_Name, Generic_Names friend would like to play a sport to distract his mind if he is stressing or is having depression. Generic_Name also wants to have the choice to pick any sport he would like to play but also wants to finish his work in class or study his tests during lunch or before school so he doesnt fail. Lastly, the majority of people think schools need to control students involvement in activities because not a lot of parents care if their children have time for assignments or to study for tests. In general parents dont care about their kids schools or grades so they wont worry if their kids are out late for any sport. One example, Generic_Names aunt dont care about his cousin Generic_Name so she is always out late. Generic_Name wants to try a sport in school so she can get a scholarship to go to college since her parents dont care about her but she wants to be someone in life and do better things. She wants to decide on her own if she should join a sport or not. I think the school should control the students involvement in sports. The school should control the students involvements in sports because theyre can be students that want to get a scholarship by playing a sport but also want to have time to finish classwork they couldnt finish in class or study their test to not fail the class. I also think school should control the students involvement in activities to take their mind of things that are distracting them or stressing them.

I disagree with expending the school day, I think its not good for us. First ,every student have something they like to do, so students can join a club or an activity after school. If the school board adds one and a half hours to school each day, students will attend their activities late. The activity lasts about 2 hours or later, students may get home after the sun sets up. In the winter ,the sun sets up so early, the day is short, its too dangerous for the students who walk home. Second, we have about seven hours in the school every day, I think we need more time to study at home. Its quiet when we study at home. Students can use these time fully. We can learn new knowledge, do sports, review everything we learn, and so on. However, there are some new students from different countries, they can not speak English very well,they need more time to study. So, I think its not good to expend the school day.

We have a lot of homework in the high school, we may finish homework late. Its not good for students. The students in the high school must sleep for about eight hours every day.

130,1694,F9BE4676CA35,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity. To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or wont even have breathing problems or mostly any issues. How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot . Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isnt just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun . collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they arent just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you cant take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others . Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesnt hurt you to give it a try .

The students can come one hour early, before school start, and they can take class every day of school, or they can stay one hour after school to take the class. However, some students think that is tired to come early to the school, or stay after school. Instead elective courses, the students can take classes, that they need for graduate. The students can use the time, that they uses for the elective courses, they can use it for the classes they need for graduate. The elective courses it does not prepare to the students for college, and the regular classes prepare them for college. If the students finish high school in three years, they will go early to the college. The students will have more time to study in college. The students will have time to think, what they want to study in college. Also, the students can finish very early their career. However, some students think, they need four years in high school for to be very prepare for college. The students will have time to think, which college they want to go. I believe that is better finish college in three yeras, because the students get more time to go to college, so, when they finish their career. Then, they can study another career, because they will still young. If, the students stay four years in high school, they will not have enough time to study two careers. If, them finish two career, they will have a lot of opportunities to get a good job, and have a good pay.",8,6,6,6,5,6,1427,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
135,1699,38203808F81B,"Should students be expected to commit to a career at a young age? Some societies say yes, by the time they get to high school they will be given courses to guide them toward the career they have chosen. With the students given the classes needed by the guidance teacher, It will get them a well paying job right after graduating because they will already have the classes needed for that job. If they plan on going to collage to become a scientist they will offer you classes for free and you wont have to pay for those classes in collage. By having students identify a career by the time they enter high school seems to me like a great idea. once they know what there career is going to be they can take the classes required for that job. Once the student has identified the career that he or she desires, the guidance teacher will step in and set up the classes that youll need to take for the career that youve chosen. when I first entered high school the guidance teacher pulled everyone out of class to ask us what our career was going to be. I remember telling her that I wanted to become a carpenter, she said""great choice we actually have another school that you can go for the second half of school"". I told her that seems great, she also put me some math classes because in carpentry you use math to measure. That was how the guidance teacher helped me achieve the career that I wanted by helping me get the classes that I needed to become a carpenter. By committing to a career at a young age actually helps the students succeed in life. How does it help the student succeed? It helps the students get a good job by the time they are out of high school, by giving him the classes required for the career he wants. For example some of the students that didnt commit to a career when they where in high school are now working in a low paying job. Some are even in a lot of debt paying for the classes needed for the career they want while they could of got some classes for free in high school. One of my cousins went to high school and every year the guidance teacher would ask him what he wanted his career to be. He would always say I dont know yet, time went by and when he finally found what he wanted his career to be it was to late. My cousin is now in big debt with the bank trying to pay for his classes that he needs for his engineering job. If one of the students decides he wants to become a scientist when he grows up. The guidance teacher will give him the classes needed like Biology and science classes. Once he gets into collage he will already have some of the classes required to become a scientist. He will only have to pay for the classes that are not provided in school. My uncles daughter is studying to become a teacher, when my cousin was in ninth grade she told the guidance teacher that she wanted to become a teacher. She was given some of the classes that are required to become a teacher but they told her that she would have to go to collage but they would give her all the classes that they could offer so she wouldnt have to pay as much when she went to collage to become a teacher. Other people argue that a students should not commit to a career at a young age because they dont know about all the careers that are out in the world. They could chose one and latter change there minds into anther career. The is a good chance that all the students who chose the career they wanted ends up being the job that they have in the future. With having the students to commit to a career at a young age is good because they will be given the classes they need in order to be successful in the career that theyve chosen.

I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean. reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks Ive been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games. Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup. One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays. The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when were in a water park. Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city im gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos. Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when im in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family. The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium. I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too. One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually dont have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together. I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun.

137,1701,7680EF5AD3CB,"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because its pointless, unfair, and not important. To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. Its also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. Its no where near educational related. It wouldnt be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class. The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless. In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. its not important for students to take any of those classes. Its not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs dont require for you to have any of those classes. ",7,7,6,8,8,7,1543,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

139,1703,491FA41A1499,"What are some good attitudes you can show it to your friends. I saw people have good attitudes in their way like one of my friend. If people have good attitudes that doesnt mean they dont have attitudes. Having good attitudes mean they have attitudes in a good way. My friend showed attitudes to different people in a different way. You can tell when people have bad attitudes or good attitudes. The good attitudes helps you to success in your life even when you have difficult time. The benefits of have good attitudes is you can success in your life, be happy, and have friends. You can only success in your life by getting support from your family and your friends. Most of the people show their attitudes at school like one of my friend does. She never showed bad attitudes with her teacher or other adults but she does show attitudes with her friends but not bad way. She showed bad attitudes some time and good attitudes sometime. She think its fun because we are all same. She dont feel bad when she show us attitudes. She knows we are not going to feel bad for that. We all will help her out when she needed. Like I said you can success in your life by getting support from you friends. If she have fake friends she knows they never will help her when she needed. Be happy, I mean that by getting good grades at school. If you get good grades that mean everyone happy even your teacher. My friend, she always try to get our help before she ask her teacher. Is not that she is bad at school. Everyone get confused at something. I saw lots of difficult time at her life and we all tried to help. If she wasnt being kind to us no one would of friend with her. Also one time a teacher tried to help her to get good grades at class. She had C+ at class she needed only some point to get B- so that she can get A B honor roll. She request her teacher if she can help her out with it ,and her teacher gave extra point on test she took. Her teacher told her I only did that because you are a kind person. I will love to help someone like you. Its not easy to make friends. Some people like to have friends who is kind to them, have good attitudes, have some similarities between each other. Some people make friends who has bad attitudes like them. They think talking with a nice person is embarrassing. Some people like having a good friends who never will leave them behind. If you make a friend who have bad attitudes all the time that means she/he is your fake friends. Also, a kind person can be also a fake friend. For example, when I moved into a new school I had friend. She always helped me. She was really polite to me. She helped me to find my classes, she helped me make new friends because I was a shy person. After some days letter there was a another girl moved in there. After that girl moved int here she never talked me. I tried to go talk to her but she didnt really care. Sometime when I saw her in the hall I said ""hi"" and she also said it back. After while she never even look at me. Its like she dont even know who I am. So yeah, its hard to find friend who really care about you. In conclusions, some good attitudes you show it to your friends is be with them when they need you the most, be polite to them. Having good attitudes can help people future a lot. You have to explore that good attitudes. Some people dont even know what is good attitudes mean. They think attitudes is attitudes, they think having attitudes mean being really mean to people. But there is so many way to show attitudes, good way and bad way. Good attitudes helps people to success in their life. In additional, to success in life you also need your family and friends help.

140,1704,DBC60BDBC49E,The school board shouldnt add one and half hours to school each day. To begin one reason i think they shouldnt is that a lot of kids who play sports or clubs after school might not be able to because they dont have time to learn about how life is and how difficult it is and peoples life difficulties. One example is that some kids play videos and since they dont have lots of time out side of school they might just play video game instead of sports and if you give them more time out of school more opportunities students will have. secondly Students will be more tired and less focus because if students have more time in school the more earlier they will have to sleep and most students dont fall asleep early also students have homework since they well most likely be tired from school they might take a nap and there might either wake up to late to do homework or not have time to finish all there homework. Thirdly more students will not want to be in school and may drop out from either too much stress or they just dont want to be in school because the longer time there in school the more tired they are and less time they have to do what makes them feel relaxed or not have time to do what they love to do. students also might not have time to make friends because there focusing on school and it might ruin there social skill and conversation with strangers out side of school. Lastly less amount of time they have to spend with there families because they would have to go to school for extra time and as soon as they get home they have to do homework and honestly by the time there done there going to be most likely tired to do anything beside resting or sleeping. Also some students have younger siblings to take care of after school so that would put more stress on a student and either a family would have to pay for a baby sitter or some families dont have money to pay for one so parents might take there student out of school just to take care of there sibling and so the extra time in school wouldnt help him. To conclude those are the main reasons why I think we shouldnt have more school hours in school. ,7,6,6,6,8,7,3100,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
141,1705,953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need. To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step. Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and shes a junior. When we dont have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; shes not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior. Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, Ive heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when theyre in college. To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything.

People believe that technology these days is a big part of society and that its effecting people lives in a negative way. They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they cant get nothing done. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons. First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives. Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach. Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we cant reach. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy. In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life.

143,1707,CFBD5DD8ECFD,"Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks. The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didnt have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family. The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because its close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. In addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I dont get tired and get bad grades in school. In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. ",7,8,7,7,8,8,2862,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

145,1709,AB75D2DC92B7,"Schools were made for people who wants to learn and be a successful person in life even though , there are some people who dont have the opportunity to be in school. Right now in some countries be on school until you are 18 is a law but it other countries government those not care about children future. Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school s should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible, second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success. In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you dont fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and dont waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that dont know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you dont depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own. In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats. In conclusion I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

It was majorly graded on her performance, but next time she practiced her way to present her presentation five-six times and thought about how she can do this and she doesnt have to be scared of anything and she got 100 on it, which was her goal. Also. a sports team lose few time because the players not getting along or one is better than other, which they can change by thinking equally and being friendly to each other. It shows the optimistic behavior of human supports during their task. Your past always reflects on your future. Everyone learns something from their mistakes or good memories. For example if Generic_Name did good on her presentation because she the way she presented, it illustrates that she more confident and positive to do her same presentation without worrying.

Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you arent just keep trying and be possitive everytime. Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, Thats making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be. A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery. This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasnt there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wernt going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done. The whole time i was pissitive, I wasnt scare at all i didnt have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i coulnt wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost $1,100 per week and im just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but thats how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god im still here alive. Hope you guys like it and remeber always possitive attitude.

148,1712,4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home wont be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I dont think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they dont learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea wont work out. Mostly, in every home there is problem which we dont want to share with anyone or we dont want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might dont want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they dont want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school. Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they wont come to school, so they can have a day off. I mean if a student cant learn something from school how could he or she learn from home. However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them dont even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person dont care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning cant help it out. if you are out somewhere and youre teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying. However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they cant learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I dont think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I dont think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher cant handle every student differently, so I dont think that this idea would work.",8,7,7,6,6,7,1009,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
149,1713,EAB74EEE65B3,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Everyday after school my brother and I go to the library to do our homework, when we get there I dont have any contact with him nor him with me. Nowadays, when I go to the library I can see many people sitting there, staring at the screen of a computer without having contact with the other person that it is near them. Having access to technology has positive effects but it also have negative effects. The limitation use of technology has negative effects on peoples lives because it keeps us away from the ones that are near us, it can damage our way of living, and also it can make us to become addicted to it. While we are in touch with technology, we are keeping away our self from the ones that are near us. For example, I have this friend we have always eat lunch together none of us have a cellphone, but one day my friend came to school with a cellphone that her mom bought for her. We were eating lunch, I was talking to her, but she was not listening to me because she was more into her cellphone than me. Technology can allow us to have contact with the ones that are far away from us, but we need to manage our time we can talk to them when we are alone and not when we are near a person that we can talk to. Having any type of technology near us while we are with somebody else it is not a good idea. Therefore, one day I decided to let my friend being herself with her cellphone, and I stop eating lunch with her. Technology send me away from her even though maybe she did not want that to happened. From that day I learned that if I want to keep the person that it is always near me, I just need to give them more attention instead of giving all my attention to a cellphone. To continue, technology can damage our way of living, it can effect us in a way that we have not even think about it. For instance, when I turned seventeen years old my parents bought me a cellphone, from then I was too lazy to do my homework and refuse to talk to them because I have a cellphone and I can be in contact with the ones that are not near me. Access to technology made me lazy and careless about school. One day my parents decided to took my cellphone for a week I was really mad at them that I stop eating and then I got sick. Meanwhile, technology can help people with their tasks, but it can also make people careless about important things that can be useful for their future. Some say that the use of technology have a great positive effect in our life, but I disagree with it because the use of technology it just stop us from being active with others and become careless about things that we were interesting in. For example, I was really interested on taking dancing lessons, so I decided that I can just watch dancing videos in my computer and it will be the same, but actually I did not watch the dancing lesson videos, I ended up watching something else that it does not have anything to do with dancing lessons. While some people think that technology have positive effects, I dont think the same. With the use of technology everyday we become addicted to it. Therefore I think technology does not have positive effect on peoples life it might have some positives effects but there are more negative effects than positives. In conclusion, Technology allows people to complete many tasks and can help us to connect with others around the world but are we really giving some time to the ones that are near us? I dont think so. Lets be positive dont let technology take away the people near us. Lets think smart we can do better in our life without being sitting there for an hour or more staring to a computer, cellphone or another electronic device when we can be enjoying the people that it is always there for us, near to us, and giving their time to us.

150,1714,4D23A7FA9408,"Although some say students wouldnt benefit attending classes from home because students will not have the opportunity to work in groups with other students, actually students would benefit attending classes from home because they will feel comfortable and students can be more safe. Those who believed not being able to attend classes fom home wouldnt benefit students because they cant work with other students. Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes dont have the best projects just because they cant have other students opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a persons ideas. However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated. Also, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can be more safe. Lately, more than hundred school shootings had happened, so it show us being at school can be dangerous. Other big danger can be gangs at school they can be an influence with so many bad things on a childs life. In my opinion being able to attend classes at home can make parents happy; they dont have to be worried for their childs safety. As you can see students wouldnt benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students cant stay connect with other students, actually being able to attend classes from home would make students feel comfortable and secure.

I personally agree that is almost impossible to change an impression about someone so lets say that I agree and disagree because the statement is right but not everyone is the same, your thoughts and the way you think are different from everyone else, so the way you feel about a person could change over time. The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone youve never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, youre so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldnt want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it dont add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and youre not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guys eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free. It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and dont doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite. If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect dont expect something else because it will come back to you and theres this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I dont think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if youre a lair dont be mad or dont ask God why is he doing this to you because thats what you planted in the beginning. When you meet a person what are the first impressions you get of that person on how they look, act and talk. When I first came in Generic_Name class and actually met her, my first impression was shes very nice, knows how to properly talk to students and as time pass I got my points proved right.

152,1716,F747581D0782,"Many people believe that the infulences from others make us change on who we are, I believe that. Growing up we all had good and bad infulences at school, home, or in any other place. As a kid, every little thing you see or hear; you copy. Thats why you have to be careful what happens around kids, because it may affect them later on in life. For an example, when parents argue infront of there kids its tramatizing and they may learn from that. Once there all grown up they can either be better then there parents or exactly the same or even worse, all because they were influenced by there parents arguments. Its not only just the arguments but when parents are abusive towards each other or when parents hit there childern, even the use of drugs, it will affect the child later on. Kids believe that because someone else did it, its okay for them to be able to do it too; and thats not right. As a parent, it is very important to talk to your childern at a young age about the right way and the wrong way. Every parent wants the best for their child, they dont want to see them make misakes or anything. As a teenager we think its annoying or we think they dont understand the way were feeling, but thats not true. They give us advice and ground us when we do the wrong thing because they dont want us to go through any of that again. They were once teenagers too and they already went through what were going through. They just want the best for us, because half of the time they couldnt be succesful and they want you to be able to grow up and have the things they were not able to get you. Another example could be the different types of infulences at school. Theres always gonna be the good kids and the bad kids, you just gotta see which side is gonna lead you into a better future. The good influences will want the best for you, for you to continue school, to not do drugs, to not do anything ilegal, ect. On the other hand, the bad kids will want you to ditch school, do drugs, do ilegal things, because as to them its all ""fun"". It may seem fun but there are consequences when you do the wrong thing. As a teenager you already have to have an idea on what you wanna do later on in life. Half the teens dont know, because there stuck in a world where it invloves, parties, alcohol, drugs, sex, ect. When your stuck in a world like that, its very hard to get out. Being influenced by friends is very easy. Of all the times you guys hang out and everthing, it starts to change you; from being well influenced or bad influenced. perperssure is the reason alot of us take the wrong lane in life. Your friends can convince you of doing something then your going to want to keep doing it, even if you didnt like it, because you dont wanna seem as a boring person, you dont want your friends to leave you on the side. You can even be the reason why someone choosed the wrong lane. Even if you changed the way you are someone else is still suffering because they were influenced by you. Majority of the time people regert the things they did in the past. They regert being infulenced that way, wishing they could have listened to the good, but sadly you cant change the past. Thats why its important to know exacty what were doing, to listen to the people who are telling us to do the right thing. we might not wanna seem boring but once we have an actual future, you will see that all the bad infuence wasnt worth it. We are influenced by others, and we choice to become that person.

I hope that you are good , the reason why I am writing this letter is because I want to tell you or ask you or get the permission of you , if I can visit your business? Well I have some reason ,why I want to visit your business : First I wanna visit your business because I am interest and I wanna learn more of your business, because I want to work or have a career in my High School , probabily may you ask why I am so interesting of your business , but the answer is this is because one day I was at my hause playing soccer with my friends, and after we done to play, my mom call me that was a mergency at my sister hause, so I drived so fast that I can , when I was there , my sister had a heart attack , so we took her to the hospital , so after the thirty minute was nobody there who can attend us and the more time that we was spanding more bad was my sister , so I was so angry with the hospital service, so we didnt want to continue weating in the same hospital , so we went to another hospital that people said that is good hospital , but real was that there was the same thing , so my question was where are the doctors? why nobody attend us? my sister is almost die after 30 minutes a doctor came to us to attend my sister , now my sister is good she has no problems with her heart , but when the doctor done to attend us , I asked him a question , I said why all the hospitals take to long for attend the people? and he said Its becuase we dont have many medicament to attend all people who enter sick or with serious problems also he said we dont have a good suply for attend the people who came very sick or almost dieing, also we dont have many doctors in here, that why we are slow to attend the people. well I was thinking about all people who die because in many hospital dont attend them, but sometime the people dont see the problems that happenning in the hospitals ,also many doctors dont get a pay , but they still working because they see the needs the people have. well I thought that may be I can be a doctor who save life and help people who need it , that is why I am interest in this business or job. Second reason why I wanna convince you to let me visit your business its because I wanna be a doctor, and learn how talk to sick people , and see what things you use to emergency , also I want to have a good aventure , also I wanna meat people to make new friends , my second point is a little be friendly , because in your business you have to make friends to help or you can help them, like sometime we dont know something how do it , and may be your partner know how do it, that I am trying to explaim is that if make friends in job or business is to work problems that you dont know together, but if I make friends in the business its to work , not for play during the work.. Third reason I want to convince you is that many people or students wanna explore certian occupations , I select this one because I wanna learn about your business, how they work ? what type the rules is in your business, and how much you pay , what days we have free, all the normal things that we know that I have to learn , and also I want to know, how many days we work by week? . Fourth reason that I want to convince you maneger is that your business is the best one and I wanna learn everything of your business and know more everyday and , you know what? when I was little my mom asked me that what I wanna be when I have more age or what are my dreams , everyday my mom asked me the same questions and I said I wanna be doctor the person who save life who help people and my mom told that if I put all the me , also I tell you a short story , One day when I had five years old , I was in the school , and some bad people that they only like to play around and make people angry , one day I was studying and one of those kids started to annoying me and teld me bad words , but he told me one thing that I never I will forget is that he told me that never I will have my dreams in my life, that I will looking for but never will be real, and I started to think about it and I was like sad because I thought that if that he told is real, if I never find my dream, what will happen with me ? what will be my life? and one day I was thinking in room I said I never give up , I will fight for my dreams , and nobody teld me what to do , I just will follow my heart for everything , the point of this short story is that never give up if have a dream looking for ,dont let people who make you feel bad , dont listen negative people , just do it wherever you want to be or what want you that the people says when you die or something like that... fiveth reason that I want to convince you that let me visit your business, is that many people have the chance to explore or visit a business but some people just dont care or they try but , if they cant make real , they give up or they just move to another job or another dreams, but its not how many time you go down , if no how many you get up, for example: I want to visit you business because that interest me and that why I am writing this and give you many examples of me and another people is because I want to learn if you give me the permission, I think that if let me visit your business, I will have more interest and I will have more emotion to be a doctor that is the work that interest and I will be honest with you all this that I wrote is for have your permission for I can visit your business and can know things that I want to know or see things that I never see before , also I want to tell you that , if you give me the opporttunity to visit your business , and hope that you can let me visit your business if is like that , thank you for take a little of your time to read this , I hope that you have a great day.",7,5,6,7,5,5,726,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
154,1718,F17DDEB77A2A,"Most students hope and enjoy a summer vacation after a long school year, but some educators thoughts are completely different as the way they should get their vacations. Although, during the summer break some students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, overall, the summer is a good season to have a school break because of the great weather and the posibilities to get a job for students. Initially, we all know summer is the best season of the year, because it brings more attractions. Of course, the weather is one of the important factors that makes it possible. For example, amusement parks to entertain people, beachess opening, as well as others entertainment places to go visit and have fun. Summer also is a known as a time where family can share moments with others and recover all the energies leaving the stress at home. Also many people likes the summer, beacuse you can practice any sport you want outside, a good way to decrease the percent of obesity and improve our helth. Another advantage of the summer is that we have more sun light during this season than winter, spring or fall, it allowing us to get done more stuff we need to do and being productive with our time. In short, the studentss vacations should be in summer, because is a great season to do many activities and enjoy with friends and family. In addition, as we have more attractions, more personal the companies need, which gives to many people the opportunity to get a job. As a students, a job is helpful in several aspects for good on their lives. For example, maturity, responsability , new experiences and connections-which is very important to your future. Each one prepares you as a person to deal with your every day lives. Also, students have enough time to save their money and keep it for their purposes, it can be for a college or buy whatever they want without the necessity to pay with their parentss money. As a result, students are aviable to gain their own money during the summer, because its offer more opportunities, and also gain new experiences that will help them move fordward. Still, some may say that summer vacations are too long and there should be year-round schools, which would totaly change how long the breaks will be. Then, students can have a balence on their personal lives and scholar lives. The knoledge they aquired is still fresh in their minds so, new stuff to learn will be easier for them and consequently they will obtain good grades. In summary, the significance of the idea to administrate better how long, and the appropiate time for a break is to know if it are gonna affect the student progress, which is the priority of the school. In conclusion, educators wants the best for students,and they just want to find out a better way to rise their progress making them as a better students improving their knoledges. But, it can becomes as an issue because if you are constantly over preassure, and studying all the time without an a consider time to free your mind, it will get you tired. Overall, the summer vacations will keep you distracted with many productive activities during a long break, which are gonna let you back to school more exited and willing to keep study.",7,7,8,6,6,6,3567,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
155,1719,EBEFF43F46EE,"If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because Id always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but its coming sooner than I think. Before I know it Im going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like Im successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful. The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesnt mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer wont come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I cant just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams. The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didnt see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I dont give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day theres one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.",9,8,8,9,7,8,3441,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

They would have everything figured out and it would put less stress on them. For example, If you already know what you want to do it would be easier to apply for collage and you could get a part time job in the career that you chose. Students would know a lot about the career they want to do. In high school they could research things about their career like how much they pay,the conditions they work in, and if it takes a lot of work. They could also talk to people that are in that career and take academy classes. It would make it easier for the student because they would be well educated about the career. For example, when they apply for collage or a job they could say that theyve been studying and have a better understanding of that specific career. It would give them a better chance in getting accepted or getting the job. It would be easier for the student to get a job in the career. The student would have a better chance of getting a job in the career they want to do if they have been learning and taking classes in high school. They would be prepared and wouldnt be scared of not knowing what to do when they get the job. If the career they want to do requires them to go to collage it would be easy for them to pass the classes because they would know mostly everything. For example, when they apply for the job they could see that they finished collage which would give them a high chance of getting the job. In conclusion Students should have a career in mind when they are in high school. It would make it easier for them and their future.

157,1721,CEC1115B69DB,"When i was younger my parents told me to do different things in life. Get out of your comfort zone and go beyond your wildest dreams unless you go and get it yourself. Would you get out of your comfort zone and chase your biggest dreams? I agree with Emerson statement because, how will you get better, being unique from everybody ,and the end result when you accomplish your goal. This is why i agree Emersons statement. PRACTICE.MAKES.PERFECT. I know youve herd this phrase a billion times from your family or friends. This is what Emerson is trying to say. How can someone be better without practicing. Furthermore, how can someone grow without working hard as you can? When i was in middle school i wanted to be in the basketball team. But, i was not good at it. One of my best friend who was in the team told me that he will tech me everything, only if i wanted to work hard and keep practicing with him everyday. We practiced everyday in till tryouts, whenever tryouts came i did really good and i got in the team. ive gotten better from working hard and never giving up on myself. Do something different from everybody else. My father always told me that when i bring up college. He wanted me to do something big. Yet, not only big but unique unlike everyone else. In my last year of high school i was thinking about taking an online class. So, i got into a online course that will not only give me a credit and see how a online class really works. At the start it was hard for me. Because, i was getting out of my comfort zone. Just imagine being in your house or class with no teacher to help you. However, two weeks later ive gotten better at it. Two months later i finished the class with a B+. At the end of all of your hard work and time, it will be worth it. When i was taking my online class i was scared, now i feel like i can do all of my classes online if i wanted to. Because, ive experienced it. Its all because of practicing alone or with somebody,also getting out of your comfort zone. You are going to do something beyond if you tell yourself to do so. Some people say that you dont need to try to do somethings different to grow. Well their wrong heres why, most people cant get used to anything without trying to do so. Moreover, you dont need to master something to grow,because if you try you will now your right from your wrong. In conclusion, If you work hard and try to get out of your comfort zone to try new things in life you will always ascend and be better!",7,5,6,6,6,5,2842,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
158,1722,A336FB5F2623,"Having online classes could be so much helpful and easier for those kids who doesnt leave near the school, or doesnt own car, it could be helpful because student wouldnt had to wait outside for a bus to pick them up, or for someone to take them to school, it could be easier because they could finish their classes from their house they would just need any electronic device and a connection to WIFI. By having online classes I think it could make students life much easier, because if they get sick they can still take their classes and they wouldnt have to worry about making other students sick and there would be less chances of getting sick by other student, student would not have any excuse for not taking their classes, taking online classes could also help those student who are always late to school because they would take their class from their house so any bad weather could not be an obstacle. There are many good thing about taking classes online but there always somethings students would need to give in order to have this benefits and that thing is social life, many students would never see their friends again because everyone has a different mind no everybody has the same goals and not everyone likes the same stuff so in my opinion thats one negative thing of online classes, but there are always a solution the teacher could make a project that could involve working in groups and I think online classes could change students life.",6,6,7,7,7,8,2184,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
159,1723,CEC5B40D1688,"The technology that humans have developed is very advance; a lot of time has been dedicated to it, so society can have a better and easier way to access to technology. However, as all things that are crated by man are not perfect, and it has its positive and negative impacts on people. A lot of those impacts that technology have are negative impacts. For example, you loose the opportunity of interacting with other people, you can get addicted to technology, and you can get lazy, and all these negative impacts affect the new generation the most. The little kids end up playing video games their entire childhood; instead of playing outside, and making new friends. First, technology it is not just to have fun with; you can play video games, but keep in mind that if you abuse of the use of technology you are going to get addicted in a very short period of time. Spending all your time in technology have its consequences. You loose the opportunity to be in contact with the people around you, you can loose your friends if you had any, and most important you can loose your communication that you once had with your parents. You can have hundreds of friends on social media, but it is not worth it if you do not spend time with them. Also one of the most negative impact is that little kids are getting addicted to technology. They are spending most of their childhood playing video games, and doing things that are not going to do any good for them in the future. They should be playing outside with their friends, and enjoying their childhood which is one of the most beautiful things they have. When you are a little kid you are so innocent that you do not have to worry about any problems the adults may have, and you do not have any problems to worry about either. Unfortunately that childhood have to end at some point because nothing last forever, but in the meantime you just have to live your childhood and not worry about any video games. Second, you can use the internet for any need you may have, for there are hundreds of websites of anything you would like use. For example, shopping online, checking out book, and get any information you want. Some other websites are not quite useful like scams, or some websites that contains virus. At some point you may or may not run into a scam website which are used to obtain personal information that you have put online. They can get that credit card information that you used for your online shopping, your social security number, or even your own bank account number. There are people that work on trying to protect your personal information; they use their knowledge for the good of society, but there are also people who uses their skills and try to get your personal information, and use it for their own benefit. Keep in mind that those people can be smarter than you, and they can take every single dollar that you have in your bank account if you put your information at risk. Third, you become lazier when you can get any information you want without making a big effort because you have everything at the reach of your hand by having access to the internet. You got so used to getting things fast and without making an effort, and when you have to wait to get any kind of information you get frustrated, for the fact that you have to go through a whole book, so you can that information. Man have been making your life easier by creating all the technological advances you have now. For example, you do not have to make an effort to wash your clothes, or wash the dishes you have been given all of that, so you have became lazier. At the end technology can result positive impact to society; it has made our life easier, but it has resulted in a negative impact for the new generations. It has made the youth lazier than it was in the old times; teenagers are now addicted to social media, and we are loosing the communication with our parents which is very important to have. Little kids are loosing their childhood in result of the new technological advances that allows them to be playing video games and not going outside to make friends. Technology has put the security of our information at risk by no protecting it enough. Maybe it is the way we use technology, but it has more negative impact than positive impact to our communities around the world.

Some peple believe that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students while other people believe choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big responsibility, you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want. This is important because it is not easy for students have expecifics aspirations and good options of careers at a young age. First, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you have to be sure about what you really want, you have to inform you about others posibilities, you need to know what are the benefits that some careers offer to you. For example, some schools offer to you a tutor and they help you to decided based on your interests and they recommended have differents options and spend a lot of time thinking about what is more covinient for you. Secondly, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you do not have enough time to think about new options.

161,1725,4BA9296EBE9F,"A topic that is debated is if students should do online classes. Some people believe that there should be online classes. They believe that there should be online classes because the students can take there time and feel comfortable where they are . I belive that we shouldnt have online classes because student can ask for help when they need it, Students are better when they work together as a team and you can get extra help after school and before school . Students can ask for help. Teacher can help students when they dont understand something instead of trying to look it up on the internet .Students dont learn from the internet or they will just forget. Online classes is good but what if the students doesnt understand then they would just stay confused. The teacher can show them in person then in a computer screen. If students did online classes what if they dont understand there work because they cant just call there teacher sometimes they dont answer. Students work better when they work together. Group projects can help them in the future when they got to work with other people. They can learn from each other and there mistakes . When the students are in groups they dont do it solo and they can get the more work done. They get to meet new people that they never ever get to talk to and make new friends. Online classes you just listen to the teacher and ask question do the same thing but can never work with other people. There extra help after and before school. Online classes there no before or after school it just the time of your classes. In School the teacher stay after or come before school to help students with their work or the ones that just doesnt understand . The Teacher helps them with homework so they dont have to do it at home and the same with classwork if they dont get it done there after school. There also people who have to do stuff after school so there is before school where they can come early and do there workk. I believe that we shoulnt have Online classes because student can ask question,student have more fun doing group activity and if the students need help they have after and before school to get extra help. Online classes isnt really necessary it wouldnt effect anything. Teacher are more helpful then computer.

162,1726,E88DDF2C81EB,I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving a good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too. I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Names team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play. On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad. over all positive attitude is the key to success.

164,1728,11E9348F5072,"In this prompt we are going to talk,and choose if we accomplish more by doing more things in the world,or does inactivity also serve a purpose or not. We all have a different opinion when it comes to things like this choosing between something different. Well we actually do accomplish more if we do more things for an example say someone wants to become a doctor we go to collage, we do things,and we learn, after doing all that we all accomplish something because we all did something to succeed what we love. Therefore a reason why doing more makes a person accomplish something is because doing more,and learning more teaches someone things they never learned before. So by that we mean that once a person learns something they have never done before they start loving it and start doing it. Other reasons and examples why doing more is better is because when the person does more they have all the energy to do it which is honestly a good thing because once a person learns something that person just wants to go to collage,graduate, and succeed which is something we all want. Here is an example why it is that we study a lot and try to learn things it is because we want to grow up,succeed on what we love doing,and also to accomplish new things we have always wanted to try. When you start learning new things,and get the hang of it all everything will just become easier for someone,and also things they always wanted to do will just become easier for that person too. Another thing is that when we keep doing things it will just be done faster like it said in the prompt something Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle. It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" which is honestly facts we do get things done faster if we just keep doing it, if we just keep trying without stopping, and i mean yes taking breaks on important things is good because we all do need breaks at some point to be honest but also getting things done is better and once someone gets things done they feel really proud of themselves, all of us do because it is a good feeling to finish things that were hard,and stressful.

So now you ask more then one person about something you dont know what to do or if you have trouble solving something other people can help you and give you good advice and other can give you advice but are bad choices so just ask someone for help or ask someone you trust and will help you.

Well its good to ask for help because some one can give you advice on what to and what to not do and asking to much people can give you way much ideas on what to do,This helps so much people that needs help because they are like asking people for help and they are helping us to do better choice then a bad choice, Every one can give you a advice on whats better for you problem or question and it will help so much like Parents, Family , and Friends. Kids can ask advice to everyone even there Teacher, Counselor , And mostly there parents theyre always be there if you need help and need advice and they will give you a really better idea, But what i think is better for you guys is ask an a adult then a student just to not make a bad idea and start doing things your not suppose to, So kids just talk to a grown up and they will help you with the advice you need. We all sometimes need advice by someone so just ask and youll get a advice you need and everyone will help you help your self dont think that only you need advice we all have something to tell a person and give us there opinion, We are like asking them what they gonna do if they need a advice and is passing the same thing we passing. When the person you talked about gived you a advice youll think about it and if its a good choice you do it and everything comes to peace thats why i can help you if you ask for an advice and it will help you in the fueature too so just ask for advice and theyll give you it. What if a friend dosent give you an advice? Then tell your pearents or an adault a school or work to help you, Did you know older people need advice too?

We need advice in somethhing we have done bad or you dont know what to do or you have problems you need some advice from someone for they can help you on it thats really important helping someone that needs a advice.

What happen is that you will get depress or get stressed thinking on what to do, And if you get depress if can be dangoures youll be always be upset wont want to do anything you wont even want to eat or anything thats why if you need a adivce ask someone to help you and youll be so much better.",5,5,6,7,5,5,660,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

168,1732,F5817C081342,"Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals youve set for yourself. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. That shouldnt bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. In my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after. When I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self. The other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. On that article it said ""First women Pilot from El Salvador"" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where shes at. It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to. I admire my mother, shes gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. Before she came to the United States her mother didnt want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fine, the day my aunt was about to leave to Mexico my mother begged her to take her. My aunt would deny and deny her until she finally said yes. My mom packed up her stuff and left with my aunt behind her mothers back, but before she left she left a note for her mother saying if she doesnt leave now theyll never have a better future. My mother has walked thousands of miles and has nearly starved to death to get to where she is now. She worked her head off trying to make enough money to support her family, she had three jobs and as soon as she clocked out of one she would walk miles to get to the other one. Years later my grandma got her Visa and was able to come visit, she regretted doubting her and apologized for not believing in her. If my mom didnt have a positive mind set and if she listened to my grandma she would still be in El Salvador; washing her clothes in the river, eating beans and eggs everyday, and earning six dollars a day. She has a better life now then she had before, but she still has more to accomplish and I am here to help her. With her positively she can go far. Therefore a positive attitude is the key to success, negativity wont take you anywhere all it does is let you watch others have fun while they enjoy life. Positivity allows you to set goals and to accomplish them. Many people have met their goal by believing in them selves, no matter how difficult it is they keep on pushing. I believe attitude does have an impact on life choices, if you put no effort on a task your set to do, that task will never be done or itll turn out horribly. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.

We never know when is the best time to do something or to get something so be patient. my parent told me that""good things will come to you just be patient"" Although, after failing once most of the people lose hope and stop trying. Nevertheless, it is not easy to start over because it gets boring working on same thing over and over and people give up on their dreams. To begin, failing help people to gain more experience. When we do same thing over again it makes our work easier. For example when we fail the test at school and we have to retake it we already know what mistake we did for the test so we do not repeat it. This shows that we will try harder when we get the chance to do it again. Clearly we will be successful next time. Furthermore, we learn not to give up when we fail for the first time. Giving up is not the best thing to do after failing. For instance, we can make a whole new plan and ways to do our work. This shows that we are going to be successful next time. For example, when I was 13 I had to take a test in order to get in to the high school that I wanted but, the test was hard and I failed the test i said I will not take it again because it is hard and I cant do it but my sister said that i cant give up and I have to take it again and again and finally I pass the test for the second time. Moreover, it teaches us to be patient. when we fail it is the best thing for us to wait for the good time to start over and to get what we want. obviously, it will take time to start all over and do everything one by one but it will help us to learn how to be patient and to deal with problems better than before. Clearly we will get what we want sooner or later after trying hard. Overall, failure is a key to success. We will not get to success if we do not fail once. It is not something to be ashamed of. In conclusion, gaining experience is the gift of failing. We start working hard and not to give up. We learn to be patient and chase our dreams. The best thing we can do is to be happy and joyful even after failing. Everything has its own time so be patient.

170,1734,48292985CC59,"Well I want to start saying that the first impressions about people can change but if the impressions change is because something happen. Im saying it because of some of my experiences with other people that I met and change my impressions about them. Sometimes people dont change,instead of saying that people change your impressions about them maybe you need to know your self first and see what is happening also you need to known why that person change your impressions because maybe something sad or bad is happening on their life and you dont know it. So let me tell you an experience that happen to me a few moths ago so I met this girl and she was very nice with me and I start thinking that she was that nice with everyone and no I was wrong she only was that nice with me so I decide to date her so I tell her if she want go to see a movie next weekend and she tell me, yes! and I say great so like 3 days before going to see the movie she start acting weird and I ask her if she was OK? and she tell me yes,so the next day I start talking with her and she tell me what was happening and she tell me that her mother was sick and she was sad,so she tell me everything that was happening and I understand why she was acting weird. In conclusion my impressions about her it was starting to change but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life,because you dont know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening. So I think you should ask that person what is happening and then you decide what are you going to do.

171,1735,D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad. Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they wont be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they wont be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out whats good or bad for them economically. I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she cant get a boyfriend because she doesnt know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me shes having economical problems because shes doesnt know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world. In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world. ",8,7,7,8,8,7,3013,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
172,1736,BE28A2EEAE06,"There are many kinds of enjoyable educational activities. Completing a science experiment is the most enjoyable activity. its the most enjoyable activity because doing a science experiment teaches kids to have more responsiblity on completing something. it teaches them to work hard together and have responsibility. My favorite thing about doing a science experiment is teamwork. I think that working together is important because it teaches kids to bond like family,talk to each other about it, and learn what mistake you made about it. Even if you dont make a mistake you still learn different things at the end, like bonding and learning how the experiment was supposed to be done. The activity is enjoyable because my friends and I get to do experiments together as a group. We assign a person to do a different task so everyone can work. Our teacher tells us to clean up after ourselves for her next classroom so she could get more organized. Doing a science experiment is helpful because people will start to like learning about science. This activity also makes you understand better as you are doing the experiment.

173,1737,C3C1D527011F,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. That could be a good opportunity for students if they finish school early they can be more independent, also can make more money a early age and build a magnificent future, another good thing its they can buy whatever they want, and dont have to be necessary ask their parents for money also save money for their career at college. At school we can see different kinds of age some guys are older that others, so maybe some students want to finish school a early time, If the students finish school early they can be more independent, and see how life goes life isnt easy and all of us one day will learn how to be more independent. Be independent it is a responsibility because you have to take care about something as; pay some bills, if you have car, well take care about the insurance, for some reason you live by yourself have to pay where do you live, and other responsibilities. Second, make money a early age is a amazing thing to do because you will prepare for the future your goal is finish school, and maybe that would require extra effort like take courses during the summer, or work in the evenings to make up things that you need to do in another class, maybe that require extra work. At some point, you may not able to take elective courses but that decision is made by yourself, if your goal is finish school early you have to leave some things to get what you want. All dedication that you put, for sure you would have a recompense in the future, also dont have to worry for money because you are working hard for that. Finish school early that can help you to be more successful like work for your own things, so if you need something you dont have ask a your parents for money; to get what you want, and another good thing is you can earn, save money for you career in college.

However, everyone choose what they want, some things would benefits your future and if you wanna make it work out in less time you can make it possible, there always another way to find out what you want, need, and to be a succeful person in the future.

174,1738,7F4706C105DE,Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. For an example when I was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me whats up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didnt surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach. After a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. But it was the final game everything changed the team we went up against had stronger and bigger players they first took out are running back with a neck injury so that left me playing two positions. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me. He asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i went back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up. Coach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday. How do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it. ,8,6,7,7,7,6,1678,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. Im not saying all students cant attend online classes at home, but most cannot. Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i cant speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them. School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You cant forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. Another reason being home schooled isnt a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them. School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges.

176,1740,21B100A503DC,"Churchill statement is right because failing in life is part of succeeding. Those obsticals you go through in life are part of who you become and how you handle those obsticals. It gives some type of motivation to keep moving forward and get to whatever goal it is. My example is when i got pregnant my junior year and when I found out i just wanted to drop out because I was still a kid myself and I kept thinking how people would look at me or what would they say, but I already had an idea. My parents didnt even support me so what motivation did I have? I had myself and my son. I took that as my motivation, yes it was difficult especially after I delivered and going back to school because I was very behind. Of course a lot of friends stopped talking to me but that just proves whos there for you and whos not. I was starting a new chapter in my life and Im not saying having my son was a mistake but it was just at the wrong time; cant change the past though, you just have to keep moving forward. Here I am now my senior year, eight more months until I graduate and Im proud of myself because I am a mother now and Im still going to school, I didnt let that stop me from getting my education and Im planning to go to college too because all I want is the best for my son and myself; its not me I have to think about now, I have another responsibility to look after for. There are many examples of failing in life and later on succeeding but this is one I went through, I had to grow up fast but it made me the person I am today. Just because of one mistake you make in life doesnt mean your life is over, its probably just the beginning, we are human!

If you take a video conferencing this will help you to understand your teacher because a video conferencing explain you what you need to do. And also you will see what is your teacher teaching you.

School year require have 315 days of classes and you have to be in the school for about 6 to 8 hours per day. And also they need to complete some credits to graduated. If you want to finish school you have to complete this credits. To have complete this credits you have to take some classes that are require to complete those credits. Reason 2, why students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is because if they studied at home they can go to doctors appointment. There are 70% of students that doesnt come to the school because they have doctor appointment and they mostly are absent. Attendants is very important in the school because if you want to have good greats you have to come every day.

183,1747,97A0FFE91A3E,Why i agree with the school board planning to add one and a half hours to school is because it would give us more time to learn in each of our classes and it would benefit everyone. my reason for why i agree with the school boards planning to add one hour and a half is because if we are doing a worksheet or any notes and we dont finish the notes because of how less of a time we have in the class and with that that extra hour we can get some more time to finish work we need to finish. Another reason why i think that would be a really good idea is because it would not only give us more time to finish and do work but it would also be very helpful to the teachers. because it would give them more time to teach us and finish things they need to do. and Teachers wont have to worry about not finishing their lesson because of how much time they have in that class. I also believe that if we do extend the school day longer we would learn more because of the extra time we are getting. and it would give us more time to learn. if we dont know how to do that subject the Teacher would have more time to go over it again and tell us step by step how to do it and help us to improve and get better at it. Another good reason is because that extra hour can help us get better at the subject you dont like or can help you get better grades because the Teachers can show you how to do it and you wont struggle in test because the Teacher reviewed it with you and it would benefit you because you would start getting better at it. The extended hour can benefit the teachers a lot because it would give them more time for planning and doing stuff they need to do and what that extra hour we can make up all the work that we didnt finish. The problems if we do not get the extra hour is Teachers wont have time to get through their lesson because they wont have much time. and students wont be able to get help on what they need help on. another reason is that students will fall behind because they wont have much time to get through the subject they need to finish and they will have to finish the next day while other people will be finished with that subject. These are my reasons why i would agree on the school extending the school day one hour and a half longer because it would benefit the students and the Teachers. ,5,5,6,6,4,5,2007,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Trying new things helps you to understand that you can do more things,everything depends on you if you really wants to do something that you like, just do it , never do the opinions of others people because is only you, the people cant control you life everything. The thing that you already done and you was doing and everything was wrong,what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you already done but you didnt get it thats doesnt mean that you life is done or you will never grow thats wrong, when youre sure that what you want youll be fairing for that thing that youll lose for many times but youll be fairing for that and youll not get tired until you get your dream.

186,1750,0756FC69B810,"I would like to talk about the interesting quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote,and how he tell us to ""Determine never to be idle."" He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life. First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we dont take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we dont gonna know how much can be done if we dont try to do the things that we wants or needs to done. Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive. Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we dont imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we dont see what we are doing at the time. Thats the power of inactivity. We have to see clearly and make a decision of what we decide to choose. In conclusion the interesting idea of Thomas Jefferson of write this quote, was a amazing idea ever,because at this time reading his thought we can see the importance of be determinate and be someone who knows how much may be done if he is doing what he needs to do, to have the right to accomplish much more than he thinks,and have the power to choose between doing something or just stay inactive.",7,5,7,5,5,6,98,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

If the curfew adopt the teenagers, the situation will change to the better. the council said the teenagers dont have to be in the street after 10 p. m. in the weekdays because they want the teenagers out of troubles. and they found teenagers in the street after 10 P.M. thats mean is breaking the law. that warning for the people because sometimes the bad people walk around have a knife or have a gun these people can kill someone kidnapping anyone. Or someone make a bomb and try to put it in street. and also is danger because maybe someone drank a lot and he drove the car maybe can hit anybody by the car thats why the police check the city a lot of time to make sure no bad things will happen and also the police check the city because if someone have something wrong they will help them. if the teenagers dont break the law this will help the police to try make the city safe the safety in city is so important. Like example that happen with me when I was 15 years old I was walking in the street at 11 p. m. and I was going to my home I see one man behind me but I thought is regular man but he was have a knife and he said to me give anything you have I was have my wallet had on it my ID and not too much money and I dont have anyone in the street to help me and he took my phone and he told me leave and dont look behind you I ran away because he was almost gonna kill me. be in your home early to be safe. The police doesnt want to control on you but he want to be safely. because the world is not safe now the world have a lot of bad people.

And my friend is dead all of these to show you how the world is not safe. the police have a lot of situations with the bad people. and if you look at the countries is not safe the reason is because every day around the country you will find everyday someone killed.

Students would benefit from being able to attend school from home because you can stay at home and by staying at home you can wake up late for school. There is some students that hate waking up early for school thats one of the reasons of having the opportunity to take your classes in online. Staying at home you can be eating whatever you want there is not going to be teachers telling you that you cant eat. There might be people that doesnt have the transportation to go school and get in time for school and because children doesnt like waking 6 AM in the morning. That chance to take classes at online many students would prefer having online classes. Other reason why students would benefit by attending classes from home is because there is not distraction at your home you can be at your room alone without no one to distract you when youre taking your classes or when youre taking a very important test. By being alone at home you can concentrate more about the things that youre learning because your friends are not there with you to distract you with another things. Like I said there is not benefit too of having classes in online because students doesnt have friends or a group of friends to share their ideas. There is children that may need a group or a friend to talk about their ideas in classes or maybe you have a problem with something and you dont have no one to help you ,and by having not classmate it might be boring being alone. students may need tools from school for example you need to read a book and you dont have one because you just dont own books at home and thats why I think it would not benefit because in school you have a library you can go there to find a book and there is different types of books students can pick. Other reason why it would not benefit the students is because they can cheat. students can cheat at everything because you dont have a teacher that is taking care that the student dont cheat at a test. If the students doesnt want to do a class he can can pay someone to make it for then ad pass it for them. Different people might have another opinion about taking classes at home but I think there is benefit and not benefit because students can use this opportunity to waste their time or take advantages about having classes at home.

Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. I strongly disagree with this prompt because once we enter high school we are transitioning to a bigger school with more new subjects that catches our attention. My reasons for disagreeing is that I was once a rising ninth grader and I would be unhappy with the career I wanted in my freshman year. For example when I first came into high school as a ninth grader I wasnt sure of what I wanted to be once I graduate. Now I am a senior at Generic_school and I have two option to choose from. In my perspective I believe that at a young age mindset changes; you find new interest in things and also our mind isnt fully developed at ages fourteen or fifth teen; we arent mature wisely on what we want. I think the student should started preparing them self once theyre in junior year which is when theyre a eleventh grader. My reason for saying that is because youre close to graduating and need to start planning your future, looking for scholarship, and making sure you want the career youve chosen for a long period of time. I dont think its a bad idea but i wouldnt agree with it because I know how this generation is like and we need more teacher to start talking to them seriously about life after high school. These past year a huge amount of student have dropped out of school because they do not feel like they have support from teacher, friends, or even their own parents; or maybe the student think they cant afford college; not many teacher talk to them about financial help or support.",7,6,6,6,6,6,3300,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Although some students will dont want graduate early because they are not ready to being a university life or alone life, nevertheless for others students is a good choice being her life or overtake her life, for example they have more opportunities for study a long profession like Doctor, students will have more time to doing think they like as to travel, and if they want can make a family. Students make a complied because they want to study a long profession and they dont have some many time to doing all thing they want. The students said normally the people finish high school between the 17 or 18 and they know are young, but some time they need a break before to enter the college and if one student want to study a long profession he or she dont have so many time to take a break and study a profession like a doctor than is during like 5 or 6 years. This significant than student need more time to doing one thing fun before to enter the college. Additionally in the future may be they need another break after the finish college I opportunity the young people like travel too much and know others countries, they own country, they want watch new things, they know different s people, different language, different accent or pass free time with her family, friend, or play any sports. This is important because although they have time when they graduate at 18 or 19. Maybe if they finish high school when they have 16 have more time to graduate the college early and doing so many thing they like to do. Another students want finish early high school to do others things so different like make a family and find a good job they like so much. So many adolescences think in money since so young , they need money, money for buy some material thing like a car, an apartment, so many clothes so expensive. This is important because the adolescences think finish most early high school is like they said "" if I graduate the high school a the 16 then a began to work like than i will have 21 i have all the thing I need for begin an alone life, then will want to married get a big family. In conclusion, the this a good program of some schools than students can graduate in three years, sometime students need more time in her life for doing thing they like an the opportunities for choice a some long profession and have time to do thing they like or job for a better life.

192,1756,F1596AB60E72,"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?. Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time. Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on. Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo, assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time. Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay, but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus , it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group. In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful. ",6,7,8,7,6,6,3559,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

194,1758,F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home. After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine. They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they wont be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home. Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away. In conclusion The school board shouldnt add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldnt be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.

Number one we finish the assignement alot faster. Number two everyone is working on something different. Number three everyone is helping each other if we struggling on something. There is the bad part about working in a group is that there is alot of distration, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. Now lets look at the good part on woekinmg on the assignment alone. number one there is no distractions getting in between you working. Number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. Number three you can ask the teacher on how sheor he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. The bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. the other part is that is that you have to do all the wrok by your self and have to rely on your self. Other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struugling kinda the same thing like how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you wnat it to be looking linke or how you want it to be done. Ones again for a student like me i rather work in a group than by myself because knowing my self i wont finish my work or the assingment. In a group i can have one part on the assignment that i have to finish. You can say i am picking on working in a group to do less work, and you are right because its going to be done instead of not doing the whole assignment. so for my coclusion i would want to work in a group instead of working alone because ""team work makes the deam work.""",7,6,6,7,7,7,3691,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
197,1761,D5588B5DD6FF,"Once The great artist Michelangelo said that ""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelos said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that. First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs. Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. At their junior year Generic_Names friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal. Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the danger will not be as big as it appears. As you can see, Michelangelos said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Not always setting our aim too high and falling short it is what it means to survive in this world.",8,7,9,7,6,8,2970,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

199,1763,92B8F2F85C44,"Although some say ""Unless you have try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Based on my experiences I do agree to Emersons statement because life isnt easy you have to try new things in life, you have to risk yourself to walk through that bigger path and try not to look back to something you couldnt accomplish back than, instead look up, stand striaght and tell yourself ""I know I can master new/harder things that are to come my way."" Some say if ""You dont try to do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow."" How are you suppose to grow if you havent master something you cant accomplish? Life puts us in a sitution where not everything is going to be perfect, not everything is going to be rainbows and butterflies you have to challange youself, you have to show everyone that just cause you messed up once doesnt mean your going to make the same mistake again. You have to go through the rain to get to the rainbow, you have to be prepared for the big situtions that are coming your way. You have to learn how to handle the bigger situiton to know how to handle the smaller sitution when it comes to you. Dont let smaller things effect you at the end of the day the sun is still shinny brighter than ever, challange yourself so you can master and accomplish the situtions. Therefore if you cant accomplish something youve tried so much you shouldnt give up but also dont stress about it too much either. If you think what your doing is the best than dont look back and keep doing what youve already started, life will be harder sometimes but its up to you to show that you can master things you havent been through. People might think you cant handle what your going through, people will laugh at you for not being able to master something that is easy for them but harder for you, you cant just stop trying just because you feel like you cant no more. Take a deep breath and I promise that at the end of the day youll be happy because you master something you thoght you couldnt handle, but not only that youll be happy because you didnt give up and you showed all these people that didnt beileve in you that you did it! Others say that ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this side of the argument because its honestly the truth you have to master new things or youll never see yourself growing, for an example if you just had an argument with your sigificate other and you break up with him/her your really just throwing things down the drain instead of sitting down to talk to that person to try to solve what went wrong. Try to master things so you grow not just kick things down the road and think that their going to come back to you. Maybe that was the first break up and he/she actually wants to break up, are you going to let her/him to let you go just like that or are you going to ask him/her for a reason? Get on their shoes, sometimes things happen for a reason and if what ever your going through hits you in the back of the head is for a reaon, dont confuse yourself on accomplishing something and showing off. In conclusion some things might be harder for you than others but you shouldnt end up backing up and telling yourself you cant do it, that its too hard. Instead you should do the opposite and tell yourself that you are better than what you think you is and that your going to master lots of things with or without someone by your side telling you ""You can do it."" This is my side of the statement I agree with and the way I look at things when I feel like I cant master big/small situtions.

201,1765,C6555F21F7CD,"I believe that Winston Churchills quote,""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is true because after you make the mistake you learn how not to make that mistake again. The only way to learn how to be successful is to make a mistake. I think that you should always isten to your elders because they have been threw rough and happy days. When we are little, we always think that our parents are being really strict, but theyre only trying to keep us happy. I have made alot of mistakes when I was a pre-teen and I still make mistakes now,but at the end i realize that I was wrong. I was thirteen when I got my first phone and my parents always told me to not have social media till im sixteen. The only reason why my parents said,""no"", to social media was because they didnt want me to get hacked by people. All though, my parents said no to socail media i got it anyways. After couple weeks of having social media, someone decided to hack my snapchat. At that point, I realized my parents were always right. My parents have made mistakes before too. When I waa a baby, my parents took me to my grandparents house for the first time. After we got to my grandparents home, my parents forgot to close the door behind us. So, I crawled out of the house and they didnt see me. After that, this guy saw me crawling down the streets and there were cars driving by me. So, the guy carried me to his shop to see if anyone comes to find me. After couple minutes, my mom realized I wasnt there so she ran out of the house to find me and than couple blocks down she saw in someones shop. My parents always checked if the door was closed after that incident. Always keep in mind that you shouldnt do anything without thinking of the affects. If you not sure if its right or wrong, then you should ask someone for their opinion. If that doesnt work out than your probably doing something wrong. If you do something wrong then people will change the way they look at you. It better to keep in mind that your family and friends have faith in you.

202,1766,5DEDECE96044,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. cellphones has become the major problem in schools for students and for teachers. I think that cellphones should not be allowed in the classroom because students dont do the work that they suposted be doing and schools already have tecnology to use. Cellphones shouldnt be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes. Also, cellphones shouldnt be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones. schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do. However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not. Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they cant live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want. In conclution, I think that cellphones shuldnt be allowed in the class room. students have to learn how to live with out their phone because graduate and not fail classes is more important than be texting their friends all the time. Also, for teacher that let students to use their phone for any work I think thats not a good idea because the teacher is helping the student to get distracted by using their phone and not passing their classes.",8,8,8,7,7,6,1212,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

These are my thoughts that I have: First, I can see that they dont have a brake to relax (except winter brake and some holly days, sometimes teachers give students homework for winter brake) , they are always studing hard, so they get stress. second, usually they have a lot of homework, thats one of the reason that they dont really have time to their families and friends; they can get depress too and start feeling alone, thats what usually happen to me. After that, they are done with the school early, so they have one year to chill or may be have a part time job, except that their parents make them join to college early. They keep studing, and then sometimes people have to move from house, because the college is at another state or city, so they have to rent a room close to the college. In conclussion, graduate in less time is better and worst at the same time, but people know what they do with their lifes, in my opinion I prefer to graduate like a normal student, in four years.

204,1768,C71E90669DFA,"Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Dukes statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it. My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again. Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know whats the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and dont create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we cant make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life. My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other.

205,1769,B3493FBE6476,"Distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from home. There are many students that fail the grade just because they dont attend their classes at school. This is a great way for students to still take classes and learn more their education. The generation from now arent as motivated as generations before. Theres might be a some people that wont agree with this statement because they probably think going to school is better than taking classes online or conferencing from home. Some people may say that it isnt a great idea for schools to offer distance learning for students especially the parents. Most parents would want their kids to go to school and take classes because they think its better for them. They probably think that theyre are ways to cheat if they take classes online. Some parents would want their kids to interact with other students and not just be home all the time. I agree on all the reasons why they student shouldnt take distance learning as an option but I think otherwise. Its a great option for students because there are many student that fail or drop out of school just because they didnt attend school. If students had the option to take classes online from home then it would give them a second chance to pass and graduate so they wouldnt give up. It even may help other students understand the curriculum more. The generation now are giving up at such a young age just because they dont even want to attend their classes at school. This is why its a great idea for schools to offer distance learning so students wont just give up and drop out. Having the opportunity to take online classes from home with probably help those students the dont want to attend school. The students would take classes from their homes and learn the same information they would learn at school. In conclusion, I think it would benefit many students if schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Its a great way for students who dont like attending school most of the time. It would be a great advantage for students to have that offer of distance learning, it woud make a huge difference for the generation of students now a day.

206,1770,B794B3C07254,"It is my pleasure to take this great opportunity to express my view or opinion on the above topic; which is positive attitude is the key to success in life?.First and foremost i would like to briefly talk about the term attitude, it can be shorty defined as a good or bad conduct or manner ones shows in public or the kind of act you put up which is either good or bad. If we really take good look at how people live,attitude is the most relevant thing they mostly pay attention to, lets talk about work school. WORK OR SCHOOL: If we take good look at this two places, we can see or sort of attitudes aspects, either good or bad that is coming from the students,teachers and many more , showing good attitudes towards others shows how respect you are and what kind of family you came from, most people had a good relationship with others because of their good attitude they have acquire from school or at home,students with good attitude are more easily to associate themselves among others, and become very good friends , teachers really love students who always show a good attitude, sometimes too they can earn some gift from others. HOME OR CHURCH: This really take places in our various houses, showing good attitude to your parents or it can anyone ,mostly help to gain favors from people you might not even know they might be your futures helper, because there is a saying nobody knows tomorrow, for instance you went out and some random person ask if you can help him or her to find a place but your attitude did not let him even to ask you anymore ,but imagine some few years later came and you met such same person that ask for your assitance but your attitude was not good at all, maybe he is a manager at your dream job you have prayed to work there, so as soon as you get there you saw he is the one who is going to interview you do you think he will be willing to gave you such opportunity even though you qualified the answer is no he will find any means to let you not get that job , your bad attitude ruin up your whole life, this goes to church too,having positive attitude at church draws human being more closer to God and attract more blessings from him as well. POSITIVE ATTITUDE AMONG INDIVIDUALS; Last but not the least is the kind of attitude we gave among ourselves ,this has become a daily rampant that need to failure to get help from other people, imagine you had like 4 close friends but they are be asking for your help on something but some of them attitude is very pathetic , but insisted they really need your help and what you have on you can only help few of them, so would you go ahead and help those who had a negative attitude the answer may be no,because you going to help those of your friends whose had a good attitude first before you assist them too , this really tell us having positive attitude can really gave you so many opportunities or advantages. THESE ARE SOME MERITS OF POSITIVE ATTITUDE: 1. It creates good interpersonal relationship among individual. 2. It easily to get favor from other people. 3. It always bring peace among others. 4. It really depict the kind of family you came from or the type of trained you have acquired. THESE ARE SOME VITAL OR MAJOR REASON WHY WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE A POSITIVE ATTITUDE; 1. B ecause it enable individuals to always have a good name in any places they found their selves in and, it also promote economic living, because you individuals really knows good your attitude is so therefore they will always be proud to share their issues or problems with you without been hesitate. 2. It attract blessings from God , because the bible is even against anyone who does not show a positive attitude among his or her neighbor, and can make your life been successful with the help of blessings you getting from your creator. HOW POSITIVE ATTITUDE HELP US IN OUR OWN LIVES; having positive attitude really help individuals a lot because this earth we live in everything is about attitude even assuming you apply for a job and they monitor you for awhile then later realized you had a bad attitude, do you think the person who is in charge of that work will be willing to hired you the answer is no, because no one can hired someone who has a negative attitude, so imagine now you had positive attitude everything is excellent you even feel proud of yourselves you do not even care wherever you might find yourself in because your attitude is really good and it can gave you so many chances in life that you think you not even to have it, you can also become a remodel to some people , they might even look at you and learn from you , so therefore is very good to have a positive attitude and move free wherever you go , some people really pay attention to people attitudes even more than everything in this word. CONCLUSION; Due to time factor i would like to bring my above oppinous to an end and i am pretty sure it may be taking into consideraton and publish it for other people to have access to read and if they had to made some changes in their lives they can surely do so to it.

207,1771,CB7F46E1BDF6,"Having a good attitude in a difficult time is a great way to stay calm and talk to others with respect. I witnessed one day a new kid came to my school with attitude he was giving out everyone what they want like many people asked him where he was coming from he said ""Im coming from New York"". He genially answer their question with respect and calmness like one kid asked how old are you, He replied saying that ""Im 14 years old"" Even though Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldnt do much. He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasnt feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone hes talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So thats why having a attitude not always means bad.

208,1772,16005A45A20A,"Theres 90% of people in the world that wants to be someone in life, but some people never had the chance or some people just gave up on school,and now they regret it. In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that thats not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we dont do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if its really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in. I want to be able to see if the career I want to take its really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldnt just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasnt really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldnt do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever theres a problem with my moms car or my dads car, we go to him. This is what Im talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I dont want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me. If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career Im interested in. It does not only help me to see if Its really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didnt know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, Im attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because Ive heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because thats what he is, but I told him that wasnt really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldnt be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since hes the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friends house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me. There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so Ill just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you dont like the job you are doing everyday, then you wont ever be happy with what you are doing. Thats why you have to find a job thats really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people thats going to need your help. This is why its important to know what you really want for yourself. I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if Its not what I want, then thats okay because Ive learned new things that will always help me in life. If its not for me, then theres always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know theres more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. Its not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want. ",8,6,6,6,7,7,300,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

On the other hand, we have the people that dont have time to do things after school. An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People dont always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they dont have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that dont have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish. I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I dont have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might dont have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it wont starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club. Most of the students wont have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I dont think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I dont think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework. It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that dont have time after school wont struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that. Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers. Everyone gets to finish their homework and no one has worrys about not finishing their homework and have a little bit of more free time in the afternoon.",8,6,7,7,7,6,2516,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. It would help the students who had a bad experience at school. Students who are in their comfort zone will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. Some may argue that student should not attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students that are at home will most likely be distracted, and will not finish their agenda. Some students will have a hard time teaching their selves. Also it would not give the students, the chance of experiencing what it is like in school. It would really benefit the students, who are not socialize and have problems contacting with other students or teachers. Every students grew up differently, and also some other students have had a bad childhood experienced and it reflected on how they act in their current life, by giving them a chance to study where they are comfortable at would give them a chance to show what they can really do, because not many students have that many option or chances to show their full potential. They can not do that by having to stay in school, and force them selves to socialize to other students or teachers it would all just be a distraction. Also, it would help the students who had a bad experienced at school. Students who experienced getting bullied at school can caused them to stop going or the will to study and be successful in life. Bullying even nowadays still have so much impact on why some schools are really not on their high standards. And it showed that students are highly affected by it. It showed that it is a nightmare to some students, but now having the online classes will pull them away from that and really focused on their studies. Furthermore, students who are in their comfort zone, will likely be able to focused and not have any distraction. By having that comfortless and being in your zone of learning, will highly benefit you to show your potential. Being in the right environment also help students focused. Students who is really serious about being successful and have that high standards are more likely to be successful. Family can also motivate them, to keep on pushing even though it might be hard for them but having your family by your side can really motivate you to keep on pushing. Therefore, i really believed that, students should really have the option to take online classes or video conferencing. by just having that it would benefit lots of student, who are having problems being socialize to other students or teachers. it would help the students who had a bad experience in school. And it also would benefit the students who are in their comfort zone, and being able to focused and having that chance would increase the chances of more students will be successful.",6,6,7,6,6,6,2245,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
213,1777,7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day. Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with peoples attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults dont take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isnt easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through whats stop you from being happy. Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday. Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again. In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

A test can be enjoyable because you can proof that you smarter than other people by getting a high score and thats fun and proof the people that they were wrong about you. Life is enjoyable because you have a lot of memories that happen since you were born until whatever age you are now but time is relative so dont stop having fun in life. Enjoyment can come from many things like getting a goal in a game, a hundred in a test, accomplishing something for the first time but there are many things that can bring joy in life. As you get older you learn new things, you get wiser but also you have more befits and disadvantages. For example, adults and older people have money and with money you can get things and spent it in anything you want and plus yall can drive and go places and thats what people enjoy too. A huge disadvantage for adults is that they have to work for 8 or more hours but either way imagination never gets old but instead it gets newer. Adults and kids or teens however yall want to call us but we are the same the only difference that we are younger but we all have a imagination awake or hibernating and thats what allows joy in peoples life even for the people that barely have it awake. Everyone needs to live life at its fullest being joyful trying new things like sports, music, or even puzzles but time is relative you stopping yourself because you think your getting old but thats not the case do everything you want to do before time runs out for you and youll leave with regret but everyone need to wake up there inner kid inside of them and start living life without regrets try new things, talk to new people, spend more time with your parter or family etc. but make new memeries and be jolly and have such enjoyable life to new things youll try.",7,6,7,7,7,6,3467,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early . The students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years. Also some school districts dont offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts dont have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing. The student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students dont have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who dont have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life. The students who are a school dont have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school dont take a career because they dont have the money to pay it, or their parents dont have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you dont have the money enough to take it. In some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life. Some students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they dont even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students dont have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life. In conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.

If a student is doing terrible in school and he is in so many extracurricular activities, The School should take action right away. If the student has no time to study and involved in so many activities the student is defenitely going trough something. For example: The students familymight be going trough rough times and he does not want to come home early, and Also he might be avoiding someone at home. Second reason Schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities. because the Student has no time to study and the student is in so many school activities that is going to result to a bad grade. If the student has bad grades the Student is going to be stress about school and The student might ended up dropping out of school. If the student drop out of highschool it is not going to be easy for him to find a good paying job.

Overall,some peoplesay its good idea to student work in this time because you can save money from know until you be a man. First,some peolple say its bad idea. For example,the student when he see the money he will not care any more about school and his grade will go down and maybe he will repeted the year again. Student is bad to work beacause if he have friend they doesnt work and the guy who work see his friend not working and he just work they will have a big problem. However, is bad idea to student work know becausehe will not care any more about his high school. Second,some people think is good idea to student in high school to work know. For example,when the student work from know and he save money he will come a man to go to colloge he will have a good money to go to the college,For example,student or other gay works from they younger they can save a good money and when get like a man to get married they can look up the money and get it fast they can buy a house very fast and he doesnt get worried about the money.

For example, if you work after school like from 4pm to 12am you will get tired and you leave far away you will have to sleep from 1am to 7am. Then you will have to wake up around 7am and go to school so your not can get to much of sleeping.

Altough,like when you work and get like one thousand dollar from the work you give your dad a good money and he can pay and when you see your dad happy and your gud is happy from you will life all life in a good way.

221,1785,2DDFC0DFC442,"Highschool is a big step in the growth of students. The step from middle school to highschool is a very diffecult one. As kids start to grow older there minds also change and sometimes the dreams they had of becoming someone or something is different in highschool. Many young students in highschool dont really know what they want to be when they get older. And sometimes highschool forces kids to try to find the job or jobs they want to do when they get older. I feel like as a highschool student my self, and as an 11th grader I still dont know what I want to be when I am older. I feel like for young adults like me school isnt the only thing they have in mind. For example, I have a lot of out of school activitys that take away from always just focusing on school. Also for highshcool kids relationships can be a hard. They take up all your time and they also make you angry and stressed. And that can also take away from learning and your future as I know very well myself. As young adults, Students that dont really have the ropes done in our day to day life in highschool I dont think commiting to a career in highschool is a good idea. I think schools should be teaching kids about different jobs and fields they might want to get into. But I dont think forcing kids to make there choises in highschool is something teachers should be focusing on. Instead they should be focusing on how different students learn in others ways. There are always kids that can learn and achive everything by just sitting in a class room and listening to a teacher talk. And there are the kids that cant just learn in a class room. The kids that have hard time at school becasue they have disabilities. Teaching students in highschool to be succesful is what highschool need to do. I feel like schools mainly focus on getting kids to collage and what not. But some students dont want to go to collage or even get a job durring or even after school. I feel like school should help students become successful in school but not drive them towards anything. Meaning students should feel free to do what ever they want after highschool. And it all starts with teachers asking kids what they want to do when they grow up. And a lot of students dont even know what they are going to do in the next 2 months to come. Sometimes collage is not what everyone wants. For me I want to take a gap year right out of highschool. And go play soccer somewhere. In my highschool days so far, Highschool was always been hard and its a big step from middle school. The teachers are not really on you as much as they were in middle school. So it makes u feel like u have more time for yourself. And its good in some ways becasue it teachers u how to be indepentent. But also as teachers give u more lead way students become more likely to do worse. They think its just easy to skip classes and not get in trouble. So for me everything that i have explained makes choosing a career during highschool really hard. All in all students should feel like they have the fredom to do what they want when they are at the later years of highschool with out the burden of everyone around him or her telling them they have to go to collage or that they have to choose a career when they are in highschool. I think Making studetns choose a career when they are in highschool is not something schools should be focused on. They should be focusing on having kids grow and not having them choose there careers at a young age. ",7,7,7,7,7,6,606,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Therefore if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. You can be proud of who you have become and your hard work. Once youve done everything you dreamt of achieving. Your parents would be so proud. Having a positive mindset encourages young children to treat everyone with respect.

Being active, and having a purpose are essential in being successful, also always doing something is better then doing nothing. To start off, being active can mean that youre accomplishing or trying to accomplish what youre doing. For example a boss of a company will always be trying to keep his business from loosing money, for he cant cant loose the company, so the boss will work towards saving the company. Secondly, having purpose in life, or a goal is better then dreaming about it; for instance, if you ask a successful person how they got to where they are, they wont say I dreamed for it, theyll say I worked towards my goals and didnt give, even if they thought they were gonna fail. Finally, always doing something is better then doing nothing. For example, if a student goes to school just to sit around and do nothing, he or she are wasting a opportunity to learn, and get an education towards what they want in life. Some people might say, what if you fail pressing a goal; for instance, someone is trying to make money, or getting a job and keeps failing, they learn from the mistakes and keep the right mind set, if someone can do all that theyll flourish in the future.

225,1789,310CDA45739E,"Imagination is like thinking to do diet and go to gym to get slim. Knowledge is just like running on a treadmil for 2 hours in a weak to get your weight under 79. I believe that Imagination is more Important than knowledge, because when the writer writes a book, first they Imagine the topic for their book. They dont start to write the book unless they Imagine the topic. Same as, the writers Imagine what they want to write about, they dont just start to get Information about something, asking their parents what to write, how to write. They Imagine, then they start their work. However, Imigination is also similar when you think with your sister to convince your mom to get you lots of candy. You dont ask your dad, how to convice mom to get candy. For example, the person who get the idea to Invent phone, frst he Imagine, what does phone look like, how many buttons should be there, and then he also get help with his knowledge but first he Imagine what does phone look like, how will people buy this, why should they buy my phone. Also If we use knowledge more than Imagination, the new generation will only use the cell phones to search for their homeworks. They will not Imagine to do homeworks or other things by theirself. They will just copy someones idea, which is going to demolish their brains. There will be no more good inventions, The peoples brain will stop working. Also, people will not do their work because they know they can just copy someones idea. For example, If I dont Imagine that when I will be 16, how I am going to get a job. What If I just go to Youtube and search for it, but I will not find anything and I will waste my Important time. Incase if I imagine what kind of job I want to do or where I want to do, I am pretty sure that It will not waste my time. Infact It will give me some ideas for future. In my opinion we should imagine more than using knowledge. Imagination keeps your brain work and It also keeps you active. If we dont use imagination then how our new Inventors will Introduce their creative inventions. If the stylists doesnot use their imagination then how we are going to wear brautiful clothes. If they use just knowledge and dont use their imagination, I guess they will not get that much success in their buisness. Designers use their minds to help with their clothes design. They imagine the ideas for clothes, so the people will buy more and more clothes from them. The people who use Imagination more than knowledge live longer. From now I will also use imagination as more as I can. So I will give an opinion to all of you who are reading this use your imagination than knowledge and get success in your work. I dont say that using knowledge is a waste of time, use your knowledge also but not all the time, also use your mind to imagine good, Intresting things. In conclusion Imagination is more Important than knowledge. So, I will agree with scientist Albert Einstein. I will also force you to think about this. Writers, designers , Inventors all uses their Imagination more than knowledge. Now I will also try to focus on my Imagination more than focusing to copy others information.

226,1790,BB8DBBD8C4AB,"I agree with this statement, because is hard to be yourself, in a world like this, where the people judge everything in your life, and you have to be how they want, they always are telling you what you have to do or what you not, and they not care about your opinion. A example: In my personal life is with my family, they always are telling me what I have to do, and when I do something wrong they judge me, they want to select my friends, my clothes, include my shoes, in a situation like this is difficult to be what you really what to be, and the razon is because they dont give us a chance to demostrate what we really are. Another example is: With the people of outside, we never are going to be how they want, if they saw you with a boy who use tattoo they think he is a bad boy, if you are a fat girl your ugly, if you are skinny girl your ugly too, if you use a mini skirt you are a creazy women. So we never will be fine. Everybody can judge, but we have to be strong, we have to try to demostrate what we are, or what we like to do. Razons: We can have a lot of bad situations in this life, Maybe one day we can feel bad or sad, Because we not feel good with the people who judge, maybe we are tired to feign to be another person, or maybe we can think in a negative way. A example of this could be say ""I never do something good"", "" I am not a good person"". So we need to be what we want to be, and love yourself is the most important thing, if you not love yurself no one can love you more then you, obviously we have to know what decisions we want to take, you have to feel good with yourself, with your decisions. You have to show what you are, if you feel good you will be good. All this are razons for which one is hard to be yourself, and is for that razon i agree with Mr. Ralph Waldo Emerson, cause i feel identified with what he say; I feel a winner, i feel happy with my personality, and is because i dont care what the people say, or think about me, is my life, I take my decisions. If I am a creazy women who always is imperative but i feel good with that am fine. I like to be happy, be my self. I really love me. I dont have to feign nothing. The little girl who always was doing what the people saying is in the past not in my present. I learning to be my self, so ""Yes"" I make a greatest accomplishment in my life, and is nice to be your self, now i feel relax, and satify with my decisions, I desmostrated what I am. I have a beautiful life, and my life always is with laugh, laugh, I am creazy, and I love to be creazy, my personality is unique. and i like that, so I feel very happy.",7,6,7,7,8,6,2529,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my position I think its a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect. I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students its difficult to wake up early because some students who work on Part-times, and some students dont want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones. Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations. Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort. In the other hand, I think that this program it wont help to those students who distract easy or those who dont do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who dont want to make an effort, this program it wont work to those students who dont like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school. In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life its not easy, to those students that know that if you dont work for it you wont get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",5,6,6,6,6,5,2406,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Every high schoolers"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you dont do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good GPA to college , you might as well want to stay and wait for your traditional four years. Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they dont. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her. But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit. And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging. Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early its very hard sometimes because you wouldnt know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schoolers should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

Introduction: We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesnt have enthusiams they worry about to other people. People who have enthusiams: They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy. They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment. They can help to other person who need help. They can to be the best in everything. They can to be happy to ther people who are tired or sad. People who doesnt have enthusiams: If you doesnt have enthusiams, you can not do anything. How you can help to other person if you doesnt have your own enthusiams. If your enthusiams is bad, dont be alone. If you dont have enthusiams, you doesnt wants to do anything. Do you agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success?

Reason number one students can feel a lot of pressure on them. Reason number two students still do not know what them want to be yet. Students can get a lot of pressure because students have not found out what they want to do in life. Students can get over welled so easily. Students think about it to much what they want to be when they grow up. Especially freshman they just stated school they do not need any stress when it comes to think about their career. Freshman do not what they want to be yet. They are just new kids that have just stared high school and they do not need to think about it yet.

Students still do not know what them want to be yet. It is hard to find something want you like to do in life as your career such as a young age. Students may thing they have found the one that they really want to do in life but, they change their mind and, they what want to go for the other career.

Some might says it is a good idea for students to commit a career such a young because it will benefit them in life. Here it is were I am go to prove them wrong. Students get stress so easily and they do not need any more of that. Students do not need to feel pressured and it is okay to say that they do not know what that want to be when they grow up. It is not okay to rush students as they enter high school.

240,1804,7726A1F9C660,"The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases. When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. Thats how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by. Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start. Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly dont want to do, but are forcing themselves. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so. You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you dont currently want to do. It could really be just a phase you could be having. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you werent pushing yourself to do something you didnt want to do anymore. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. I also grew to enjoying the violin more. ",7,8,7,8,6,8,1552,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
241,1805,8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people dont have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jeffersons statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something. To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker. For example, When you are given a task to complete you cant sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete. Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you cant possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I dont like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal. On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers. They say this because most high schoolers wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but cant stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably dont know whats going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future. In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",9,7,7,8,7,8,1883,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

243,1807,35C5C7E2BB5E,"Working with a group or working alone which one is more beneficial? Well to me working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons. First off you can get help from other members of your group, you dont have to do everything alone you can give each person one thing to do, and you can learn more about the topic. Now that you know my reasons of why i think being in a group is much better and more beneficial then working alone let me go more in depth about it. Working in a group is great because they can help you with the assignment. If you are struggling and one of your group members sees that you need help then they will help you. They will try and make you understand the problem so you know how to do it. They will give you different strategies and other ways to figure out the answer. For example my math teacher put me and one of my friend in a group for a assignment we were doing and i did not understand the concept. I asked my friend to help me and she sat down with me and showed me how to do it. She gave me multiple ways on how to do it and if it wasnt for her help i would still be lost and not know what to do. Another reason why working in a group is better then working alone is that each person in your group gets a specific thing to do. If each person gets a specific thing to do in the group then everything will go by much faster. You would not have to worry about doing everything by your self and putting that stress on your body you will have other members in your group that will do their part of the assignment. Last week in history class my teacher put me in a group with 3 other members. We all had a specific thing to do i had to find the citation for the information we got,Chloe found all the information on the topic, Marcus found pictures of the information, and Sean found videos to support the information that we had. We finished the project at then end of class and we also got a A as our grade. Finally you can learn more about the topic with your other group members. They could find information on your topic that you once did not know before. It can give each student new ideas and information to make the topic more clear for them and also find new discoveries. It will also help them for test and even a quiz because they just did group work and also answered questions and learned new things as well. This is my final reason on why working in a group is much better then working alone. You can learn more about the topic, you dont have to do all the work by your self, and also your other group members will be helping you if you do not understand the topic and need a little more help. These are my reasons of why i think this is much better then working alone all the time. Having a group will give you more advantages then just being by your self trying to do all the work. It is much more beneficial and i also gave valid reason of why i think being in a group is much better then working alone.

244,1808,77BD30EC277D,"Dear Principle, My name is STUDENT_NAME. I think in order to help people in community service we should take the time to help people that are in need of help. This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people. For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier. Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that wont lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. Thats why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

245,1809,2580A540719C,"Yes,I agree with the statement a positive attitude can always lead anyone to success.Positive attitude is the key to success dont lose hope even if you have lost everything. If you have a positive attitude and you work hard today or tomorrow you will become successful. If you have a positive attitude in a hard situation,you will feel like the situation is not hard and you will get over that situation. Positive attitude even helps you to maintain good heath and this will help you to get success. But if you have a negative attitude in a situation you might not get success in life. A positive attitude can will not only change your life but it can also help people close to you in achieving their goal because it will encourage them to become successful. 6 We can even take example of some successful people in the world like Steve Jobs who was forced to leave his own company but he always had a positive attitude,it doesnt matter what the situation was and 3 years later he bought his company back,not only that he had a heart disease and he was supposed to die but his will power and positiveness saved him. We can also take example of famous soccer player Christiano Ronaldo who was discriminated because of his color faced all of his hardships with a smile on his face he stayed positive in his whole life and now he is one of the greatest soccer player in the history. He just thought positve things in his life and overcame most of his hardships. In the modern world, if we even lose a small game we lose hope of winning again,but we have to change this thats not life works, everyone have hardships in their life but a smile on your face can make those hardships easy. Just think how to overcome that situation,instead of losing hope and stay positive. In the end,I would just say that everyone face hardships from a 1 year old kid to a old man but a staying positive can change the whole situation because you will be able to overcome anything. So always stay calm,take deep breadth and stay keep a positive attitude instead of getting negative.",6,6,7,8,7,6,498,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
246,1810,F2165F132C87,"Many students become participated in extracurricular activities to acquire a great educational experience. In addition, some students involved in activities that they dont have so much time to study or complete assignments. Finally, the students who participate in activities after school they dont spend so much time with their families in the afternoon. Some people argue that if students participate in activities they will focus more in what they participate; however this is the opposite because they can obtain help with their homework, and projects. Undoubtedly, sutudents involved in the activities of the school. To start, many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experience. Most importantly, a student who wanted to overcome in life wanted a good education. For example, Generic_Name is a student with a great purpose in life, and he wants to study a career. He become involved in activities like staying after school while he was in high school because he wanted to improved in the school, and be a good student. As a result, he thinks that maybe is not necessary being involve in so many activities to enrich a educational experience. With a good behavior and good grades he will enrich in his educational experience. If he show good grades in class, then probably he will be better in his education. Not only the extracurricular activities enrich the education, being involved in activities allows a student to have little time to do homework assignments as well. Additionally, some students become involved in activities like sports and they have little time to do their homework or study. A student who join in activities dont have so much time to finish their homework. Case in point, Generic_Name is a student she goes to high school, and she likes to play soccer. Generic_Name is very athletic she join in the soccer team, and she stay after school for practice everyday during the week. She is a smart student, and she likes to get good grades as well. Furthermore, when she get involved in the soccer team now she dont have so much time to complete homework assignments, and study. If she doesnt stay after school every day, then she probably will have more time to complete her homework. She thinks that it can possible to her because she shows interest in what she wants. Participate in activities allows to have little time to complete assignments, and allows to spend little time with the family as well. Lastly, students who get involved in activities after school they obtain little time with their families. However, many students likes to participate in activities of the school. In particular, Generic_Name is a student who likes to participate in the activities of the school. She likes to participate in the class activities, games, and clubs. She likes to stay after school because she is participating in one club. She just stay after school on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. When she stay those days she pass little time with her family. If she doesnt stay these days, then probably she will have more time in the afternoon with her family. Plainly, the participation that she demonstrate in the sport she improve as athletic. Some people say that involved in activities will impair some students because they can focus more in participating in activities, and not focus in their class grades. However, this idea is inaccurate. For illustration, Generic_Name is a student and he participates in a club where he obtain help with his homework, and projects. When he dont understand his homework assignments he go to the club. If he didnt participate in the club, then likely he will no receive help from the club. Therefore, participating in other activities the students can obtain help with their homework, projects, and improve their grades. In conclusion, participate in activities can be helpful to some students. Many of students prefer to participated in extracurricular activities to improve their educational experience. Secondary, some students become involved in activities, and allows students to not have so much time to finish their homework. Finally, students who participated in activities after school they have less time with their families in the evening. Conversely, a lot of students participate in extracurricular activities, they have less time to study, and they have little time with their families.

248,1812,D9BC7F4F22F0,"Well what i think about praising for a student is that it could be achievement or self-esteem. Praising could be good/bad the way how you used it. People who is a praising could be good/bad people who helps other people just like a hero, it also mean a ruler too. People who used praising could used it as a expression. Some people used praising as self-esteem to get there anger out on someone,and some peolple used it as a achievement. Some people used praising as self-esteem to ignore their pain or just get ther anger out. some people that are using praising as a achievement is good person why becasue you can do lots of things that make other people think you are a hero or a leader. It could used it in school,wrok or in general outside the word. theres lot praising in the world. Theres fighter fighter who help people with a burning house, and theres a cop who find bad guys who deserve to go to jail like crimital or robbers. And now theres us we can help people by asking if they need help if they are strugging to carry something or they have a flat tire you can help them. Just overall help people that are struggling because peope will follow your step by seeing you do it. If you see a old lady go help her bring the stuff to her car or ask her do you need any help if she say yes then help her and if she say no then shes fine but atleast you ask because some people are watching who is helping or not. Our world need more better people by help other people, we dont need any drama or bad stuff happen to our world like that. We need our world to be friendly so other people can visit us more. How you can make this world better is by help other peolpe that are struggling, care for each other, be friendly to other people make friends, and lastly be positive to other people who you see. The truth about praising is that it deopend on other people sees it and used it outside the world. If you used Praising for bad thats on you but if you used praising for good then yay for you your making this world a better place and envirment for other people and changing others people mind about our word we live in.

249,1813,F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages. First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school. second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students dont work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear. In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day.

254,1818,6E70CECCE25D,"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more. One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and dont distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they dont listening to the teacher while shes explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she dont say anything when we are using our phones. Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read. Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they dont have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and thats one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i dont have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and thats why i dont do your homework. The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases. In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.",6,7,6,6,5,7,1440,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

For exemple, to be yourself in a world you should be constantly and work hard to feel better in everything. You can try someting new like learng art, or to be volunteer, or you can do exercise.

For exemple, schools need people to help with the students. sometimes teachers, and studets have a fild treat, and schools need volunteer to help with students. For to go to the zoo, and learn about animals they can learng about the biger Giant panda, or about elephants. Also sometimes students and teaches, have a fild treat, to Washintown. to learng about the presidents, as a president Gorge Washintown.

256,1820,5241864FBC48,"My Grandma always use to say that ""working with a group is fun and all, but at the end of the day, I would have to understand what the group activity was about, but at the same time working with a group can get more work done and we help each other."" She explained to me that there isnt group work when it comes down to taking a test or quiz. Students are always sitting down and learning maybe getting up and working with a couple of classmates can help learn too. Im the one in a seat answering the questions on a test or quiz. There is no group work involved when it comes down to that. I think working alone and working as a group can both be beneficial. First when working in a group I can understand my classmates more than my teacher. I can understand more especially if a student just like me explains everything. I might not understand somethings or tend to forget, however someone in my group could know or refresh my memory by giving me notes, or vise versa. I can get a ton of work done as a group, but do I really understand what I just did. For example, say we have a group of five students, three of them are constantly talking, the other two students are the only ones in the group that are actually doing the work. The grade that the group received was a 95. If the students are quizzed on what they have just completed, the students that were talkative are most likely to get a lower grade than the two students that were actually doing the activity without getting off topic. Second when working alone there are no distractions. I would get my work done peacefully, at a rate I would like to go. I would not get as much work done as if I was in a group, but the teacher would know that its all my work. For example, say Im working with a group, we get a 93 for the whole group work. I received a quiz on what we just did and I got a 78. After that performance, the teacher gave me notes and went over the same material with me. I studied; and I took the quiz again. This time I got a 90. Therefor, this goes to show that working alone helps the teacher figure out what you need help on. Some people say that working in a group can cause fights,distractions, and poor quality work ethic. I feel like working alone is more beneficial. Everything can not be done in a group. Sometimes you have to work alone to fully grasp the subject. Working alone lets your brain process better especially at its own rate. The teacher can really see what you need help on. In conclusion, I think that both working in a group and working alone are beneficial. I think that working alone is more beneficial because everyone works and really understands the subject at a different pace. Working in a group does not show the teacher a specific persons work. Thats why I think working alone can better help yourself and is more beneficial. ",8,8,8,9,9,9,1074,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
257,1821,7CBB1B6F4E25,"Having electives classes can be a great opportunity to let students choose what they love to do and be lesss stressful. Schools, which do not have electives classes had become less popular. Students choose to study in schools that are less complicate for them. Although some say students should be required to take class in the arts actually, students classes should be electives because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit and they will have less worries. Those who believe students should be required to take class in the arts have their reasons. They believe students have to be more responsible and pass all their classes. They also think students can learn how to be good in arts. One reason, why class in atrs should be electives is because students can use the free time more helpful for their benifit. For example, my friend Generic_Name he only had to take Algebra 2, English 12, U.S Goverment, and Chemistry to graduate this year. However, he had to take one class in the arts that was required to graduete. But, Generic_Name did not have more space during that day, and the other day of school Generic_Name had to work to help his mother. If Generic_Name did not have to take the class in arts. He will be able to graduate this year. In addition, he will not waste his time in one class that maybe will not be interesting for him. Also, he will be able to help his mother about taking care of his litter bother. When she was working, so his mother did not have to work less hours. Another reason, why classes in school shoud be electives is because students will have less worries. For instance, my friend Generic_Name. One day she had to study for her History ESOL. As well as, she had to make a big and beautiful draw for her class in art. Generic_Name took almost all the night making the draw ,so she did not have time to study and she fall the ESOL. If Generic_Name did not have to make the draw for her art class. She will study for the ESOL, and she will get enough sleep. Generic_Name will be able to think and pass her test. And she will have more time to study. Sometimes taking a lot of classes is not a good idea for students bacuse it is to hard for them to concentrate. To conclude, I believe that class in arts should be alectives becuase students will be more confident in doing what they love to do. Also respecting students opinions can be a great opportunity to demostrate them that school cares about what they feel. For those reasons I think class in arts should not be required. One is that students will use the free time more helpful for their benifit. Another one is that students will have less worries. School have to see what their students need to make them capable and sucessful. ",7,7,8,8,7,6,1643,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
258,1822,BB240E6FF61F,"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the peoples actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness. Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parents influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship. However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship. Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.

259,1823,F772343CC7A7,Do you wounder why kindness impact on people think in your mind how kindness effect peoples lives. The first reason is when someone show their kindness to much and they get annoyed. The second reason is when they show kindness back they will angry at you because you got annoyed bye theirs. The third reason is some people just dont like small people because they believe they give you bad luck. My forth reason is an ex:Like say someone like lets say...Generic_Name gives you a hug but lets say the player decides to kill Generic_Name then Generic_Name his brother comes and shields him then Generic_Name gets his revenge bye judging you by teaching you to be nice. My last reasons] is also a ex:Then you spare/give him respect Generic_Name is happy and goes home you can chose to kill the king or go to his house and live with him and ask him to teach you the acts of kindness. The other ways people can show kindness is fighting their demons. And fighting bullies from their past in their head or in the real world. Sometimes gas stations get rob and the police have to chase them down and sometimes you can help them. Some other ways people and kids can help they can show kindness to the ocean bye getting trash in the water. Another why people can show kindness is helping the community pick up trash on the ground. People across the world their are so much kind people out their they can help you with anything. Like clean up your yard and the shed and the playground and the trampling and the outside of the house. And they need kindness to so we help them to in needed or in trouble. I had a old friend name umm... i forget so lets call her Generic_Name she had a lot of problems like trying to kill her self or cut her self or Evan hang her self but i was all ways there for her but on day she went missing and i never saw her again we had good times together but she was there for me to like when we were kids she wood protect me from bullies and demons i dont know how she known about demons when we were in 3 grade i did not care. Sometimes i wounder is she here watching me has a ghost i would be happy but creep out at the same time.

260,1824,ACE1BE41A8E0,"One of the most famous quote by Thomas Jefferson is, "" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if its little it can be done but may take time. I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you dont practice everyday then you wont get better at soccer. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism. If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. I always believed that i can do a lot if im doing something all the time. When i was little i use to make Legos i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. My mom always told if im building them everyday i could get done fast. I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast. If you dont practice everyday then yo wont get better at soccer. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When you dont do that you wont get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasnt practicing everyday so i didt get any better. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasnt training everyday so i didnt get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. Most people dont make their dreams because they dont do the little things that matter everyday. There is a lot that need to done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. Police officer shooting black men that didnt do anything. That causes people that have been killed familys pain. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because its not fair to the people who died familys. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday. As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. Only when we do something you accomplish more. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe.

261,1825,F9111CF0A009,"one topic that is that is frequently debate today is four-day school week. Some people think is better for students, so they can have three days free to do their homework and have a par time job. I believe that students dont need four-day school and extend the school day two hours, because some students cant work after school or do our homework, students cant have time for our families in afternoon. and students cant have three days off and after come and they will not remember what they learn last class. one reason why is students cant work after school or do their homework because students will come tire after ten hours on school. student will come late and they will come just to have a dinner and sleep. students will come so late that they will not be able to do their homework on time do to no time for them. students need five day to do what they normally do they will have time for homework, have a dinner, and sleep well everyday. and the next they they can come ready to learn more and enjoy the school hours. another reason why is that students will not have time for their families. students having ten hours in the school come tires and they dont want to talk not event with their families. Some students come straight to the bed and their families dont have time to talk to them or give an advice. Some families have the tradition to go out like five or six at clock but students will not be able to go out with families and friends. thats why students need the normal days to study they have a routine that they follow. The final reason why is that students cant take three days off and after come they will not remember what they learn last class. Some teachers choose that Monday is a really good day to start with a test or quiz students will not remember what they learn after three days with out study. Sometimes students are learning a topic really important and they understand but when they come after three days off they will not remember anything. If students will have three days off they will work these days and when they come back to school after three days of they will not be able to remember everything they will forget. students need the five days to study how suppose to be. as you have read four-day school is not good idea because students will not have time to study do their homework and enjoy with their families. If students have four days school, ten hours at day students will be tire and they will not here the same routine that they use to have. Only when students have the normal school days they will have time to learn more and focus more. and have the best time as possible with family.

262,1826,BEC3906A1122,"Do you think that teenagers should be home by 10 p. m. or not? In this computer, I will argue that teenagers should have a curfew and be home by 10 p. m. to keep them safe and away from trouble. The streets will do you know good, so if teenagers get curfew that will be keep them away from the streets and be home safe with their family and friends. I can relate to this prompt, because Im a teenager and I know how it feels like not having a curfew to save you from getting in to trouble thats why I will argue that its important to have a curfew. I think that if teenagers have curfews it will keep them away from trouble like I have already said. Not having a curfew is like you sending your kids to go die or giving them away to the streets and telling them they can do whatever they want and they will not get in trouble. Curfew will help a lot if the government make it a law that teenagers should be home by 10 p. m. if they are home their will be no getting hurt or being in trouble will the law or your parents. Im a teenagers myself and I would love to keep a curfew that will keep me away from trouble and other bad creams that will get me in trouble will the law or keep me away from my family. No one loves getting in trouble,but if they are out last will other people they call friends that will get them in more trouble, because not all friends are friends when it comes to the streets; or going to jail. I know for sure that if we teenagers have a curfew their will be know one dying, getting hurt, or getting in trouble with the law which means going to jail not all the time, but their are lots of teenagers who go to jail just, because they dont have curfews. I know Im a child and I dont know much about the law, but I rather get a curfew than go to jail or get in trouble with the law and my family just for staying out last at night. Teenagers will be safe if they have curfews they will not be in streets or get their parents worried about where they are or what theyre doing. Safety is the number one thing in the United States and any other country. The curfew will help them, because if they said 10 p. m. they have to be inside than theyre inside, because no one can get to them where theyre a safe place like there homes. They will be safe they will not get in to fights with people they dont know all, because of they were out side all night. Theyre too young to be outside last at night they need to sleep; because I know some teenagers go out on schools and that can ready affect them, because if you dont get enjoy sleep at night you will not be able to do your work in class and when you are sleeping you will miss out on what the teacher is talking about and when it comes to test you fail it all, because you didnt go sleep and stay outside with your friends all night. Teenagers need to be where theyre safe, so that nothing will happened to them and their parents will not worry, because there are lots of creams out there you dont want your kids to be outside at night with all the crazy thats going on out there its scary and I know no parents wants to see there kids get hurt, because they didnt have a curfew and they dont know when to come home. Curfew is there to help and keep us safe and the government need to make that law I really know that if they have curfew time hours how country will be a better place and no one will feel scared to go outside or stay there for long. Curfew will make you have a better future it might sound crazy, but if we have curfews now as teenagers in the future when we get a job it will be easy for us, because we are already use to getting home quick, so that will not be a problem for us at work. The curfew will be a big help to us in the future like I said going to work early will not be a problem, because no office want a person that comes to work last. So, giving us a curfew at this age will help us a lot in the future. Some people say that having a curfew is a bad and interfere in young peoples lives, but theyre wrong, because it keeps them away from trouble, safe, and they will have a better future if we have the curfew. Thats why in the future I would love to see the government make a law about that to keep us safe and keep us away from trouble, so i would give an arm to see that the government make that law I dont know how, but i know that ""God"" will make that happened in the future.",6,8,8,7,7,7,2566,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 6"
263,1827,7ABD75EA7CBC,"Imagine going to school everyday to learn and experience new things, when it comes to lunch, students are ready to eat and enjoy there favorite food with others but the principal made an announcement about changing the lunch system by getting rid of junk foods to healthy foods. Students favorite food being replaced by healthy food will be a nightmare to them. No more pizza, burgers, spaghetti, etc, will be all gone and will cause a problem. Removing students favorite food to healtheir ones will be a bad idea. Students will dislike eating healthy food, and students will feel hunger and lose concentration in class. Firstly, Some students will dislike some healthy food that they dont enjoy. For example, Generic_Name goes to lunch and sees the only food aviliable is a salad. He never ate salad before but sees a lot of vegetables including lettuce, tomatos, onions, etc. He feels disgusted by the food he was serve and rather starve. What I mean is that students being served to vegetables which they wont take a bite of, wont make them eat because they dont enjoy eating vegetables that was served to them and might get student to not eat but starve which will be bad to there body. Additionally, the students will be in bad shape during class time. They will feel hungry, sick, or possibly pass out. For example, Generic_Name came back to class from lunch and he didnt eat anything because of the food that was serve. While doing class work, Generic_Name doesnt feel well and his stomach starts to growl because he didnt eat anything. He will lose focus and will start begging for food. What I mean by that is students in class will feel hungry and there stomach will soon to growl and will lose focus on class instructions. The principal should not make these changes and keep the system of lunch the same because there body will be in good shape and will gain energy through out the day. Some people will disagree my reasoning and opinion on changing the school food system to healthier ones is a bad idea. They will say say its a good idea because they will consume healthy foods that will make students grow stronger, will have a healthy diet, and be more energized within there life. That may be true but thats not the case because student are comfortable on what they eat and what suits them will suit there future lifestyle.

The support from people is the best way to make a person feel better. Also students should have someone who can helps out or making this person feel better, comfortable, giving ideas or finding many different ways to support him to keep going and helping to never give up.

267,1831,89506A98AC2B,"People say, having a positive attitude is the key to a success in life. I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things. You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true. It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt. People wont be able to brake you down that easily. So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life. When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it. Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"". Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action. Sometimes your words reflect your actions. This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life. Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"". Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"". Having faith makes you believe in yourself When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action. But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible. This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other. So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude. Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too. If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad. The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours. For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"". Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try. So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",7,6,6,6,6,5,1822,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I belive, that failure is an important element that plays in the persuit of success, because the failure lead to succes, failure is unavoidable, learn from your mistakes, and the failures often leads to problems. One reason is the success that consist of going from failure to failre without loss the enthusiasm. Failure is unavaidable, the path of success is not a straight on. Every people have to fails sometimes in the life, but that is part of the life. For example sometimes, invest money in some bussiness, but we dont know if go to win a lot money, or lost all the money or just one part of money. If for some reason we fails, doesnt matter, we need to try again, maybe that would be the success to have your company owner. Never say not, before try it. Another reason, is to learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistakes at least you know, not to do it again. A failure might put end thing idea or opportunity, but lead you others. If you ready failure and you know what was the mistakes try to find a solution, and not come back with the same ideas, you need to learn for each mistakes. For example, if I say something wrong, like English word, if somebody heard me and corrigir me, I try to not say that word again. One more reason, failure often leads to problem, we need to solve our problems and getting throught difficul times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures you will to be prepared and have most experienced in the future. If you know that to fails before, so you are somebody with most experience in the life, you know that if you have a important roll in your work, that is why you to fails in some time, but you need always to continue ahead. Everyone have differents kind of problems, but each problem have solution. If for find solution is possible that we go to fails, just doing that, we need to solve each problem without doesnt matter what come ahead we always want the success. In conclusion, failure can change who you are, and what path youre on the life. To fails in our life is something that cannot to avoid, but we not wanted to be a failure always, we want to change and have success. Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success. We need to pass for differents path and in each one, we go to learn new things.

272,1836,A87C80DEAB08,"People use to say that working make better life. In now days people who are self-reliance define as they need people to follow their instincts or ideas and their is also people who are usually follow their own ideas. Both of them are working ways that are preferred to people, But I think that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters, Because it will make their life easier and help people who are having troubles in their life. There are a lot of thing that we cloud talk about people asking help from expert,But I got two of the story that I want to talk about and made peoples life easier. The first example is a true story that happened to me when I was young. It was a summer in 2010, I was in a summer camp for basketball at Generic_City, It was the first practices day and I was so happy, Because I could finally start to have real training for basketball. At that time I was in a private school that have no sports, So the only way that I cloud play sport is going to camp in summer time. Well that day at middle of the practice I hurt my ankle because of my teammate so I had to stay in hospital. In hospital I thought that I will not able to play sport anymore so I was really upset about it, When I was thinking about that, My father told me that life is easy and hard some time and life will never follow the step that people go, so they have to be stronger to be able to control their own life so they will not follow the step that other people went, After my father told me that I start to realize that life aint easy so I have to be way more stronger than before so I could be better me in future and it happened now, So that is the reason that I think with others help peoples life will be way easier than before. The second example is a story that my mother told me when I was a child. It is a story about a young man trying to make a hammer. It was a winter in long time ago, there was a young man that live in a really old house, At one day he was trying to make a hammer so that will help him to make a new house. So he traveled a lot of place to find a perfect iron for that hammer, In the way to find perfect iron he found so many iron thats not perfect in his eyes. But in one day he found a old man that are making a hammer, when young man came close to old man he found out that is the perfect iron that his finding all day long so he asked old man how did he found the iron, After old man heard what he said he laughed and said"" young man in this world nothing is perfect if you trying to make a hammer like me you have to make everything equally, And nothing is perfect on lest you treat them perfect."" After old man told everything to young man he realized that the iron that he think is not perfect is perfect if he treated is nicely and in the end he made a normal hammer that could really help him in the future. After my mother told me this story I realized that with older help you will know a lot of things that you never knew before, And this is the second reason that I think that with experts help your life will be better and you will learn a lot of lifes matter than before. Some people often think that they will decide everything by their self, And there are some people are seek guidance from experts and authorities. But I think that people should ask form expert and authorities help, Because it will make peoples life easier and help people who are having trouble in there life.

I think that is a good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because in the four years that they are in high school they can get prepare in the career they want. By the time the students enter to college it will be much easier for them because they have already decided what career should be better for them. There are four year in high school, students can use those years to star to learn a little bit in the career they chose. For example, I had one friend that he wanted to be a scientist, so when he was in high school he get prepared to a scientist, he started to look what he need be a scientist, he looked how many years he had to go to college, he found that science has a lot of math problems that he did not know and he started to learn math. The four years in high school can help you to get prepare in your the career you want. Another reason why students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school is that when go to college it will be much easier for them. If the students identify a career by that time, in college they can only focus in the career they chose. There are many students that go to college and they have not already decided what career should be better for them, and in many cases there are students that are out of college and still thinking what to do with their life. Thats why it is important for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school or at least when they are still in high school. In my opinion its good idea that students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school, because if they could identify a career that they might think they would like, that could be a lot of helpful, because by the time they go to college they dont get stress because they dont have much time to decide what career could be better for them.

Sports is what most of people do play a sport but we always get frustrated when the opposite team scores a point so we try our hardest to score back the point. School is what a lot of humans struggle on its our work sheets and test but every question wrong we get it makes our brain smarter so do our best and not pick the wrong answer. Family is people we love and hang out with all the time but not very often we get into problems but every time we have a problem we just have to find a solution to do our best. This is why I agree what Duke Ellington said about a problem is a chance to do your best. Sports is fun activity we can all do but most of the people do or watch but a lot of the player or fans.

The team and I fixed the problem an tried our best trying to win back again and we did win. My brother plays basketball he used to be terrible at playing basketball he missed every shot but fixed the problem by practing more and tried his best. Most of the sports have a problem but they fix it. School is a place where we make friend learn new subjects. For some people in school they struggle a lot on worksheets, test and quizzes. I used to struggle on test and quizzes but when i got the test or quiz back i studied on the questions i got wrong. So when next time I took the test i would get those questions right. So the problem i got wrong i tried my best to remember it so i would not forget it when i have the same questions on the test Family are people we love and hang out with but sometimes we have problems with each other.

One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school. Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out. Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change. Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision.

The fourth year of high school gives them more time to learn. It also gives them more time to explore different careers they might want to do. Students might be stressed out too much. It is better to take your time then to rush your career. Students who go the last year of high school have more time to learn more. They can take more classes than those who would graduate early. The classes will be easier because they will be learning at their grade level, not a grade level above. They also wont have as much homework and classwork to do at a time. The students will have more career choices to choose from. If they have more time they will be able to have electives that can help them choose their career. For example there is a nursing class, carpentry class, electricity class, welding class, and many more that can help them get started. If they cant take electives then they wont have experiences that may help them. Lots of work on a students can cause them to be stressed out. Some students already get stressed by the amount of work they get in regular classes. Imagine all the stress they get when they are taking more classes at a time. They can get stressed by all the homework and classwork they get from all their classes. They might also have a job they have to get to save money for their college supplies like textbooks.

284,1848,5ADD410B9783,"A student does not need to be success to be praised, an achievement doesnt always necessary to have a self-esteeming come from effort failure and motivation, First, success is not the only thing that can make a student be praise. It is their effort whats matters even though a student did not do well on hes work, but a least he tried to do it, may be he is good at it, but he is have been a hard time on his life at that time, if a teacher or someone said good job you did it well i am proud of you. He is gonna be happy of that someone understand him at his bad time, and support him. Second, failure is where a student achieve, learn, and gained experience, e never going to achieve at something without fail. Example, my on experience i have been seem achieve, and things that i did not succeed on it, in my life i had failed many school test or not get the score what i want to me it a fail, but to others it not, i always get mad at myself if i do not succeed at any tiny gold. When my teachers or someone tells me something nice, Good or they are proud at my work i felt so my proud of myself i am so proud that i have peoples who can understand me and support me. One day a teacher said "" im proud to have as my student and to be your teacher you had showed me that no matter what where you came from you can achieve anything you want, also in how hard you have worked maybe your work is no that good, but i had seeing you work harder keep being like this do not gave up on your dream or what you are doing "" she praised me with all her words made me cried , and to keep going believe in myself that i can do everything. Third motivation and self- confident, is what makes the difference, and changes a student life. being confident on what we are doing on our life or working on something even if we dont give our best at least we tried it, sometimes we achieve in something and we dont learned any new thing because we already know hoe it is done it, if a person praise someone it motivates them to keep going and and not give up on their dreams even if its hard and impossible self-esteem makes a person fight back. Finally, self-esteemed wont be always be for achievement, an self-esteem will be always on a student who are willing to do what is hard not the easy thing even though, they dont succeed and or achieve they know who they are and what they are able to do, lowers standard is better then nothing. some people may think achievement are required to praise while others think that is not, and for this reasons it doesnt be necessary to be success or achieve a gold to be praised by someone.

286,1850,9F9C42BD3B7A,"We live in a world where each and everyone of us, will always need someone or others to rely on. In this world not everyone is born complete. However being yourself is always good, but you can also change yourself if you feel the need to. But if someone else were to change you then that would be very bad, because they could be either delusional or emotionally negative of certain things in life. When your being yourself on my opinion it means you shouldnt have others change the way you are but its up to how you feel about yourself. I strongly disagree Emersons statement on how individuality is a good thing, and i have various reasons or examples on this statement. I have many important people like my mom,dad,sister, and very close friends who are also like family to me. Having other people is vital because you get through life more easily, and able to change yourself as you live on. But if you got rid of all of that then you would probably live a lonely life in deep and total solitude. Having other people isnt trivial, you have to have faith in one another to get through life. There was this one time where i was about twelve to fourteen years old, i would always struggle with my grades in the beginning of the school year, and have a strong sense of unease everyday i go to school because i always felt like wouldnt be able to provoke my self to do better in school and get better at socializing. I was only caring for myself most of the time, and when i get back home i would feel depressed and repugnant. But that all changed later when i realized i needed to have others to help me. As time went on i was able to change myself by others around me. The world isnt changing you you are changing yourself by just living a life with others around you, and you wouldnt notice that you changed either, but that is a good thing because now you know that if your able to change then anyone should be able to. The last thing that is bad when you dont have anyone else with you, is that it can be really boring and not fun at all. When your all alone in your life, you wont have anyone to socialize with you, and keep you company. But when you have a lot of friends and get to know other people, you can have an experience with them and its what makes life really entertaining. When your with your friends you get to have lots of fun, like play games together, socialize, travel together, and get to have more and more experiences with each other and maybe learn more lessons in life. Theres a lot of people who think that we live in a society where no one cares about you and doesnt want to help you at all. but thats not true because it isnt there fault, because when you have others with you, it can have an effect positively and negatively. And people who are negative all the time can provoke others to be a bad person, which is why they end up all lonely because they fear of others or hate others because they think no one cares about them. But thats not true because all it takes is to change yourself, by having others in your life, or asking for help. In conclusion individuality can be pretty awful and lead others to a path that is bad. Having others in your life is necessary because we can lift each other up, no one is worthless. Leaving someone on there own can be pretty sad, helping them is what makes you a better person and gives you a better and easy life. But as i said dont let anyone change who you are, being yourself is good but being alone simultaneously can be a bad thing. You are the protagonist of your own life, your life is your own.",8,8,9,9,9,9,2134,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
287,1851,B3AAF502DFFE,"In this generation people use Technology for their needs and wants. If their was no Technology than I would not be able to take my writing SOL which I am taking it right now. In my opinion I believe that the limitation of human contact due to the use of Technology had positive effects on peoples lives. People use Technology to complete many tasks through out their lives. If their was no Technology their would not be any improvement in our lives neither country. people can contact their family with video calls to see their families that they havent seen each other for years. It has been 7 years that I am living in United States of America and I cant go back to my country for various reasons, but I have been in contact with my family everyday, which makes me really happy, and feel good about it. Nowadays everyone need Technology for everything. My friend father is an engineer, and all his work is with computer, and Technology. If their was no Technology he wouldnt be able to complete his task or learn new things neither earn money. Technology saves Millions of people lives in many ways. Many people do not have money to take tutorials for their kids, but they can use YouTube and Google which let them learn in a better way, and without paying any money. In fact even though if you had money you could save your money and use Technology/ Internet for learning. My parents never took me to any tutorials not because they didnt have money but because they wanted me to be independent and use Internet to learn more. Technology had helped me a lot, and will be helping me and millions of people in this world. I think in this Generation If their was no Technology people would not improve or even learn anything. I have learned from Internet that you can read books online instead of going and buying. Technology has let people gain education and experiences through our lives. Their are thousands of disabilities in this world which they cant go and work, but they use Internet to sale some stuff so they can earn money. My cousin is a specialist and he was born with not having one of his leg. He was so depressed and didnt have any confident that one day he could work and earn money, but with the help of Internet I have thought him to buy some clothes and other stuff and put it online so people can see and buy it. Technology has lots of benefits that we humans are so lucky of being able of using it which some people cant, because of various reasons. It has been 3 years that we have opened our own clothing business in Unites States of America, and as we all know its really hard competing with clothing stores here in USA, but from the time we started putting our clothes in websites and becoming popular day by day we are making lots of profits which makes us really happy. Technology has a positive effects in our lives which a lot of people agree with my opinion. I agree with that, that Technology also had a negative effects in our lives , but also that depends on the person itself which decides how to use Technology. Most of my friends make fake accounts on Instagram and Facebook to bully people which a lot of people die from being bullied. Technology has a lot of advantages and disadvantages that we can use form it. Some peoples use Internet for watching bad videos, making fake accounts and put putting fake news on websites and hacking people through social media which are really bad, but their are only 5% that they do those things, and not everyone which we should think of the other 95% of using Technology for their needs, and the benefits of gaining lots of education. In my perspective I believe that the use of Technology has positive effects on people lives, because we human are earning money out of Technology, learning new things, and gaining experiences in our lives with the help of of Technology. I think their should be a way of blocking the bad websites and making securities for people making fake accounts and for people that bully others to stop it. In my opinion we should think about the benefits of Technology than the negatives because. If their was no Technology our lives would never improve and we would not be able to learn new things. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contacts with each other. My dad has been in Generic_City for 30 years and his job is sailing Fabrics and all his customers are from Generic_City, Generic_City ,and Generic_City which they have never been in Generic_City. They have founded our sites through online, and buy from us. My dad has never seen most of his customers in real lives they only have been in contact. We should look at Technology from a good point of view. In General we have variety of reasons that we could use technology of our tasks to be completed. Technology could be good and bad in both ways which we human should decide of how to use it either of our needs or for negative things. I believe that technology has had positive effects on people lives.",7,7,7,8,5,7,2419,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
288,1852,ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students. People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids dont learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids. Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it . Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition. First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. Thats why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable. Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. Thats why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too. Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and its hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them thats why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless. in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it. When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isnt going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the dont listen to the rest of the people.",6,5,7,5,5,6,2325,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Today, many people living in U.S. and people has many attitude, and some peoples has good attitude that key to success in life, others has not good attitude. Although, some people think that attitude is not important to the life because of it is dependents on how you work harder, one might think that positive attitude is the key to success in life because you do not stuck in same problem, you could become strong, you could have many supporters. First, you do not stuck in same problem. If you have problems about your job or in your life, and you do not know how to fix your problems, but If you have positive attitude you could think positive way to your problem, and do not need spend the so much time for your problems.

So, I really enjoyed every game and I did make it so many score in the game. Second, you could become strong. If you did big mistake in your job or in relationship, of cause at the first you will be sad, but you could change to positive way quickly so you will work harder and you could fix mistake. Two years ago I was dating with boy that he goes to same school, but we did not work out not longer. I was so d and I was cried every day, but my mom told me that ""you will be fine, glow up and become strong then make him jealous"". So, realized that stay in sad mood everyday is not good for me, and I changed to think positive way and I focused more about myself, I did my makeup, I bought new cute clothes. And my ex boyfriends asked me to If you want mo to back together, but I said no because I knew he will hurts me again, but I was so happy that I could make his jealous and I told myself that I win then at the same time felt strong. Third, you could have many supporters. If you have negative attitude and you always sad then you always say no or I can not do it other people might start thinking about you that not fun person because If someone trying to cheer you up but you keep saying no, it will make triers uncomfortable. No one do not want to spend the time with negative person. If you have positive attitude people think about you that nice, and fun person so for example, your boss or your teachers and friends, they will support you and your life become grateful. In conclusion, having a positive attitude is the key to success by you do not have to waist the time small problems, you could become strong about anything, you could enjoy your life, and you could get many supporters that support your life and so important to success in life.

290,1854,EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to "" The Washington Post, "" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important. The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Names goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 oclock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job. The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in Villages Company . He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Villages Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Villages Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs. In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",7,7,8,8,5,7,3518,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
291,1855,13AB4CC7F80F,"I like to play my instrument,because I like the relaxing songs we play. And my older brother use to play the violin so thats two reason why i started to like instruments so much. And I been trying to learn how to play the violin for a while now. I also learn how to play old to joy which is a amazing song in my opinoin. My new music teacher this new year has very been pushing us to our limit which is great because he could help us on the parts we dont know how to play yet. Moon night is a old music sheet that we still play. The music notes on it are really hard to play, LIke on line number four and ten. It seems like im been getting better in just a short amount of time which my teacher and brother are very proud about. If i do master the violin im gonna try the paino next and my reason for that is just to play it on a rainy down and I know which song to play and its called thank you by dido, its such a lovely song to play when its raining outside. Also i heard a song called happier which I been trying to play this week. I wonder what kind of jobs i can get if I keep going down this path, hopefully its a good paying job. Instruments are good educational activitys becasue it makes people to try over and over again until they get it right which is very hopefull ti those who want to keep trying. My brother haves been takeing his time teaching me how to play the violin because he nocites that i been playing it lot or he had nothing else to do. The good thing about instruments it teaches you that things take time and partices to learn just like most things in the world which is really hopefull. And ever instrument teaches you something a little different from one another which I find it amazing that each instrument has new to explore on it. Also in the world of music you can your music you just need to take your time with it. When you do that song can become the next big thing. Plus you can your feelings into the song and playing from the heart is what music is all about. Playing from the heart can be a little odd to most people, and most people are shy about it as well. And stundents can help each other parts of the music sheet so the teach wont have to waste his time ever stundent who dosent know a part. Learning how to play a instrument it enjoyable and a new to learn something new, Which every teacher wants from their stundents correct? Also buying music sheets is also a way to go out to world and see whats going on. Which music your mind is your only limit, well thats what my music teacher saids anyway. Plus you might go into a collage for free if your very good at playing your instrument. Which is really amazing that could happen. And i think theres clubs for playing imstruments so stundents can learn which each other with things that they dont know yet which could be a huge help for them and maybe later on as well. Also if they have someone in thier famliy knows how to play a instrument they can teach them as well, and maybe even more.",6,5,8,7,6,6,272,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

293,1857,78EA0C3715FE,"In most cases student are committed to a career at a young age by school or their parents to guide them early. This could be a benefit for them, since they are young and have the capacity to learn faster, also if they are in high school it would be good for them to be guided at a young age to help them on a career they would like to take, and when they go to college,they dont find the stuff they are going to see complicated, and they are somewhat prepare and have an idea of what they are going to learn if they choose to go to college. I think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because it helps students prepare their mentality, knowledge, and give them an idea of what they are going to see, and focus on the career they want to choose. Most of the time students do not want to commit to a career at a young age because they are either so stressed out from school and they feel like they cannot decide what career they want to take or because they feel like it is not really going to help them much on what they choose. Some students dont know or cant decide what career they want to take, and that is not okay because they most know by the time they are at least in 11th grade, so school can give them the appropriate classes to prepare them for that career, and those classes to help them when they go to college. In fact, not going prepare to college it can be complicated to students and probably stressful since they have no idea what so ever of what they are going to see or learn. For example, when you know what career you want to take since the beginning of high school and you are focus on that career, and you take the classes that will help you be prepare for that career, when you go to college you have an idea, and you are not going to be as stress as other students who didnt want to take advantage of that. I would personally take the chance so I can be prepared for college, I think if I take classes that will help me be prepared it would obviously be good for me. I already know what career I want to take and the classes that are recommended for that specific career, and it is actually good because I can learn more about that career, I know that I am capable for the career I want and that it will not be hard for me since I always liked what I want to do which is about computers, and technology related. My parents also recommend me to commit to my career at young age so I can learn and practice my skills. Some students dont have the support of their parents like I do and they just decide to finish high school and be done which is not really good if they want to get a job that will give them a lot of money, and most of the jobs requires you to have a degree of some sort or specific for that job. There are jobs that dont ask for anything just the high school diploma, but those jobs dont really pay that much, and they are kind of heavy, not all of them but most of them. Some jobs like construction, and plumber dont require that you need to have a college degree just the high school diploma, and this jobs also pay really good, but they are really tiring and heavy, mostly construction that you have to be outside in that hot temperature or cold. If you compare this jobs with like a being a doctor, dentists, or technician; this jobs requires you to have a college degree, and you have to go to college for either 2,3,4 or 5 years so you can get the degree of any of this careers, and they pay you a lot and it is not heavy and you dont expose yourself to hot or cold temperatures, and that is a benefit for you if you want to have a really sotf or calm job. Basically if you know what career you want to take, and you prepare yourself like taking all your classes, and what you need, you should be good for the most part. Not all the time going to college to get a degree so you can get a job is the only way to get money or make a living out of it. For example, you can be a singer, and if your music is loved by most of the people you can success and make money out of it by selling albums or promoting your songs to different platform in internet. Playing sports like soccer, basketball, tennis, or baseball can give you a chance to make money, for example, you can have a career out of that, but you most good for big teams to pick you up and pay you which payment is a lot if you make it to the big teams. This doesnt always work for everyone only for the talented ones that were meant to be good at each of the careers. For example, I like to play soccer, but I am not good enough to make a career out of it, so I decided to finish my studies, follow my career, and get the job that I would like. Some students finish high school and then they decide to do this type of careers which sometimes work for few of them, they reached their goals and sometimes they dont even finish high school, but if they cant accomplish this, then they have all they need which is their diploma or they can continue with their studies to get the job they would like to have. In conclusion, is a good thing that students commit to a career early so they can be prepared for the future this will also help them develop their capacity when they go to college where things will get a little bit hard for them. Most of the students do this and they success in their careers, I would to the same because I know high school will help me get prepare for college, and I dont have to feel the pressure of not knowing anything all, I already have a little bit of understanding and knowledge.",9,8,7,8,7,8,1584,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
294,1858,890FAF6F82FC,I agree with this statement because its impossible to change this impressions. Some people have physical problem its impossible to change. Lots of people have mental problem with getting mad. If somebody have mental problem maybe they fight with someone. They have to go to hospital to check up. If they take some medicine maybe they get better. When they have physical problem they yelling on the street and running and lots of people scared from them. They family have to keep them at home. If they didnt safe at home. There family can take them to lunatic asylum because they cant stay at home they go out and did something to the people. People can call to Police and maybe police arrest them then they get trouble from police. There parent should protect them from this disaster. If they want to go out there parent go with them because its safety for them. For parent this condition is distress. This condition of doing something badly for parent. If this kind of condition they have they do care for children. They have frustration about children because this condition is very badly. They cant go outside they stay all the time at home. If parent go out maybe child go outside and again he/she did something badly in public. If they want to walk outside by them self they cant because they have to go with parent. Some parent they take them children into park they want to play but reason is there is lots of kids playing. If he/she did something to kids is very bad situation.

296,1860,48F7FCAD8B23,"Will has you can see getting advice from others is not a bad idea. I think getting advice from others has a great point of view and a bad point of view by the way someone can look at. When you are trying to get advice from someone remember to ask more then one person for advice. One of my reasons is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. My other reason is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. My last reason is asking people for advice can hurt its not always going to make you happy. My first statement is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. Most of the people in this world have different point of view for each person on the way they see them or maybe by the way they you act and look. Asking only one people is not a good idea because someone might just be looking at you how you look and how you dress. They might just say bad things to you because they thing your not worth nothing and they are the only ones that actually are worth something in this world. People in this time dont gave good advice to people because all they want to do is make people look bad in front of others. My second statement is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. Will in my point of view asking people for advice is not a great idea because some people might just till you lies when you are asking for advice. Sometimes people just tell you lies because they know that you need help but all they are going to do is make you look bad. They are some people that all they want you is to suffer just because they are having problems at home. Getting advice form one person is not a good idea because you might not know if they hate you or that you might have done something that hurt them and you didnt know and you asked them for advice they would gave you bad advice just for what you did to them. My last statement is that asking people that you thing that will tell you the truth no matter if it hurts or not is not a bad idea. They are some people that would tell you the truth even if its going to hurt a lot but the only thing they want for you is too be happy. Asking people older then you is a great idea like your family because maybe they have been though a lot maybe they might even hate you or something else but they would never lie to you because you are there children they care about you. Getting advice is not bad it also can depend on the way you decide to take it if you take it as a good or bad way because most of the people that are always there in your bad a good moment always want the best thing for you because they love you. In conclusion, asking for advice sometimes and talking to others more advice can help you make good choice but at the same times bad choice it all depend on you if you want to be a great or bad person. Everyone has there point of view to take the advice that someone gives you in a good or bad way. Mostly the people that love you are going to tell you the truth even though if it hurt because they know that later or after you are going to find out the truth. In this world you should take most of the advice that other people gave you because they have already been thought a lot but they dont want you to through the same thing because they actually want you to be someone if life even if they couldnt be someone in life. The advice that someone gives you is not bad it to help you see how hard they work because they didnt take the advice that they gave you are they didnt get the chance like you have so if someone gives you a great advice you should be grateful.",6,6,7,6,4,4,954,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Even on the weekend a midnight curfew is more than enough time to enjoy themselves. It is very dangerous at night, and anybody that is out after midnight increases their chances of doing wrong or becoming a victim. Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them. Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole. Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do. If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible. Going out after midnight is not being responsible. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night. I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good. A curfew would also address this situation and help them succeed in school. Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen. Parents need to show their children part of maturing is doing the right thing. Being mature is understanding that you do not need to be outside late at night. Maturity helps us understand that in life we can not always do whatever we want. I have friend that complain about not being able to stay out late, but as they mature they will understand that a curfew really helped keep them safe. Going outside after midnight is very dangerous. Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night. There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night. Teenagers need to value their safety, and know that whatever they can not do before midnight does not need to done. Curfews can help with this mindset and keep teenagers safe. To reiterate, society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew is crucial part in making this happen. Parents should support being more strict with their childrens curfew. Midnight is more than enough time for teenagers to experience life. There is really nothing good for teenagers out past midnight. Teenage life is one of the most difficult times in our lives as we still are trying to constantly learn. Teenagers do not understand when they are told why they can not do something or how to deal with rejection.

Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions. Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act. For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life.

302,1866,1E4E4216EB39,"I believe that schools should not adopt to a four day work week each consisting of ten hours. ten hours of school in one day is too much for a student. not only is this too much time for a student, but it would interfere with sports and clubs that they do. on top of that some students also have jobs that they have during the day. For some students sports and clubs mean so much to them. they might want that sport as a career. if student were to do the four day work week it would effect them physically and mentally. students might not even make it on time to that four oclock practice or that very important meeting because of the ten hours. being late, not getting much playing time in the sport you wanna exceed in, and worried about school work that you have to make up,and that could lead up to stress. ten hours in school is a lot of time and that could be too much for a student, it can lead to stressing over too much work and being tired. ten hours can take out a lot of a students day and could interfere with there schedule. student also need free time, with the ten hours they wouldnt have much time because of school work, sports, and jobs. in addition ten hours of school work is just a lot of time, not all student would have that kind of energy to work for ten hours. students have jobs after school and need money. therefore with these ten hours students wouldnt have much time to work because of school work and other activities. jobs are important to students because maybe parents dont give them everything they need for school. some students struggle with just there overall day schedule. ten hours would make it worse, and wouldnt be good for their heath. in conclusion students care about sports and clubs, also sees that as a future career. including that ten hours takes too much time out of your day and that you dont have much free time for yourself, family, and friends. students care about jobs because they need money to help them out with school and other things. ten hours in school just wouldnt be right in a whole day when you can only do so much.

305,1869,07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal. Im writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu. Im a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that. Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu. one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food. And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home. And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have. Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them. I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle. But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria. We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu. Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types. In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students. I know what im telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but iss very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food. one of the good thing and actually its the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying. the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter Im was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before. But htats fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like. Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig. Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food. Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food. But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

306,1870,161E5C8A6719,"Studies has been showed that students that been committing to their dream career before entering high school would be most likely to get their career more successful than other students. However, itll be a stressful/pressure thing for students because they would have to achieve it faster than others. The issue of students committing to a career at a young age is a stressful, mental thing, should not be considered because students would be more stress, they would focus on their future career and not themselves and high school makes everyone change their minds. My firsts reason why students should not commit to their career at a young age is because they would be more stress throughout high school. Yes, high school seems like an easy place to stick to your future career but at the same time its really not. If you commit to your career throughout high school, yourre more likely to be stress because you feel like okay if i do this ill achieve faster but not at the same time if i do this i wont be achieving. So technically you just put yourself in a position that you really cant get yourself out of. Youre focus on one thing that in your other classes its hard to think or studied about. Yes, committing is easy but its not. Itss high school the place where your education change you. You would probably change your mind no time soon. Therefore, dont put yourself in the position to be stress. Pressure is a main key to everything nowadays because its ""fun"". However, it is not. Being put on pressure is the most hardest thing to be in because you feel like you have to do it to make someone or somebody proud. Like in this case your future career. You feel like youre pressure because you want to make your parents, teacher, your school admins proud and know that you can really commit to things. As days or weeks goes on, the pressure level goes up and up and when that goes up you kinda get depressed, sad and not yourself because you are doing this for them and not you. High school changes everyone mind. As soon as, you walk into high school its not the typically high school movie you think. It is place where students and teachers minding their selves and doing their know things. Middle school vs. High school are two different place. The classes are harder, high school have many many electives to pick from so like of course you are going to change so like why would you want to stick to your career at a young age when your havent taken those other classes. Like your never know what you actually like when you have tried taken those classes. In my personal opinion i would not commit to career at a young age. i learned from experiences and from other. Take the classes that you like in high and if you like keep moving on. If not, move to a different one. What your see on TV is not want you see in reality. So again in my opinion Everyone is different, you are different. career is just a word. Dont push yourself at a young age.

Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I started to get better and better, I wasnt struggling anymore. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didnt let him take them off. He told me that if dont take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that id have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didnt take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasnt afraid. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage. Once youve done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. You are in this world to learn and grow. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if hes just a worker at McDonald. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that hes a hard worker. the manger realizes that hes got a big future ahead of him. Years later, hes a manager at his own company and is being successful in life hes learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible. Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone youd never thought you could be. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. Thats the point of growing. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.",6,7,8,7,6,7,3578,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
308,1872,2E8A8C550F8D,"This essay is about some schools offer distance learning as an option for the students attend classes form home by way of online or video conferencing , I think some students would benefit from take classes by their houses, because some students work in the night this is a problem for the students who working in the night because the school start 7:30 this is to early for some students because they work and they dont sleep well. Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between 5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life. Many students in high school work after school , I think this program can help they because they can continue working and they can sleep more , this can help they to have a better grades because they can sleep more because sometimes they have a bad grades because they dont have the time to do the homework and the study for the test . Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls dont want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when theyre pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because theyre to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes. For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they dont have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",6,5,5,4,4,4,613,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
309,1873,EB403A2AA1DB,"I would share that life is not easy. Enjoy your life as much as you can. enjoy your childhood. Because when you grow up you wont be able to go back In the future you will do a lot of responsible things. Enjoy it bore it ends. Everyone goes through something in their life. Everything will get better. Just dont think negative. Always look up never down. Cause if you do look down you wont see your bright future that will come. Do good things in your life. Like be nice to people dont be rude, disrespectful, and mean. Thats not going to help you in life. whats the point of being mean. Dont take your anger out on others. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Taking your anger out on someone who didnt do anything is not going to help. Itss making the problem worse. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson. Dont rush things in your life. Give things time, be patient. You dont know what can happen if you rush things in life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. thats how life is. Life teaches us a lesson. We need to believe, have hope in life. if we dont how can we know things will get better. We need to have hope to learn the lesson. The more you give hope the more you believe, The less you try everything is completely blind. For an example, I gave up and stopped trying. But that didnt help. Things got harder for me. I didnt have hope. But then i realized why am i thinking negative? and not trying. How is this going to help me in life. I opened my eyes and began to try. I started to believe. It helped me a lot. life is never easy. life is full of lessons that will teach us something.

I mean wouldnt you have loved it if you had a chance to visit a office and learn a couple things get some tips from people that have been doing this job jobs for years. I think that everybody should get a chance to goo into the field of what you like before you even think about going in. I think that I should have this opportunity to go visit to see what it is like learn a little from works that are doing this on a daily bases before I were get out of high school. For the reasons being I maybe not even really like it once I get out of high school after i do whatever it is to get to become a real estate agent what about if i dont love it anymore as much a I thought I possibly did back when i was in high school . I would obviously just be miserable doing something i dont even love also just wasting my time in getting all of this in place in order to get to where i wanna be and then not love it . Also If it isnt what i was expecting when i get a job in a agency it will be very dissapointinting to be working somewhere you feel like you have no choice and are unhappy with it. Thats one of the reasons I think it would get good thing for me to get a visit so i wouldnt have to go through all of that once I am getting ready to purse my employment. Getting to visit would show me what the process is into becoming a agent, how to successes in the business not to crash and burn and to be able to become as successful as I can be in this journey .

The technology makes our work easy. It helps you to save our time. Technology also help us to run a lot of businesses .But on the other hand most of the peoples do the missuse of technology and use it in different ways for example robbery,hacking,and the murders of different peoples. It also effects a lot on our new generation by inventing and by adding a bunch of vedio games in their computer or their phones. In past if you wants to read the book and to write a book for reading you have to go to the library and find the book and read it or if you wants to write a book you have to collect a bunch of papers and ink and it takes a lot of time to do it but,now because of the technology we are able to access every book online and we also able to write a book on the computer that saves our money to buy the papers and ink. It also saves our time. In Businesses the technology is really important because of this we are able to handle our money because the technology shows us in business that how much profit we get and how much we spend on the stocks and how much we spend to buy our products and also you can get your money in the form of direct deposits so quickly .We dont have to wait a couple of months to get our money. So, the missuse of technology is also one of the big reason. The hackers hacks the different websites and crash their important data or sometimes they enter into the websites of banks and transfer their money to a different account. Most of the peoples use the technology for robery or murders. They follow the person for the couple of days and check their every history that what time hes in his home or what time hes out from his home. So when they sees that nobody is at home. They go and do the robbey. Most of the teenagers and childerns do a lot of missuse of technology. They spent teir lot of times in watching movies or playing the vedio games of differnt types or kind. The rays that come from either our computer or our mobile might also effect eyes sometimes really badely. So in real if we have the advantages of technology we also have the dissadvantages of technology. Because every thing have opposite side. So,we are not able to do anything with the disadvantages but we are able to overcome the disadvantages. If there is no technology the world might be nothing. No body knows each other from a long distance. We still have a rular system on us. Without technology we are also not able to established the well maintained govt. and if there is no technology its mean no social media and we are not able to interect with each other from a long distances.",7,7,7,7,6,6,2904,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

For example, peoples try be IT programers, because someone say that they earn more money. But most people dont know, what it is and in this area most people are new. Their dont want work and their work are looks not good. After a couple time, they left this job and they trying somthing else. Only couple of them stay on this area. Another example is students. This year some students will be grated, and they dont come back to school again. Nobody dont ask ""Does student want go to school?"".

313,1877,CB892FB55B59,"How do you want people to see you as a good or a bad person? In my personal opinion I want to be the good one; to make it happen I have to show the best of me at the first time. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I think that it is true. There is no second impression, once is enough to show the kind of person that you are. There are three reasons why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friends. To begin with, I will become the person that no one would like to believe in. For example, if I show myself as a liar at the first impression, everyone will know that I am not the one or the incorrect person to believe in. Even though I am saying the truth no one would trust me, but the first impression can change it. My mom told me that doing the best since the begining will help me the rest of my life. She was right because of what she thought me, and I apply it in my life I see myself as the person who you can believe in. Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from others because I am not able to do everything by myself. Thats why I should make people to see me as a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard someone said that ""what I give to others is what I will recieve back from them"". What I understood is that if I do not help others, they will not help me. I always like to be the kind of person that help without waiting something back. I think that it makes my impression as a good one. Finally, I could lose friends or I would not have any friends what is even worst. Since the first time when I met my friends and showed them that I am the type of person or friend that is always with them no matter what. Furthermore, I have never betreyed one of them but if Ive would did it when we met, they already kick me out of their life. As I said before one of the things that can make me the best friend is my first impression, show them that I am loyal. In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, you can change them but it takes a long time and you will lost your patience waintig until it change. Thats why giving a good first impression will prevent problem for you such as; to not become the person that no one would like to belive in, to not get help from others, or to not have friends.

314,1878,1F7FD80F4396,"I totally agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson , being yourself around people of these days is complicated in the way that anything you do or you say is going to be judge by everyone , you will be the critique of your classmates,friends,family. Is basically most of the youth community feeling the pressure of being accepted by the society and they forget to be them and they start becoming someone else, just because the other person might have a lot of friends or they want to have the same popularity as them. 70 percent of the youth community either have depression or they get bully in high school. For the people who sees these type of actions and dont say anything because they are unprotected and are scared to be bully, first know that you can get help and you can be that person giving the courage to the other person feeling same as you. There are multiple reasons why you should want to be yourself and not just a copy. First put in your mind that you are unique , by the time you grow up the reality will come to show you that you dont need to impress anyone but yourself and all your actions is for you, your mistakes will affect you the most .When you are copying someone you should analyze what you win from it and is it really worth it ?.Now , ask yourself if the friends you have are really your friends,just because they walk with you and they talk to you doesnt mean they are your friends , and worse if they tell you to change who you really are. A real friend is that person that would love you and care about your own good, a friend is the one that appreciates you will all your defects. Someone changing you is someone you surely dont want in you life. Believe it or not is better to be alone than with bad friends,inclusive your own family can talk bad about you ,they might critique everything you dress,eat,but that isnt reason to change yourself and be what they are expecting you to be. When you are going to be a grown up, how can you tell someone to be always themselves when you dont even got to known the value of it. Being yourself is worth it, is loving who you are you wont be able to love someone else if you dont love yourself before. Having your own thoughts and always giving your honest opinions are good than just agree with something that you dont , being real is being you. Be real with your friends and if they dont like your opinions or they would make fun of you then feel happier that they finally showed their truth colors. If you cousins or any member of your family make fun of you because you unknown any argument they are talking about or they make fun of they way you dress then they arent family. Popularity is nothing compared to be yourself, somehow in any time you will feel so stressed ,sad ,and down and thatll be because you cant fake no more. Get you own experience, have your own goals in life, create your future. Instead of worrying about being accepted just worry about what you are planing for the future. Be a right person at least, dont copy someone ignorant , be a good well , always appreciate the appraisal of what you parents thought you and dont you ever feel shameless for it. In the future the success will be good recompense . Lastly be grateful to be unique in the world,be one in a million , always try to improve yourself and instead of going down go up , and if you think that copying someone that you think is up is being a winner you are completely wrong cause you are being a loser, know that there is a lot of mean people that could be around you and you might even call them friends when they arent .When people is jealousy behalf themselves they can do anything to ruin you when you think they are helping.

The reason that i think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and i know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing and he start to get into a lot of problems with our family.

I also think that active people are more likely to be successful,I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old and he was always doing something, and then whit the time he reach to be his own boss doing what he like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why i think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed. The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television i am sure that you wont be the first choices for them. In conclusion the reason why i chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals.",6,6,6,7,5,5,2668,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The best example is when AiDiSheng developed light blob he had thousands of fails but he didnt give up, he didnt loss enthusiasm,after more fails finally he made the first light blob in human life. It tells me If you dont loss your enthusiasm on something thing you focus on keep doing it you will done it perfectly like what you wished.

If you stop you will loss your enthusiasm on something that is attracting you just because they said are not going to make it, trust yourself keep trying dont loss your enthusiasm. In my opinion enthusiasm is not easy to have, the only ways to have Is someone or something that is attracting me. I would like to focus on I will have enthusiasm like video games I can play for a whole day,but I cant study for whole day It will be tough to me what If I have enthusiasm on study I will be success too.

318,1882,45E5B6DE09E9,"One of the most frequently debated questions in todays society is whether or not first impression are possible to change. Many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change. They say that is not possible and inevitable. I disagree with the statement. I believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them, everyone has different viewpoints, and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through. Words can also hurt! The first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions. The way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge. There is a famous quote that says, ""Our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch."" We all can relate to this, sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen; even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying. Nevertheless, everyone has different perspectives and view points, but just because we may think differently, doesnt mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations. There are millions of people in this planet, and every single one of us think and look different. We are all not the same. The complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this. It is good to have a great range of diversity, but the race we all come from cannot define us, nor the judgments that other people make from us. The last and final reason is that we dont know the struggles that the other person is going through. Sometimes, we may look tired, weary, or even depressed. Sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves. The judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life. Sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others. Decisions, such as the judgments from different speculations we make. As you have read, I disagree with the statement. I believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable. We are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing.",9,9,9,9,9,8,910,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

320,1884,CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school workers because they money they get payed will increase. 1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day. if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teachers use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teachers teaching everywhere they went and its very helpful, for an example they teachers was like your parents telling you to do something you dont wanna do they know is good for you but still you dont wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teachers was like back then in Generic_City, the more hours we had the more smarter we got . This evidence shows that the more time we got learning with our teachers the more smarter we got. clearly sometimes the teachers rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teachers get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject. 2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day. perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teachers because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hours was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like 1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to turn your work in its time to go innocent didnt have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done. after weeks innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teachers fault so he didnt blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all students and teachers. in addition for students to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class. clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect students grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush. In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student dont have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they cant and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didnt have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if students have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the students. if the school board add one hour and half the students grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

321,1885,5AEAF1C7B87C,"In todays world we believe positive attitude is not a key to success, only hard work is. However positive attitude is key to success. When we have positive attitude it helps us achieve our goals in life, at places such as: office, school, business and many more. On the journey of life we learn many things one of them is to have positive attitude in any hardships we go through. In companys employer looks for positive attitude in workers, simply because they want someone who can make company more successful. If workers have positive attitude toward their job it will make them more productive in job and lead company to success. Its very important to have positive attitude in life in order to succeed in schools and collages. Students who have positive attitude toward their studies are likely to succeed in life. For example students who have bad attitude towards their study they are not going to be successful in school simply because they are going to give up,compare to students with positive attitude. Businessman who are successful in their field compare to others who are not. One of the major difference is when successful businessman goes through hardships they keep positive attitude and try to execute the problem and it leads them to success and who are not successful they simply give up and gain bad attitude. As it said in our society that hard work is key to success actually its not only key to success. Having positive attitude is also key to success and it has many benefits for example helps us to achieve our goal in life and many more.

322,1886,0BEB8F7F5A64,"First impression are very important when you first meet someone. Many people say first impressions are almost impossible to change, but i strongly disagree with that. Majority of the time when we meet someone we already think of them in a certain way, but our judgment could always be wrong. Thats why i believe first impressions could always change. I believe that first impressions can change the way people think of you. Sometimes people can be irritable or just in a really bad mood because something is occurring in their lives, but in reality thats not how they really are. One reason first impressions can be wrong, is because maybe they didnt get enough sleep at night, and they have to get up early to go to work, or school in the morning. For example, i am not much of a morning person, so when i wake up in the mornings i can be rude, and people might not want to talk to me, but if you see me later in the afternoon i will be smiling, and laughing. Another reason first impressions could be wrong, is because they might not feel comfortable with the people who they are surrounded by, and be very shy, but once you start talking to them they change. For example, my best friend and i used to hate each other. I used to think she was annoying, and rude, and i am guessing she thought the same for me. One day we both started to talk to each other, and i found out we have many things in common, and that we are like the same people. That same day we became the best of friends, now we are basically like sisters. This is why i think that first impressions can always change. In conclusion, i believe that from now on as we move forwards in life we shouldnt assume what the other person is like, and not to always rely on first impressions because they could always be wrong.",8,8,7,9,8,8,158,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
323,1887,E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources. As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I dont agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesnt. Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, lets use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they arent really saving energy Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him. Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he wont get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we wont have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments. However, teachers opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they arent robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers. My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybodys benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the schools main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We dont know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we dont have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesnt have, which make us a different environment than the business.

324,1888,F591A84185A4,"I was thinking to work at the police station because I can work on cases that could allow me to travel around the world and some cases that can be cool and super fun. It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country. Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money. Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely. For example, On one Sunday morning you felt sick and a strange feeling you had something missing. You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick. All day you tried to erase the fact that you didnt complete you assignment, you tried to throw that thought away, but you couldnt. You wanted to not even think about and wishing the thought could just disappear. You felt like brain was rotting for thinking too, much. You called you best friend ( that also worked at the police station:) because you wanted some company. When she entered your apartment, she saw that you werent in the living room. She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you. Just then she started to stare at you, and you were reaching for a bucket of your favorite ice cream, strawberry. She looked at you and saw that you scooped a spoonful of ice cream and you shoved it into your mouth, with your TV on. (You were watching the Titanic with the lights off because you felt sad and had nothing to do) She went up to you and hugged you and asked what has happened to you and why you were feeling down. You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement. You went to go change and finished the assignment on time.

325,1889,F89738650EDF,"Self-esteem comes from achievement. My reason for saying this is because you shouldnt be getting praised for a low assignment that they did; then they are not going to grow. My other reason was that teachers are here to help students improve and if the student know they didnt the best they couldve and get praised for it; then theyre going to think that they dont have to do that much and will have a low self-esteem. To elaborate more on my first reason for why I say self-esteem comes from achievement is because if you do excellent on a paper and are positively sure you did amazing then you should be getting praised. That shows how much a student can have a high self-esteem for themselves. Even though, the paper probably wasnt easy that person didnt get lazy. They wanted to do better which means that they want to grow and improve not just stay where they are. I am going to explain my second reason for why self-esteem comes from achievement. This is all about the students and how they improve. Therefore, if a student knows they couldve done better on an assignment and get praised for the lazy work that did then they are going out think that they dont need to do that much work anymore. Although, as the teacher; they shouldnt be praising students on lazy work. They should pull them aside and say "" hey this was good but it wasnt you best work; I know you can do better"". My counterclaim is teachers shouldnt let students get away with lazy work. I say this because sometimes some students might think that the teachers dont pay attention to them or they dont care about their work. Even though, if the student approaches the teacher with a problem then the teacher will remember you and know to check up on you when it comes to your work. In conclusion, true self-esteem does not come from praise on an effortless assignment. If you praise students on a low assignment then thats the level they are going to stay at because they got praised to be lazy. Which means that the teacher leaves the student not wanting to improve and expand on their writing skills.

326,1890,D4269468970A,I agree with honesty because its good to be honest and make people trust you and believe in you and because you have honesty it will get you friends and teachers will like you as a student. And also it is respectful to be honest and if its your friend or family I think you should be honest because its your friend and they probably wouldnt care what you say if its mean because they probably know that you dont mean to be mean and that your just being honest with them. But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit. But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them. In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not. But you have to be careful on what you say with honesty or not because depending on what you say it could be a big situation for you if you say something wrong.,6,4,6,6,6,6,2953,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also its a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but its because you are who you are and no one can change you.

332,1896,E91F2E8986B2,"If you master a subject you like and dont try pushing your limits you wont succeed. Why wouldnt you want to push your limits? Theirs a reason why people get stuck in life, when they master their subject. They get fustrated when they cant find jobs or good pay wage. I agree on what Author Ralph Waldo Emereson because if you dont have that motivation on what you master it can affect you. If you dont push yourself into doing more than beyond than life will not treat you as you wanted. I agree on Author Ralph because Ive experience things in life that if you dont try on something , than you wont be able to grow. If you look at bill gates he master on his program and what did he do he share his product and open stores. He grew just by mastering his program. My experience was mastering in learning how rebuild a engine from just the block to how to make more power. Now im fixing peoples cars and doing tunes for their cars. I know these guys that called themself diesel brothers. They are master diesel technician. So what did they do? They bought a shop , got a crew and got sign to do a tv show. They work on diesel trucks, diesel cars and anything that is diesel. Then they decided to do custom trucks and custom military cars. That wasnt enough for them, so they came up with ideas to use military axles and putting them on custom trucks making those trucks so heavy duty they can even pull a train! My father told me that you should never stop, even if you reach that goal. He said,"" you reach that goal make another goal, you cant stop at what your doing and if you do,than theirs going to be bumps in the road and than your going to make huge mistakes."" just from those words its like million bucks to me. Why because if you stop at what you master ,than somebody is going to master it better than you ever thought and your not going to grow from it. When they master their subject, those people get happy right but whats next? Lets say you master your subject and than you find a job that pays good. The money looks good and you stay at that job for a couple of years. Id say that probably 75 percent of you staying at that job will make your miserable. People get bored and cant find nothing else to do,but do the exact samething over again. Its going to make you want ot quit and find something else to do. Then once you quit your job whats going to be in your mind? Probably nothing at the moment,but then your realize that you master that subject and want to share it, make it to your own business and improve from it. So I do agree on what Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote. I believe that if you dont go beyond your goal than you wont succeed in life. So make sure that you push yourself even if its harder. I promise you that you will succeed,have better thought, better examples and freedom. Remember having to do more you will get more in return.

I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late. Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldnt go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, theyd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. Im not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didnt make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didnt deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isnt so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different. Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isnt a problem with them going out when ever theyd like and dont think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doent have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe its okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when its dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around. In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do whats best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Mostly everyone can agree that their minnors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from getting into trouble.

There is lots kids in school and not all have the time to go to school, some kids have to help there parents work for there not financially stable. I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids cant cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this. high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hours of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster. Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older.

Working alone is fine because we dont get headaches from classmates; however, working in in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. Working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates, we get more opinions, and it takes less time doing the assignment. First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates. Each person has their own part to do and we finish it faster than do it alone. Working in groups is better because we will have more contribution from classamtes. Second, working in groups is better because we get more opinions. For example, every person in the group give opinions. We get more ideas if we are more than only one person. We dont have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help. Working in groups is better because we get more ideas. Finally, working in group is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. It will take less time because we will get more support and all the work dont will be completed just by one person. There will be more help and each person will do a little work what means that we will finish faster because it will take us less time doing the assignment than do it alone. Working in groups is better because the assignment will take less time to be completed. In conclusion, working in groups is better because we divide the work with our classmates, we dont have to think everything about the assignment because we will have thinking help, and the assignment will take less time to be completed.

336,1900,EBE0730AFF0E,"Adopting the failure is the way to become master and complete our goals. Everyone have experimented failure in some point of their lives. As the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss the enthusiasm"". But should we really continue pursuing success after fail many times, even knowing that, it might be really difficult?. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Actually, we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed in something that we wanted more than one time because, being consistent is a way the learn and become successful. Also, failure gives us more experience and mastery before we complete our goal. Those who believe that we should lose the enthusiasm after fail many times in what we want, have their reasons. They think that being pushing your self getting stress by starting something that you couldnt have done before, is a way to waste time because, youre not going to complete it anyways. They also believe that its really hard to start over again knowing that if you try it one more time you might fail it all the same even though you dont achieve success. One reason why we should not lose the enthusiasm after failure is that people learn from their mistakes. A way to learn is being consistent and do not give up, even if there are many difficulties that make us think that we should leave our goals and dreams. As example of this is my friend, Generic_Name, who had to take his math test multiply times. First, he took it at the first time without even study, as result of that he didnt pass it as well. Second, the teacher gave him a second opportunity to take it. This time he studied much better than the first time but he didnt pass it again, he felt stressful ""whats going on to me"" he said because, he knew that he needed to pass that test. Then, he asked to the teacher for a third chance to take it. But this time he studied really hard for many hours, he also knew what the test was going to be like because he had taken it before. As result he passed the test with a good score. What happened to Generic_Name is a perfect example why should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something couple times. If Generic_Name hadnt been consistent by studying and taking it more than one time, he wouldnt have passed the text. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail many times. Other reason why we should keep the enthusiasm even if we have failed something is that, failure gives us more experience and confidence before we complete or reach our goals. As example of this is my self. The last year I had lost to do, such as school, work and other responsibilities that required me to drive. Then, my parents decided that it was time to let me drive. I was really excited thinking in the way that my daily was going to change. But it wasnt that easy because, firstly, I had to pass the driver test, next learn how drive and finally get a car. In that point I wasns really sure if I wanted to continue with that. Then I decided con continue it and I went to take the test, I couldnt pass it at the first time. I felt sad about it, but after studying all the rules again I came back to take on this time I was able to pass it as well. But, I still needed to get a car, fortunately my parents brought me one. Now I have a car and my drivers license even though I was hard to make it. What happened to me is a perfect example of being consistent and dont give to get success. If I hadnt been consistent even that I had failed it, I wouldnt have gotten my driver license. Therefore we should never lose the enthusiasm after fail sometimes. In conclusion, based in those reasons I support Churchills statement, and Im agree with the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Although some say that we should give up after fail multiply times. Actually we should not lose the enthusiasm after have failed something that we want because, its a way to learn more and a way to build our confidence, and we also become successful by being consistent.

337,1901,6B20E9C115AF,"I believe that a possitive actitude has a good impression in othre persons. But there around you are person who can influence you to be a bad attitude peson with others. The decison you make to be who you are is to realize that other person will act the same way to you as you just did to them. Everyone need to be respected dont matter the age, country or religion becuase we all are humans. Been in a poaitive attitude will appeal the attraction of other persons to you by that will hepl you to success. Because if someone is being rude to them and you act different and start helping them they will notice that you have a good attitude to others that you dont even know. By the way you cannot judge someone just for their apparience is like judging a book with out reading it, it can be someone who will look with an angry face, a sad face even it can look weird but if you dont start sharing time, knowing each other, know what they like and what they do or how they are you cannot put your bad attitude just for how they look, they can also treat you as the same you did to them However, people cannot recieve a bad attitude from you as if they were different to you. I think that we all are same with some differences than others as religion, country, color, etc... . I feel that recieving a bad attitude from a person that you even know is the badest thing that someone can do to you becuase you dont know that person and if you show that reaction from you that means that youre like that with everyone and show that you dont have respect to others. Even in your job is when you need to be the more kind as possible to keep those person that you dont know with you becuase as they need you, you also need them at the same time becuase they will help you to keep that job that you need, also your impression to them has to be best, as you show them at work you also need to show the best of you out of work that will show that youre successeful person in life and that you dont act good just when you need it and that is how you are and they can also trust in you because you are being honest to them. Considerating that dont matter what you cannot give a bad treat to other person just because you woke up in a bad mood. I believe that if you are in bad mood and think that everthing is going to bother you is better for you to figured it out as soon as posible on you own, because people can not be involved with your own personal problem and i think even if you are not felling well you also need to be in a good attitude to the people because if you let you bad attitude to ruin the days of other they will think that youre always like that and will be enough to them to think the worse of you. However knowing that you don feel well and you gave the best of you to others before, that will be a great acomplishment for you and from now on you will be and example and will help othres that feel the same as you to continue and leave that bad mood behing and show the best of them. In conclusion a good attitude is one of the important things to success in life. I think that every person have the right to be respected not for what they have is just we all need respect. People cannot be treat it bad because of you mood or just because you didnt like how that person is. Doesnt matter what you cant act bad with other persons, even if you dont know them and think that you will not see them again but the reality is that in other day you can really need from that person but that person will not be there for you because of how you acted before.

I feel like that we do a lot if we are always doing something and not inactivity. while some may argue if inactivity have a purpose in this I think not, I believe that we can do a lot and accomplish more if we are always doing something because you might want different options from different people, two or more people work better then just one, and you dont have to worry about doing all the work on your self and be worrying about finishing it on time. Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out. Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didnt know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area. In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not. Why because, I believe we accomplish more if we are doing something and working on it because it might get you somewhere in life or better you future and help you in the long run. By sitting down and doing some of the work might not get you as far as the person that accomplish it and will be so much better then the person the accomplished some of the work.

341,1905,C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators. One of the first lessons Ill share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you dont be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use theres other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"". Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life its always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities youll get. Lastly, being good communicators. In life youll always have to communicate if its your friends, teachers or your family, youll always be communicating. For an example, I cant communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I dont want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends. And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators ",7,7,6,7,8,6,2638,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

It is not fair for the student to force them to stay any longer than the regular school time, it can simply miss up the whole plain of students after school activities. The school should not extending the school hours, because student might have activities and practice after school, and it is the right for students to choose to stay in school when the school is ended. For example, I have a lot of after school activities, and I always schedule them by looking at the time where school ends. I usually have music lesson right after school, it will be not convenient for me If the school hours are extended. I have to reschedule them, and decides with my private teacher. I might not have the time for the class because my private teacher and I are both very busy. The extending of school hours have the possibility to make me not taking the music lessons,because the conflict of the time. It is absolutely not worth it because , none of the new stuff will be taught in the extended hours, and we will most likely have more homework than usual. If we have more homework and more hours at school, our grade will most likely decrease because since many activities are squeezed to a short chunk of time, we will have less time to do our homework. In addition, It should be optional for students to stay on after school sections. However, there are people who have very few after school activities, and they are welling to stay in school. That is why school have after school sections. Instead of extending normal school time, we should let students to go on after school sections because it is better for the student to manage their own time and it is more beneficial for them. Students can stay in school for two hours every day in the week after the normal school time. There are many options for students to choose. Students can choose to study with a teacher in certain subject or work in the library if they want to study. Students can also go to the gym and play sports or even join a club like drama. Any options that students choose is benefit for them because they are learning in different kinds of way which might be more helpful than their regular class. It is clear that when students have trubble or issue in a subject, it is better for them when they come to the teacher one on one after school, because it is easier for them to understand the problem and it is easier for the teacher to only explain to one person. Over all, it is a bad diction to extending the school time. It will not help or benefit the students and it is a wast of time for the students.

345,1909,72635AF44FA7,"Some schools use cellphones in the classrooms for educational purposes. Allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom may have a positive effect in the education of the students, who use their cellphones frequently. In other words, it will make students feel better about doing their classwork. Because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and students will learn better. One positive effect of allowing students use their cellphones in the classroom is that students will have a chance to finish their classwork or homework. Some students have classes that left many homework, so that means that they may need more time to finish their assignments. Moreover some students have personal issues, for example; Sometimes I can not focus in do my homework because I may have a problem that blind my mind and that makes me feel stressful, and that does not let me work on it. Also some students have jobs after school, for example. I have a job after school and sometimes my tiredness is huge that it does not let me finish my homework, and I can tell that it is really difficult, so having this experience I think that it would be really good that school allow students use their cellphones in the classrooms to educational purposes. Another reason is that students will have the chance to check their grades or assignments. Some students miss school and they probably does not if have assignments, or they does not have time to check it in home. Most of the students forget easily that they have homework, for example; Sometimes when I get home and I started doing some of my labors and when I notified it is already time to sleep, so they next day I do not have any time to finish it. Therefor it will be good to most of the students check what they are missing during class, and they can probably ask the teacher for permission if they can work on what they are missing. Also ask for help to the teacher if they does not know how to do it, for example; I had a friend that math is hard for him, so he check his assignments in the classroom and ask the teacher for help to understand better, so I think it will help students to get their grades better. Some people say that the allow of using cellphones can cause a negative effect is because it will distract students, for example; some teachers say that students will be doing something else, like texting or playing video games, in other words students will not pay attention in class. Whatever they are incorrect because students will a better way to learn, in which one they will feel comfortable. The point is make feel that they can learn in an interesting way, for example; Some teachers let students play trivia games on their cellphones, so students can learn and have a good time doing it. They will learn better because most of the things that students look in their phones they are capable to memorize it. May be the pass generations think that the use of too much technology, like allow the use of cellphones in the classrooms is a bad idea because it will make our brains slow is not true it just help us to learn in a better way. In conclusion, the school allowing the use of cellphones in the classroom will have a positive effect because it will help students finish their school work or homework, check their grades and assignments, and they will learn better. We are the new generation and the future of the next one, we have the help of technology to get a better knowledge. The future is on our hands and make it easy is our decision. They are just finding better ways for us to learn and educate better because they want us to succeed in school, like in our lives.

For instances; I have seen a girl leaving a fake life to accomplish what see want, but at the end of the day she was caught, their is a company who need someone who is rich and popular to be the director of the company and will be paid thousand of dollars every week. This lady try to live a fake life and decided to go for the post, when she got there every single person believes that she is rich and famous,and she has to compete with other lady who doesnt lives a fake life. she is so poor but have the work experience and was talented,after some days,weeks and month. It now the time to choose the leader,they both seat separately with their heart beating vastly,the lady living a fake life have the 100% assurance that she will wi the contest, here comes the judges to call our the winner,the speaker gives a speech about each of them. The speech goes as; After we have camp both ladies for some month will we sure;y choose the leaders but here with me some evidence about those ladies,their is girl among you two who lives a fake life to get what she want and there is another girl who didnt do that, this position is given to the girl who does not leave the fake live because if this position is given to you who live fake life you will surely ruin this company by embezzled and faking this company,the speaker says she borrowed almost $500,000 from banks,two house and 3 brand new cars to fake her life and at the end she did not accomplish what she want,likewise the other girl who be herself in this world and finally fulfill her dream and have greatest accomplishment. With this little words of mine i will like to convinced not to confused you that living your real life in this live that is constantly trying to male you something else is the greatest accomplish but if you try and fake your life in this world you will never accomplish anything than public disgrace if you later got caught.",5,6,7,7,6,6,2252,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
348,1912,D01F88C1F2A0,"I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change, people can have different impression and different changes no one has the same attitude as others .Sometimes they dont even change because they dont care about it, and some of the people they get altered on something or on someone, its based on what experiences people already had . Some people dont even change when they have their first impression because they dont even care about it and people can change when they really give them a bad impression about them. Sometimes they keep doing the same thing every day and they dont even care about other people who are talking about them. But when they get another impression they start to think on what they did wrong and they analyze it. People start to change when they really need to change who they are. And to change takes time some people dont change quickly because they can commit the same thing without thinking it. People can get impress on relationship about betraying each other, they can get altered on something or on someone . In a relationship their are always going to have problems it could be jealous, toxic, and bad influence. Many adolescents are dying just because they give them a impression about her/his boyfriend betraying them with another one and they dont even think about how hard is goig to be to that person knowing that they betraying them in that moment. Being on a relationship is not to impress others that they can get jealous at, sometimes changing is hard but its a good way to have a good relationship. In my experience, when I had my first impression I think that it was impossible for me to change myself. In that moment when they told me that I was a girl who disappointed other people about my attitude, I really feel very disappointed in me that I think negative everyday. And that I can not do what other people are good at. It was impossible for me to change my attitude because I was use to things that it was good for me but for others was not. So one day I say that I was going to change who Im no matter how hard it was but it was going to be possible for me to change with or without help. I believe that when people have their first impression on something they can change. changing is a good way to show to everyone that you are not the same person you use to be, and that every impression that they going to give you is going to be a way to try and to not commit the same thing in the future. People can say that its impossible to forgot what we did in the past but when we try every day to forget it, we can get better to it. Everyone are not perfect but we can get better at changing our attitude on not trusting people who we think that its not the kind of people were are going to trust.

349,1913,03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future. The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight As. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever. The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like im on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like im on top of the world, I want something big for me."" Many students may say that they dont care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""Whats the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we dont need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendys."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school. In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, Im most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well. My cousins really have inspired me, because of them and their story, I want to be better and I want to work harder. Maybe later in life I will be working for the government and I will make my future kids happy.",8,9,9,9,9,8,45,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
350,1914,1721F085F81E,"I disagree with this statement because your first impressions of someone or something can change overtime. When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things. Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days. First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesnt like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time its going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person. there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldnt figure out where ive seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didnt we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and havent seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday. The first impressions arent always impossible to change, you learn to change your mind overtime and start accepting things for what it is.

So will you just give up if you failed? and of course, people will judge you because youre not perfect. Thats why Winston Churchill once said ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Some people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement. In life, you will fail a lot of time but its important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes. To begin with, a lot of people thinks failure will only make you look bad and some thinks its the end of the world for them but thats not the case. Every each person make mistakes and having a motivation in your self will get your somewhere: however, when a person is lack of motivation in their life, they wont be as much successful and failure will take over. Secondly, when it comes to hard times, a lot of people say that theres no point of trying if youre meant to be a failure. Every each person in this world know that theyre capable of, and every each person know what their weakness are. However, having encouragement wont mean anything because if youre encourage enough, you will get back up and do anything you can to be successful. At last, learning from your mistakes is the key to be successful. You will fail and fall but its very important that you get up and keep fighting because once failure takes over, it will be hard to get back up. Also you will need to earn the key to success, but once you find it, you will achieve anything in life not because you didnt give up but because your learn from your failure and mistake. In conclusion, people say you could use your failures as your motivation and encouragement and in life, you will fail a lot of time but its important that you keep fighting and learn from your mistakes.

Lening reached his goals because he was never idle, for he was always doing something in his life. Although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; Medicine, 3D Animated Cartoons and CyberSecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others. Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after. If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it. Being inactive for a while its good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldnt wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. Its always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name.

Many people think that, behind of every success is your hard wroking, and also achievment without hardworking is impossible. In my opinion inactive people are not have a good future. So they should always do something new to be able to accomplish because, to have a bright future, always successful in our life and being a good personality in our community. Every people wants to have their best future and wants to have their best life, all of these things comes by how you put yourself in a hard time. It is obvious that without nothing anything we not gonna accomplish. Accomplishment is always comes by how hard work you do. Inactive person do not have a bright future. Inactivity makes people tired of their life because they dont have any plan for their future, they just live for no idea, with no hopes. So it is better to think about our future and build our future from now. Being successful in our life is what everyone want. Every body want they way to find they key of success. But the person who get successed, they actually did accomplish new things. They things that makes our future bright and that we can have a good life and carrer is to work hard, focus on one main thing that make our carrier and believe in ourselves which has the important view in our life. Being inactive person is really useless in our community. We cannot be anything in our future if we be inactive. Obviously everybody choose to have a good personality in their community. Having a good personality makes everyones to proud on you. To accomplish a good personality we should makes our thoughts and education higher. Without having a main goal in our life we cannot achieve our aim. Education is the only way for success so by having a good education and carrer we have more attach with our community and we get respect from our community. Inactivity is not the way that we can accomplish more. I think inactivity does not serve a purpose it just makes your brain stop so you could not be able to accomplish. People should always try their best to make their life easier and it is become by hard work. People who has inactive in their life they will hurt in the future. Successful people always did something before in their life so now the successful in they have a comfort future.

354,1918,E0553AEE109E,"Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. I do not think this is a good idea. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students. Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation. Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer. Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress. Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people.

I think that when you decide make the things for yourself is because you are ready to confront the different situations that the life give you. The individuality is one that pursues a markedly independent course in thought or action. That means that your actions have influence in you, all that you doing have a purpose. For example, when you want something but is spend, you work hard for it, and can get it. This going to make you happy because just you know how you worked for buy it. Be yourself in the world is not simple, need to have good thoughts, these are the key for the most big accomplishment. For example, when someone tell you do this, you need to think about it, and decide it is good or not , if is something bad that going to affect you. Some people no want that you win or protrude in the life, or not believe that you can do. But you need have the capacity to show them, that you can and not need help for obtain it. Accomplishment is the quality or ability, the result of something. Make big accomplishment for yourself, teach you that you can do all that you want, but only if you believe and have trust in you. Sometimes we dont something that we want for fear, because think that the result not going to be favorable or how you thoughts. For example, sometimes many opportunities came for your life, and you never accept. But when you take the decisions of do, you see that is possible. Now know that you are able to do anything that you want. In my conclusion be yourself in the world is good, because your learn about the life, also to do things that you not believe possible. I think that good thoughts can make you successful. Also I think that do all individuality is not easy, but not impossible. The biggest accomplishment only are caused when you do things for yourself. That is why I think that be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",7,6,8,6,6,7,1815,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

365,1929,3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach. I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students. Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to. Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home. Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it. Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families. ",10,8,8,8,8,8,818,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

When a person gets older they learn between right and wrong. for example a person should never spend their money on something they dont need and knowing if they do theyll be broke and have financial problems. people know what are the needs and wants in life, they learn this through out life and the one to make the decisions. High school is where people start to have an idea or know what you wanna do as a career. In high school you get to meet a lot of people and make new friends, in addition you make a lot of decisions. The decisions people make and ask their self are, should i be friends with this person, should i go to this class, and sometimes people dont wanna continue school. more over people wanna experience a party in high school so they sometimes make the decision to go and drink or do drugs, but end up getting in serious problems. In the end people make the decisions. When a person turns eighteen they are an adult now and probably out of high school. People are either in collage or working when eighteen. Thats a decision people make before graduating and thats a very important life choice. Sometimes people make the decision not to go to collage or sometimes go to collage then drop out and thats a decision a person makes because they think its the best for them. in conclusion people make decisions and learn from it. People know between right and wrong, need and wants, and what they wanna do in life. You also make mistakes in life and sometimes you need to make that mistake in order for you not to make the same decision again. At the end of the day people know what they want in life and know the decisions they make. Guidance from others is a idea or option, people will still have to make the decisions.

371,1935,7D2D5053D947,"What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isnt bad because their no one to rely on. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project. Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself. Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same. Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and cant get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands. In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone.

375,1939,22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose. My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not. Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break wont be long studens wont forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows. Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools dont close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when its spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests. My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School wont be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions. ",7,6,5,6,7,6,464,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

And when we do that, the only one who will get hurt is us, if we are and behave exactly as we are may be there wont be too much people around us but that is not the most important accomplish, the most important accomplish is when we learn how to love our self and be who we are no matter if there wont be a lot of people surround us, if someone will loves me it has to love me for who I am not for who I pretended to be. Everyone in this world deserve to be love for who they are, no one needs to be someone else to be love or accepted , we have to stop trying to be someone else just to fit with a group of people because if youre not like them, then thats means that you dont belong to that place. Been who we are is what makes us special, there are no specifics forms that forces you how to be, pretending it wont make you happy. Just will make you feel that you dont deserve to be love, it will make feel desolate, it will make you feel that you are not funny as the rest of your friends. But when we learn how to be our self in this world where it constantly triying to make us feel or be someone else it is the greatest accomplishment, because when we know how love our self for who we are and how we look then we will be capable to love someone else for who they are not for who they pretend to be. Feeling like you dont deserve to be in this world is not the best feeling sometimes all you wanted to do is just go to a place where nobody knows you, where you want to start over again and do what you really love, be who you are and if someone gets to knows you it will accept you the way you are but something that we cant see is that we dont actually needs to go to the other side of the world to start over because we can try to start with our self, we have to start loving us the way we are. Why do you think that sometimes we feel desolate too? Do you think that is because we are been honest we our self? It is important to ask our self that question because it makes us think about our self for a minute and forget about the rest of the people about what they would think of me, most of the time we forgot about our owns feeling about how we gonna feel at the end if we do or behave the way that the society is asking us to do. And when we forget about our self that is the time when we feel desolate, and what can fill that what we think is missing? Is learn how to be our selves. If youre not funny as they want you to be or they might say that you have to be like the rest, thats not right because you will make yourself to a side and you will start been someone whos not you, someone you dont love but you have to be that way so you can be accepted and when that happen you are losing the greatest thing you have inside of you to give... Been who we are maybe it wont makes us see the perfect person in the world but it will make you happy to know that you have accomplish the greatest goal! Which is to be yourself in a world that always wants you to be someone else. Now that I had learn how to love myself Im able to see that everyone deserve a change to be themselves, to show what they have, learn how to be you it also help you to see the beauty in the rest of the people that is surround you it also makes you free to stop thinking that they need certain things to be love or accept.

Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school. If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat. And because i can have more free time i can do more things and i can have a job. And think too for some student is not good because they dont have the opportunity to have a computer t do they classes online or they dont have internet is difficult for them. Is a good option online classes but not for all students some of them are benefit and some of them dot. Only classes are a good reason to use because is a good way to cominitate in a long distance, but Free online schools, have to be free all schools online for all students they dont have to pay nothing. The time if they take online classes they they go not miss nothing because they can star when they want. On my oponion is a goog way to do it.

380,1944,B3AB4E6C5678,Dear principal I think that we should have policy number one. All student should be ably to use there phones in their free time & in lunch. Its better to have them off in class time. Because if we dont then the student wouldnt learn. They should be turn off or it should be low. Some student would really like this idea about using phones in there free time. There some student who dont like to go to lunch or like to eat and by using there phone they have something to do. The teacher get mad when there standing up by having there phone i dont think they will be. Most kids use there phone in school when the teacher dont look so its better to have the rule about only in free time. By having this rule i think it will make kids be better because if there not then they will not be ably to use there phones. That what most kids like and want to be ably to use there phone in school. Not all kids have phones so to make it far for everyone the rule should be phones and ipods only in there free time .Think this would work good as a rule but we need to try it first. In high school you can use it so why not middle school. Kids should start see how it work with the phones in high school. So they can have in idea about it. But not everyone is going to think how i do but i think we should try it for a week or two to see if it works. But think that policy number one is a good one and a good idea. We never now if we dont try. We should try if it work we keep it if it doesnt then we just say it didnt. But we can say at least we tried. For some student it will work good but for some it wont. Some will have hard time with it but other wont. Most student do there homework when there testing and do good in there class. Maybe is not a bad idea doing this new rule about the cell phones. we should all look at this there some good things about having this rule and yes there some bad ones too.

381,1945,5BE99F2E4030,"Have you ever been thinking about doing something fun and active outdoors with your friends and family? Well, Im going to share with you some ideas of having a great time outside. I like to invite my friends over and play with my dog outside. Or if you and your family are going on a trip or vacation, you might go to the beach. But what is it that makes these activities fun? Sometimes you may not feel like going outside and just want to stay inside and play video games, which is fine sometimes but you cant just play video games all the time. You should go outside and be active more often. Like I said, if you have a dog you should always play with them because its fun for both of you! Dogs tend to make everyone feel happier inside and they help reduce stress. Another great outdoor activity would include playing sports. Playing sports is one of the most fun activities you can do outside with other people. Sports like basketball, soccer, football, baseball, volleyball are all great fun activities for outside! One amazing enjoyable activity would include going a near by park because theres so much to do there! You can do a variety of fun activities such as playing with your dog, playing a sport, you can go on the swings, you can go on the slide, run, jump, you can have so much fun at parks! Sometimes when I get stressed or upset, I like to go outside with my dog and just observe the great outdoors. It makes me feel a little bit better and my dog helps me reduce my stress. I love my dog so much and so do a lot of other people. They are really fun to play with and spend time with. Going on walks is fun for me and my dog. Walking your dog in the neighborhood is a great way to get out and be active. Doing outdoor activities is great for everyone because you can have fun with all your friends and family and feel strong and energetic. Even if you dont like the activity, you should give it a try. Or, if youre feeling down, maybe an outdoor activity will make you fell better. I talked to you about the benefits and the different ways you can have an enjoyable time outside.

382,1946,A5E9417DBC88,"Have you ever thought about how many people are ""success by going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm?."" This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge. Once I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so I will never give up for any reason. This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake youre wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle. Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others. On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say I can use it to improve my self. To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way. Failure give knowledge and a better change to improve yoursel. ",5,6,6,4,5,4,2225,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
383,1947,39929B24673E,"The success is something that everyone gets one day. Some persons dont success, because they maybe dont have the opportunities to success. Others persons dont success because they dont want to success, they dont want to be a impotant person, with a perfect job, or house. Success sometimes have something bad; to get success, in jobs, or in life, people go throw a lot of bad things. I agree with Churchills statement, its a true statement, and so important too. First, people have to have enthusiasm, if people lose enthusiasm they breakdown, they deteriorate. Failure make some people more weak, and others so hard in thinking in perfect things for there life. Failure is something that every person have, or they go throw failure before. People can failure in jobs, people get fire from there jobs they failure. Second, failure plays a amazing role in the pursuit of be better; However, when people failure to much, the perfects things come after. In peolpe life something chance when they go throw to much failure. They think different way, they see the thinks differents. When people failure, they start thinking in different way, because they go from failure to failure. People maybe think that they are not going to be a respect, or a important person, thats why they think like that. However, some people failure a lot of time, but they dont care they try again, and if they failure they try again, they dont stop trying they dont loss enthusiasm. Example: A person go to a school, to find a job like a teacher, he want to be a english teacher, they went to the main office to talk with the principal. She said, "" We dont need a english teacher in this school, we already have one, and he is so amazing in his job."" The teacher went to the other school to find job. He went in, and talk with the principal, she was so nice, and she accepted him in the school as a english teacher. He was so nervous, and so happy to hear what the principal said. He did not loss enthusiasm, the first school he went they tell him that they already have a english teacher, and they dont need another one. The second school accepted him, and now he is a english teacher, because he didnt loss enthusiasm. He failure in the first school, but he success in the other one he went. Last, Some persons are amazing to failure, but others are angry, or sad to failure, there is different types of persons. Some they like to failure, some they dont like to failure. All the persons failure in one time in their life, but they maybe success when they failure. Some success and they dont failure anytime. Enthusiasm is something important that any person have not to loss it. Success is something in your life, but people go throw a lot to get success, they failure and failure, and than get success. Some people dont success, because they dont want or they cant. Once people success, others are going to success too. A person success everyone success. People have to not loss enthusiasm to success.

384,1948,80D2FE30F665,"Offering distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing by schools is a good idea, but I take a position on this issue to say that, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes classes from home due to the following reasons. First of all,some students when offered distance learning will not pay attention to their lessons. They will distracted either by their cell phones or electronic devices. And we all know students always like to be on their cell phones at anytime and anywhere. Also,Students can be distracted either by their parents or siblings which may cause them lack behind ahead of their lessons. So when all of this happens , students may be delayed which will cause them to fail and waste of time. For example,my cousin came to the United States of America with his siblings and he was permitted to to take one of his subjects or courses online. And anytime he gets home,he doesnt get a peace of mind because of the disturbances and worries from his siblings. Due to this,he fell apart in his studies which caused him to fail the course. Another reason is that,some students finds it difficult and boring to learn on their own pace. Because they encounter a lot of problems in their studies. Students finds it very hard to understand lessons without the presence and explanation of a teacher. And again,students finds it very boring when learning on their own because there is no form of oral conversation between the teacher and student. Some students prefer being active in studies rather being dull or inactive. So when all these happens,the students may skip the contents because he or she doesnt get any understanding, or close the contents and go to sleep. For instance,I had a friend who was struggling with these same problems,he feels bored and difficult to understand in distance learning. So anytime he gets to sit for the lessons,he feels sleepy during a short period of time. He sometimes drink a whole cup of thick coffee but it doesnt make any changes. So what he does is to off the computer and go to bed. And this hinders his academic performance each year. Lastly,students feel fatigue or weak in distance learning since they dont get time to take rest after school. Some students even have to close work after school before taking the online class. With these,it makes student lazy and sleepy when he or she sits in fronts of the computer to learn. And me myself is experiencing this problem. When school closes, I have to walk half a mile before I gets home,and from there,I work on my assignments and take my shower. So by the time I will be done,then it is getting late, and I still have to take this classes online. I feel tired in learning at times which retards my level of learning. From these reasons, I would like to conclude that,students would not benefit from distance learning because there are so many disadvantages from it which has brought low level academics in their studies.

385,1949,77A31D0A07A8,"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow "". Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emersons statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in . Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you dont know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day. However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids, teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke. Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff. In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doent help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches.",5,6,6,6,5,5,1560,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
386,1950,8F78E9AF1D0E,"Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning. Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better. We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. For example, you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits. Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something its frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things ",6,7,7,8,7,7,1907,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
387,1951,56F9E8427D97,"I raised by my grandparents and they always told me that curfew is curfew no matter what. To me, old peoples advice are really important and efficient. Curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because individuals get home on time, chance to get saved by dangerous situations, and they can do something else at home. Some people think curfew is unfairly interfering their lives. For me, it is not because I have an experience that I should need a curfew. First of, you can go outdoor and hang out with your friends, shopping in the mall, playing sports and doing some assignments from school work. Moreover, you should have to go home on time because some parents are waiting for their child to come back to home safe so, they can sleep in peace. In my experience, it happened long time ago. I went to my friends birthday party and we were having fun. I knew that I break the curfew rule but I did not mind it as it was a big deal. After my friends birthday party finished and everyone went to home including me. My friends house was not far from my house, so I walked. I started realized that someone was following behind me. Second of, teenagers whom are under 18 years old can be saved by dangerous situations if you follow the curfew rule. In example, what I heard from my friend was that she was outdoor and hanging out with her friends when her mother called her to come home early but she did not listen. She get home around 12 oclock in the night chased by drunk male person. At that time, my friends phone battery died and does not have any money with her. All she can do was ran and tears were coming out of her eyes that couldnt stop. Third of, curfews might be different for every individuals but it is usually 10 p. m. If you come home at 10 p. m not breaking the curfew rule. You have lot of time that you can spend in your home including work on school work, watch interesting movies, read fantasy books, or you can do whatever you want to do at home. 4 years ago during winter break, Me and my grandmother went to a store to buy a handcream and it was dark and freezing outside. We were on the way to home, but one stranger black tall guy put a gun on my grandmothers head and we gave him the handbag and the wallet. We ended up crying and shocking. Finally, all those things happened to me in the past. I learned a lesson which is listening peoples advice is really important in your life because lot of teenagers are out of control in this ages which are 15-18. Taking things serious is not useless it is more powerful and useful in your life. Curfew is one of the warning that can take you straight to your home safely.

Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents dont want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self. For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they cant because they have no way to get to school.

Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world.

391,1955,11DD0B26B584,"Although some say schools should not offer classes online because when students are out of school someone else could be doing the work for them and they will not be learning anything, actually schools should offer classes online because most of the students who go to schools have to work and they drop out of school to work and taking classes online would help them be educated at the same time theyre working. Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school its hard. They are falling asleep in class and they dont want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime. Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and thats what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldnt happen. In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they dont have to wake up early every morning.

392,1956,AD730017246A,"Prime Minster Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" This quote indecteds that becoming successful is a lie in life that dose not have challenges,failures and have hard time in life to achive your goals and, without making it intersting. However, a lot of people belives this quote, because success is nothing with haveing enthusiasm and, lossing or being fail on something and being positive about it. First, Haveing successful life without challenges is result of being fail in your success. The reason why you should have challenges in life to become a succesful its to make you a a better person in life and to make you a critical thinker and to garner your all skills and your talents for the better future. For example if you face your challenges later in life you would have the benfits from that hard or easy challenges. secondly, makeing you challenigs intersting would led to be come successful, the reason why because having intersing and positive attuide towards your challengs would make it easire to handle. For example if your lossing a bussines or challnge do not bring nagitive atomsphere around it because it would never let your mind to have more oppotrunity that you could done more. In my piont of view, failing or lossing is lie if you do not try hard for the intersting and successful goals.

393,1957,AFBC394080FC,"Are you agree or disagree with the statement of Emerson about individuality? Im agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, one example is because when you be yourself some people feel comfortable, but some doesnt but there is nothing more important than be yourself you dont know the things you can get done when you challenge you. And yes the world is going to take you down, is going to face you with things that will make you do wrong things, or change your mind like trying to be another person. But you has to face it dont give the rights to people to take you down. People when they see all the things you get done, they start to hating you. But you dont has to listen to then you dont has to change your mind just because they are talking. Some people want to decide for you, i mean like for example; when you want to study a career but your friends, parents, etc they told you to study something you dont like, you dont has to listen to them you can make your own choice if you are a grow man you are going to do what you like, thats why you has to always be yourself, doesnt matter the circumstance. You see me my father just left, he let me alone with my mom she work hard that i could be here, and i see that thats why im always try to be my self i try to work hard ever single day because the effort she did for me !bruh! is amazing. On my country the gangs shot you for no reason and i grow with my grandma and the gangs they live around us but all that i never change, i could ed be one of them but i grow with a really good education and didnt wasted. I didnt pretend to be a person that was not me and as the author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""is accomplishment to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else"" Always be yourself dont change your mind, because life is hard nobody said life is going to be easy you has to work hard for your own things, to be someone in this life and dont listen to the world because the world dont want to see you grow or happy. Dont listen to it. Just trust on god and yourself, and you will see the the amazing things you can get done by your own.

I think you should live your life how you want it to live it, what you want to achieve in the future, what is your main goal to do when youre done with high school or college. Nobody cant make you want you dont want to do life because its your life not theirs they cant tell you what you can do or not, like no youre the that can control you body, mind and life not them. The one person who has my back since I was kid and encourage me to keep from giving up in life is my older brother. My brother has taught me some many things that are good and what are bad in life. He told that I can live my life how I want it to live because nobody cant make your decisions what you want or not to do. He told me that he has gone through a lot things in the past like the people that he called as ""friends"" or ""family"" try to take advantage of him what he didnt want to things that they wanted him to do, so what he did was that is he spoke up to all the people that wanted to do this and that you cant tell him what to do or cant push me to doing things that he doesnt like. Then after all that he learned that he will never let the haters get into his head and take his life and use him like a toy, so he told me that is that if people try to do use you or say that cant be this in the future all you have to is do ignore everyone who tries to get in the way in the way of your life. Fight for what you desire in life, dont let anyone get in negativity go through your head just turn it to them something postive or take that negativity and use as motivation to make you work harder in life to show them what you can do by yourself.

395,1959,750184492A96,"Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. Students should not have after school homework club because you wont have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they wont be able to play their favorite sport. First of all, students wont spend time with their family. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. This proves that after school can affect on family time. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant just because school. Secondly, students wont be able to play sports. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. For example, Generic_Name plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career. Finally, if you like video games their is only video games on the weekend if take this club. You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he cant stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didnt got to do on the club and is to late for him. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club. After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. Its difficult to do two things at once so dont do after school club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Dont do after school homework club if you dont want extra time in school. ",6,5,5,6,5,7,1521,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that determine never to be idle which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then wouldve never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we wouldve never had what we have now. Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people wouldve been inactive. Everything that we built and invented wouldnt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably wouldve been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there wouldnt be any people working or there wouldnt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We wouldve been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future. We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose.",6,6,7,8,7,5,1655,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
397,1961,B6F445EE304C,"Dear principle: I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea. Students mostly dont try hard unless theyre rewarded. If you change this policy maybe students will try on theyre best to get a grade B or above. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities. On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If kids try their best on the subject and still dont get a grade B average, this wouldnt be fair to them. They would be a lot of students who wouldnt agree with me because of this reason. Changing school policy isnt a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea.

398,1962,5F1183463E9D,"Thinking ahead of time of what you want to do after high school before you start high school may or may not be a good idea. For example it might get you prepared for what classes you can take your first year of high school. Because high school is all about getting good grade and getting the help you need to become what you want to become in life. High school is where you get your real start to your future. And here are some reasons why. Thinking about what you want after high school before you even start could be beneficial to you. For example for some it might come as motivation. As in they are at a low point in life where things arent going so great, they could think about what they want tot do and see them selves in the future becoming what they wanted to become. It could even benefit you your first year of high school like picking your classes. You would pick the classes that are most related to the career you want to pursue. Another big thing that is good about looking into what you want to do before high school is the collages as well. Some collages might have the the class you need to finish and major in what you are studying for. It is like a head start on one the classes you take in high school, two the rest of your high school years, three the collage you want to get into. But there are always some downs to thinking and or knowing what you want to do before you even get to high school. Such as there might not be a class for what you want to major in. Or you might not be eligible for taking that class , they could be over booked in those classes. There might be mix ups with your schedule that may cause you not to get the class you wanted. Even when you have your mind set on one thing for your future your opinion may change over time it may even change completely. And it happens to a lot of students. They make up there minds and then maybe weeks later it may change into something else. There are also other issues with what you want to do in your future. Some students work full time jobs and its hard for those students to focus on one goal and keep up with school work , Sometimes even miss school just because of work. If you think about it even after graduating high school some still work and move on to collage and are still stuck in the mud with work and even harder homework and class work. So dont have a ride to school or even work. Money is a big issue as well. With having to pay for a car or even other life needs you might not be able to get into the collage you want to get into because of how expensive it is. There are student loans but you still have to pay that back and sometimes you can be late on payments but then that doubles and no one wants that. High school is where your future really begins really. Because if you think about it is where you start learning about where to get your start , how to start , when to start . This is where we as students decide what we want to do in life and where we want to go with it . And if we chose to chance our dream that thats where we end p with hard work and dedication.

399,1963,C85795794D51,"Forty-five percent of people in the world enjoy doing outdoor activities. Something like going to community parks, state parks, and even national parks. The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park. Some interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park. Away that I would spend my time outdoors is hanging out with family and friends. By doing that I can go to the zoo with friends or go to a park and play sports with them. There are many thing you can do you just have to find the right activity the you like and enjoy. Another activity that I enjoy is playing soccer with my dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing. These activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. People can use these activities to take their minds off certain situation like problem at home or something going on at school . People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors. I think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away. everyone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining. In conclusion, there are many enjoyable things to do outdoors you just have to find the right activity that suites you or maybe even try new things do to by yourself or find someone to do it with.

400,1964,2F7B0CE01B4B,"People who take decisions with guidance from experts and authorities have a higher chance of making a correct decision then others, although many prefer going with his or her own instinct or idea. Seeking guidance helps to see from a different perspective, which could allow for a better choice to be made. At some point and time we all need advice from someone who is experience or would like to know what is there perspective of another person, even though may think that they need to make decisions themselves without anyones advice or opinion. Taking decisions is a tough thing to do in general, but seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help you make this decision with less frustration or confusion. For example, we seek advice on a daily base from our teachers, following our parents foot steps, but we rely on our own thoughts, we listen to our elder closely because they have more experience. People who lose sight of seeking guidance usually end up making a wrong or bad decision. Most people tend not to think about the cause of what made this decision come back or the effect it can have on others. As for, Someone who seeks guidance it is likely that they have gone through the same situation or something like your situation and can help you make a decision that can help you but also consider the effect it may have on others. As a result, with the advice of someone whom is more experience can bring a positive outcome. Decisions are made on a daily bases from when people get up to when they go to sleep. For example, If someone has to take a decision some may fall into pressure and that led to take a decision that may not be the best and can have a negative outcome. When asking someone with experience there can be various ways or choices given to or ways to approve the situation. They can also give feedback on a decision someone was planning to take that could work out but also, could have been something that effected the person who was making the decision. As a result, If the person who was making the decision had not gone to get feedback or advice the choice of the decision could have been a decision that made to another decision allowing the decision process to be repeated and stay with a negative effect until that person has asked for advice from someone with experience. People who make their own decision get ready for life guidance could help in difficult times, although they think that It Is smart just going with the idea or instinct they have it is also a good thing to ask for someone opinion or advice. Because, they may not being seeing the bigger picture or maybe they are not seeing the pros and cons or the decision they are going to take. Asking for advice is also another way to assure that what you are going to do Is right. Therefore, whenever taking a decision it is best to ask someone for advice because it is likely they have gone through the same thing that someone is going through.

Im definitely argue with Ralph Waldo Emersons statement about individuality because your own style of works,Nobody tell us what to change , freely to choose your way of thinking. First, your own style of works. For example, my dear sister "" Generic_Name"" yesterday, she got a phone call. I was with her, when she answered the phone call , its was the teacher saying if my sister "" Generic_Name "" would come at her college, because she was the only one at her class to got a higher score for doing the project with her own creativity and unique steps at the project without following the steps that her teacher being teaching daily at the whole classroom. The teacher told my sister its a good way to do something with your own ideas without the fear that would be good or bad its just exploring your ability to making great works being yourself .This explain my sister for being the only one to did the project with her own way got the most higher grade. Second, Nobody tell us what to change. For example, my sister "" Generic_Name"", every night, she tell me, how I need to brush my hair correctly, she thinks the hair need a proper care and treatment to brushing the hair . I dont like to do at her way because I feel her way to brush its more slowly than mine own way to brush my hair, so every night she got mad with me because never use her style to brush the hair. I always said to her, I like to brush my hair at my way and my sister can not tell me to change my way at brushing my beautiful hair. This explain, my sister, dont need to get mad for doing the opposite the she wants to do, I got my style and nobody has to tell me what to change at doing any activity. Third, Freely to choose your way of thinking. for examples. ""Generic_Name "" my sister told to my mom , if she can participate at the "" project of making a novel "" in her school , so my mom let to her participate. She thinks that would be the winner for being the most iconic novel might be existed in the world, so she starting to writing it down, each content at her novel but she dont need a examples of novel because she got her own style to write down, she say her novel would be a entertainment novel because her way to thinks its different at the other types of novels, her novel will be a her own creativity and passion to make the novel the next most read novel in the world. This explain,free thinking its discovering a new person. Individuality, makes us special to achieve it goals. style of works different than anyone else. we dont need to someone to tell us what to change. Being free to choosing thoughts it s s a perfect way to express it with the real world .some says individuality is to be a selfish behavior for doing the things at ours own ways but Individuality its just a sense of life to find your own way to work.

402,1966,FE8BA4043788,"Is it true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life?. Well, success is a strong word, there are some people that do not get where they want to be because the way they think. Our actions depend on how our thinking is. It is true that a positive attitude is a key to success in life, if you have a goal and you really work hard to achieve it , you are always thinking ""I can do it"" and you are being positive about it, you have the idea that you will get whatever you want to get. In addition there are many people who really want to get something or get to somewhere, but their minds are always thinking negative, they feel like they will not do good or they will not success, it makes them not keep trying. For example, when I was in middle school I had a classmate who will always think he was a ""looser"" he will always said that he could not do anything, his parents did not love him, so many horrible things that will make feel sad, I always tried to make him feel better by saying positive things about him, but I thing that is all about the ideas we put in our minds. Success depends on our actions too,sometimes we let other people decide for us, we either do what they said or we act the same way they act. Some of this people do not have a positive attitude to help you success. we create a plan that we have to work on to be successful, even though that we need to have a positive attitude. We have to make it happen no matter what, try as hard as you can! because if you just have a positive attitude but you are not trying hard an off, is not worth it, I seemed some people that are very good at something because thats all and the only thing they do :However they dont try to keep going further, and when they are in a situation that things are more challenging they give up!

403,1967,9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldnt do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you arent benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives. One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well. A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that wont be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I dont make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesnt come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there wont be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well. One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people dont seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well. In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyones day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.

In my opinion I think it would be bad for them If teenagers stay until after 10 p. m and not having a curfew, so it is good for them to have it because of these three examples. If this was a law I think it would be good for them to have the curfew because they will have a time limit and theyll know what time to not go outside, because if the stay outside until after 10 p. m they are basically breaking the law. I think it will be good for them because if they dont have it it will interfere their lives and their life schedule. And it will make them and keep them unorganized about everything. Because they cant sleep well, they wont have enough energy to keep up with their daily works. In my opinion it will be good for them to have it because, it would be more safe for them and they will be more safe and it will keep them away from danger and trouble.

The first reason why I dissagree with this statement is because we can not judge on other people from the first sight. Meeting someone and talking to them dose not mean that you know them yet. Some people treat others with different way. For example, if you are close to me and we know each other for long time, I will treat you different than a person who I just met. The second reason why I dissagree with this statment is because we do not know what other people going through. If you met a person for the first time and this person was rude or aggressive, there should be a reason for this behaviour. Maybe the person had a bad day or perhaps he is going through rough situations. You should think about what you are going to do if you were in the same position. That is why I dissagree with the statement.

411,1975,5985EA6F171A,"I think is a good idea that the students start thinking about what they want to study in the college, what they want to be in the life, and they start preparing for the future in the high school. It is a good idea because they can start working when they are really young, It is a good idea too because they can make money when they are young, It is a good idea because they can buy they own things with their own money, like a house, a car, or whatever they want, and they can get graduate really young and that is the way to prepare you for something. For example you can stop living with your family you can be indepent, nobody can tell you anything you can rent your own room just for you and you can have your own space, another example is that you are young maybe you make a wrong decision in the career that you choose but the good option is that you are young you already did the high school maybe you already work so you have money you can start another career more important something that these time you already liked because you are more older you know more about what you really want. Also in the work that you have you can study a little bit more and you can scale to another position too much better when you are young youre body dont feel so tired when you work because you have more energy, but when you are more older your body start feel tired, you start loose energy the sickness come your body hurt you have to go more to the doctor, so when you are young you can work more for you retirement. In conclusion is a good idea that the students start commit a career at a young age because that are going to help them to be someone in the life, also that are gonna help them to be an important person. But the more important is that you are going to work in what do you love to do. The benefit of start preparing for a career since the high school is that you are going to be a young with a lot experience, also that help to the young students stop thinking on bad things, like cigar, tobacco, alcohol etc. Also help them keep their mind busy and to be in high school and not in the streets with bad friends that help them to keep a educational way. And is something that they are going to use in the life and is something that is good, what we need now is a societies based on education because that is a good thing because the education come with a lot of opportunities and with that opportunities the students can lear a lot, the learning is the best thing on the world.",5,5,5,5,5,5,1158,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

My name is Generic_Name. I attend Generic_School and i am a student athlete,i play soccer and football and based on my experience in these sports i agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. I have three main reasons why i agree Author Emerson,and the first reason is to get better at what you are doing you have to take bigger steps. In order for me to get better at football and soccer, i have to try to do something beyond what i used to do. I take personal Fitness in school and my goal is to get stronger, but i cannot get stronger if i keep on lifting the same weights i can not i get stronger if am always benching the same weight. My second reason is that, it helps you win a race or in other words it can help you win a compettion. It is just like Uber competing with lyft, they both good at what they do but in order for uber to gain more customers they have to try to do something that is beyond what they have mastered. I play as a striker in soccer and i play as conerback in football but am not the only striker on the socccer team and am not the only cornerback on the football team so in order for me to start on the team i have to work harder than i used to. My third reason is it will help you be successful in life. I just found out that the owner of Amazon started in a garage,when i first heard i told myself that he wouldnt be successful if did not take bigger steps in life and even though he is successful he is still taking bigger steps. Also, Trump had everything he wanted cars,money, houses but still wanted to compete with Clinton for the presidency. Lets use an iphone for instance,the more they keep on upgrading it the more they gain more customers. A lot of successful entrepreneurs took bigger steps by getting a loan to start their business. Some people will say you dont have to try to do something beyond what you have mastered,you just have to try to do new things but trying new things does not help you grow because how is adding another workout to my old workout making me stronger?,I have to increase the weight to make me stronger or how am i gaining more customers or how am i growing or how is my business growing if am still working from a garage?, in order for my business to grow or for me to gain more customers i have to take some bigger steps like getting loan to find a new place.

Some people think that working in groups helps them be more productive and helps them get the job done easier. There could be teachers who wouldnt support the idea of working in groups. If youre trying to convince your teacher you have to have examples to support your position. Working in a group is more productive and easier it gets the job done quicker then you expect. You can assign each classmate your working with a job duty. One of each classmate can work in drawing, writing, searching up facts about the assignment and not least but last the leader to put everything together and help his classmates when needed. There can be minor things when working in groups. You could expect some who would do there job and just take advantage of time and not be productive. The leader is expected to get there classmates to work and not waste time. When working alone instead of in groups there can be advantages. Like Having more time in the assignment and not rushing into it. You can have your own ideas without others forcing you to change it up into something they all like. When it comes to mistakes you can point them out yourself and correct them. Instead of stressing about who is not working and who cant get the job done you can work on your own. There could be problems too like not having enough time and cant get your job done as quick as you need it to be. There is other classes to worry about. Some teachers wouldnt support the idea of working i groups. Instead they would like for you to work alone to get your job done easier. But not every student would support that idea of working alone. Some students could be left back and behind from class so they would need the help from his classmates. There is supporting ideas on why it would be so much better in groups and it would be to get the job done easier and faster. Being alone isnt very helpful when you need the help you do. Working in groups would not just help students but teachers on grading your work. It can be stressful for them when it comes to working alone and having so much papers to grade. The idea of working with other students would be much more easier and productive. It would feel way better for you and other classmates.

414,1978,163AC455E1DF,"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing.

A lot of times people say an example to make you know what would happen if you continue doing it. But, is the example the best way to influence people? Yes, an example will make you know that you are doing something bad, it will let you know what are the consequences of it, and you know that the example influence others, because you can see that your parents are the most important example in your life; they are going to make you as a person. When you are doing something bad and the people see it, they will probably tell you an example of something that you are doing something bad or innapropiate; for example, when you are climbing a tree, your mom would tell you stop doing that, your sister broke her arm because she was climbing that tree, that is going to make you think if you are doing something good or bad. It is going to make you know that people are telling this to you, because they dont want you to have bad consequences. Another example would be that when you are drinking, somebody would tell you dont think to drive, because my uncle died because he was drunk and he had a car accident,so you will know that people are advising you, because they know that you are doing something bad. When people tell you a good example to stop doing something, it will make you know that you are doing something bad. A lot of times you are doing something, and you dont know the consequences of your action, maybe, it can break your arm, or it can send you to the hospital; but when people tell you an example it will let you know the actions; for example, if you are listening to music very loud, you couldnt know that it can make your ears very bad, but when people tell you turn the music down, my sisters ears are very bad because she was listening to music very loud; after that you know that you better stop doing that, because it will bring you very bad consequences, and you do not want that, so you would stop. Another thing, is that knowing the consequences of your actions, could help another people; for example, if you are drinking you should know that you can not drive, if you do not drive another person will not die, because you know that you can have a car accident, and that is because people told you an example of what is going to happen if you drive while you are drunk. An example can help you to know the consequences of your actions. A lot of people say that you are who you are because of your parents, and that is right, your parents are the most important example for you. They are going to tell you what is good and what is wrong; your parents influence you because they are your most important example, and that is what an example does, influence you, tells you what is good and what is wrong; for example, if your parents are good people, you should be a good person, but if your parents do not care about you, they do not listen to you or they treat people bad, you are going to be somebody who doesn;t listen to people, you will not care about anyone, so your parents are your most important example, because they have taught you what is good and what is wrong; and you can see again that the example influences you. The parents are your most important example and influence. We saw that an example can make us think what is good and what is wrong, it is going to tell us the consequences of our actions, it will make you think that you are doing something bad, and we can see that the example influences you because we have our parents, we are going to be the same as them, because they are the people that is going to teach us how to act.

Technology has increased the rates of kidnapping, human trafficking ,sexual abuse ,and murder. Due to technology we are also losing our eye sight. It has also limited our communication skills . Young adults usually download dating apps to meet new people ,but they dont understand the risk they can get them self into. For example they usually meet someone online and start talking. After awhile the guy probably ask her out on a date to go for a dinner ,and of course the girl is going to say yes because shes interest in the guy. Few days later the guy ask her out on another date to go and watch a movie ,but he says that hes going to pick her up; and that were it all start she get in the car thinking he going to take her to the movies ,but instead hes taking her somewhere else hes going to kidnapping her and she doesnt know. she goes missing for weeks and no one knows where shes at. A few days later they find her body dead. Now in day more and more people are using glasses. Technology is ruining our eye vision. People that work in offices are more likely to be using glasses now in day. They sit all day looking that their computer ,but they dont realize that their eye sight is getting bad. Young adults are also using glasses too because they use their phone to much or watch to much TV . One way to prevent that is you could put your light dimer on your computer and phone. You could also set your self a limit for how long youre going to use your phone or computer. Another reason why technology is bad because it limits our communication skills. More people are getting used to working independently. Teacher will usually give us a project assignment; we can either work with a partner or work independently. Most students like to work independently because they dont like to rely on someone else finishing the part they had to work on for the project and not doing it. We are also able to text or video chat with other people instead of talking to them in person. By talking to someone in person it can also increase your self esteem. In conclusion these are my reason why I believe that technology is not good for us. Technology has impacted us a lot in society.

If not, here are some of the benefits, why some students choose to attend classes in their home, by the way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, its more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others. Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school cant be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they dont want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, its more safer for them to study. For example in todays society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others. Like for example, some of the school are diverse ethnic, students characteristics are diverse also, like some of the other likes to go shopping mall, likes to strolling anywhere, likes to bully others, likes to fight, likes to not go home after school instead go to other houses that they dont really even that much know, and many more characteristics. Although students will have benefits of attending classes from school, however, attending classes from home has much more benefits.

Doing community service it could also be fun it doesnt have to always be boring it could be fun because if they send you to places that you have to be with a lot of people you could be with your friend when you are doing community service like helping a teacher the teacher might need to helpers so you can ask your friend if he/she wants to go with you so you could not be by your self. community service it is also good because the way you are not always in your house trying to figure out what are you going to do because your bored or you will not be just laying down in the bed or in the sofa playing video games or watching a movie because over time that will get boring for you and it will affect your healthy so thats why its good to do community service even ones a week or in a month its not bad to do community service I do community service all Sundays and sometimes over the weekend it is so fun to do community service because i spend some times with my friends with out going to the mall or anything like that so it will be good for other student to do some community services so they can see that it is not boring to do them. so i will like to tell you principal that you should put students to do community services so they could see how good and fun it is . i will like to say that is fun to do because sometimes you are like what should i do today or what i am going to do tomorrow and you get so stress that you dont even know what to do so sometimes when you are like that and you have to do community service it would not be that hard for you to stress. you can also help your mom doing something it would be good for her to you be helping here to your dad to because sometimes your dad its tired of working and he will ask your help so you could help him and that will also can be community service because your helping your parents so thats why i thing you should put student to do the community service. sincerely, STUDENT_NAME",7,6,8,6,6,8,200,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

We shouldnt do that to other people because it was great for you, let them decide on what path theyre going to take. We should only give them advice, but dont decide for them. Make a good character of yourself, dont let anyone make you feel down. We are the ones to decide our own path of happiness. We can be many things if you believe that you can achieve it. If you think that this is a better way to a good character, then take it, endure it, make it worth it. In conclusion, we should choose our own character traits. You might say, ""I think peoples influences can be good for our character."" you are not wrong, but not all influence can be good for your character. It is what John Lubbock said, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" It means that you are the one to take control of your own character.

423,1987,BFEA2E7F1486,"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment because at the day of today theres a lot people that doesnt want to accept the way that you are or you want to be. They will never be satisfied, they will judge you, they will talk bad things about you, but at the end its just a obstacle that the life put in your way, so you can surpass it and finally find yourself and be how you are. To be yourself in this actual world its difficult for some people because sometimes they dont support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language. To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you dont make people accept the way that you are. For teenagers to be theirselves is most difficult because they are in a young age and sometimes they dont really know how they are or how they want to be, and when they finally find it, the hard part is coming. Then for older people, most of them dont care what people say about them, I have seen a lot of older people that dress and make to their selves what they want and I really like to see them because it makes me to be less insecure about myself, they just make me think a lot. Live the life by showing how you are, the opinion of other people doesnt have to make you more insecure or make you think that if you do this or other things you will get judged or hated. You have to fight to achieve this because life is better if you do it, is better if you dont care about others comments, you will be more stronger than before if you fight with all this situations. You will be more happy and will have a great life if you are yourself, you will be more certain about your opinions, decisions and actions. You can help other people to achieve this goal that is ""To be yourself"" because sometimes there is people that need from others to make a change in their life. If you help them and they accept your help, they will be thankful to you because you help them a lot and you was with them, when nobody wasnt. At the end of your days you will be really thankful to you because you live life the way that you are, not the way that others wanted you to be. You will think in all the things that you have to supported and achieved just to get your goal, to be who you are and at end you will knew that it wasnt hard. It was just obstacles that maked your life more stressful and harder but you did it.

424,1988,52F9582F9C86,"Every student should have the opportunity to be involved in extracurricular activities for them to enrich their educational experiences. Here are some reasons why they should be involved in activities, when theyre involved in activities they have the opportunity to do different kind of stuff outside home, school, and even work. They also learn how to be independent and responsible. Also being in extracurricular activities could also help the students health. First, when students are involved in activities outside school and home, it gives them the chance to experience different things outside school, home, or even work. They learn different kind of things. Things they wouldnt learn in school. For example during school they learn about math, science, history, and english. When theyre home they do nothing but homework and help around the house some students have to work. If theyre involved in activities, they have the opportunity to experience different kind of stuff for example: if a student decided to do a sport they would learn about that certain sport and they would also play it and enjoy it with a team. If they play a sport they would have to also practice at home, but not verse others or be in a team to practice with. Second, students learn how to be more independent when involved in activities. For example, when I decided to join figure skating I wasnt independent, I didnt really know how to do things by myself, and when I joined at first it was kind of hard because I needed help with everything but as time passed by I started to learn how to be more dependent. I started doing almost everything by myself without any help, I was more dependent at home, school, and figured skating. Being involved in this activity, also taught me how to be more responsible. When doing activities you need to learn how to use your time wisely because you will need time for school, homework, family, and the activity youre involved in. Being involved in an activity is a good way to learn how to be responsible, how to be independent, and how to manage your time wisely. Last, joining an activity can help with your mental and physical health specially if its a sport. Joining an activity is a good way to distract yourself from school, home, or work. This is because you will be thinking about the rules of the activity or about the point of that certain activity. It also helps your physical help meaning that it helps you exercise and it helps your body do what it needs to do. Being involved in a sport is a good way to help you exercise and distract yourself from other things. Being involved in activities such as sports or school clubs allows you to enjoy that time. If its something you really like then its something you can look forward to after having a bad day or a stressful day. When I had a bad day I would always think about skating and what I should do to make my jumps better. I would also go to the skating ring and practice, this helped me be more active and helped my physical health too. Being involved in a sport or any other activities is a good way to help students look forward for things. Some people may argue that schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because some students dont have time to do school assignments but that shouldnt be their problem, that would be the students problem because students should know that if they join more than one activity they will still need to do school assignments such as homework or projects. Students should learn how to manage their time and use it wisely. Students and families should control the student involvement in extracurricular activities.",8,7,8,8,8,7,1085,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
425,1989,D159EE3218BC,"Showing kindness to others is very important because people see you that you have a kind soul, people can spread kindness around the world, and kindness will help you throughout your future. Kindness is the key for success and enjoying your life. The world would not been the same if their were not any kindness, imagine what it would be like if no one knew what kindness is. Having kindness in your blood could change your future to an even better one. Having no kindness means that you are negative and misrable but all that could change when a person shows you how kindness could change your personality. When people see you showing kindness, that shows that you have a good heart and a good soul. And, it also shows that you care and very nice so, people could trust you. Thinking kindness is very positive and relaxing because it is a very good thing to do in life. Kindness will never be a bad thing because it is meant to change the future. No matter what, kindness could never go wrong as long as you try it to others. Spreading kindness around the world could change how people think, in terms of doing something bad is not part of kindness. Therefore, giving kindness to a person could spread around the world, and you would not even know that all this kindness was because of you. Without kindness, all the virture words would not even exsist. There would be no such things as being caring, loving, sharing, humble, and so much more. Every small kindness you show to others, will change their emotion and follow your action as they did to you. Kindness will really help you in the future because it shows you who you truly are. If you show kindness everywhere then their could be a chance for you to get into jobs easily or, for you to get good grades on your school work. Also, in the future you would be very grateful that kindness brought you here into this amazing life, and all the kindness you have done in your previous years. Kindness is always by your side. You will appreciate having kindness in your life because it helps you to become a better person. Kindness will not randomly appear to you, you just need to make and share kindness. Life is waiting patiently for the people to spread kindness everywhere but, unfortunatly some people would not let that happen. In our expectation people should already have kindness for, in reality thousands of people do not want to share their kindness. Some people are trying to spread kindness because they want the world to be a good place for the future.

426,1990,ABBE700093F0,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10 p. m. weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is adopted, teenagers on the streets after those hours would be breaking the law. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives? Curfew helps young kids to stay out of trouble because it can be dangerous. For example, if they just wording around at night they dont know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think its cool but in reality its not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you. Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends aint gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you cant see in the dark and you dont know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also. Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they wont get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that aint gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew. Plus it the matter of respect for your parents. Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens dont think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dontt know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DONT GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND!

428,1992,31EEF9A4A29B,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students will benefit more from distance learning than from going to school. Not everyone agrees that going school is for them. Distance learning is gives a better chance to learn all your education. Here are a couple reasons why I support the idea of distance learning. First, reason why I think that distance learning is more beneficial to you is because you can manage your time better with class work and classes. You have the opportunity to work on your own schedule. Separate the classes throughout the day instead of all bunched up at once. More time for you to focus on either classes you kind of struggle with or classes most important. All work does not have to have a due date or time limit. You can take your time to understand the material at hand and do all your work when capable. Secondly, the more comfortable the environment the better you work. Schools environment isnt so good for students, sometimes we sit in classes where its hard to learn. Hard to learn because a lot of kids do not take there work serious, stay off task, and distract others from learning. That harms the learning environment makes kids get a little frustrated at times with there work. Its not easy to do your work while not being able to concentrate correctly and being distracted. When you are in a comfortable environment, work is not so complicated. You can relax, think straight, and focus on the task at hand with no problems. Being able to attend class from home keeps you away from the bad environment. Last but not least, the safety of the students is always important. While in school kids can be harmed in different type of ways. Some get bullied others get into altercations. This is hard to stay away from because you are in school and it surrounds you. This can definitely throw off a student and get them off track. When kids start to think about many other problems instead of there school work it is not good. Attending your classes at home, online, or through video conference is the safest way to attend. You wouldnt have to worry about the school drama or the bullies. Your mind will be strictly focused on the work you have to do and nothing less. In conclusion, the idea of students attending classes from home, video conference, or online. Is most beneficial because of there safety, work environment, and schedule. I agree with my reasoning and support them to the max because distance learning is the best way to learn. Your student should give distance learning a chance its worth it. ",8,7,7,7,7,7,648,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

In life if your attitude is pleasant you will have a lot of opportunities, and also be succesful in work, love, and friends. For example if you help your partners in work, and do your work well probable your boss prometed you in a better stand for all your effort and devotion. Another example can be in love if you are affectionate, charismatic, and loving probably you gonna find someone love you and give you the same love, and actitud you have with her. To begin with, the best way to get a best position in your work is to show a good attitude. The majority of contrators like someone everyone loves too, because is more effective to everyone and effective for the company. For example last year in my uncle work someone will be ascent, 3 workers inclued my uncle, the most part vote for him because they said is the most friendly, and the most appropiate for the jod. To conclude this if your attitude like the others everyone wiil be agree with you and they going to follow you because they trust you. Secondly, the best manner to be in love with your partner is havening a great attitude, and communication. The most part of relationship work, because both respect each other, and have a great communication. For example my Mom and my Dad never fighting they prefer talk and solve them problems and teach me how is not necessary have a load attitude to solve a problem. This show how have a good attitude is the best way to prevent the love gone and preven divorces. Some people say, is not always neccesary have a good actitud to be succesful in life. A lot porcent of people think have a bad attitude is a caracteristic to be succesful and is not a obstacle to have a great career in the future. For example the president of my country his attitude is disagreeable but he has a faultless career and although he is likeable is the president of El Salvador. However everyday people say he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us. This demostrate how you can have a good career or power, but if your attitude is unpleasant although they need it never gonna like you. People with good personality and good attitude have the benefit to get everything more easy for how you expresed to others. And people who have a weird attitude no matter what they said if they sttil have that attitude and dont chance people never gonna try have a friendship with them for this reasons.

I see alot of people like at resturants using there phones while eating and no one talking to each other. I see a lot of kids using phones while eating like playing games or watching movies on there technology. A lot of parents get mad at there children because they use there phone all day and they cant have at least 30 minutes to talk. I see a lot pf people posting pictures on social media. I know people posting pictures on social media all day. Theres a lot of people that take pictures and videos what they do in there lives. I think technology made use worst because we cant live without looking at social meia at least once a day. I think people should go out and have fun with friends or family or finding a job so you will be too busy to think about your phone or technology. If your busy or doing something you wont tgink about your phone or technologies. A lot of people like to stay home and use technology all day at home and i think thats not good. Its nice going out with friends or family having a good time without using technology. The time goes faster when your are busy or doing something but if you use your phone it eems the time goes slower. I thik sometimes technology could be good use. I think it would be good because you can read books and search up anything you need .Technology is good when we use it in school because its easier to do our work. If you need to build or anything or need anything you can search it up on your technology and it will show you how to do it. I only use my phone for Maps, Music, and to search up things i need to know. I dont like using my phone to be on social media all day i work so i use my phone for work not to be on social media all day. If you need to do homework and find the answer you can search it up on your technology. I think technology is good when you need something important to do on it.

436,2000,92E97E947628,Dear Principle i have herd that you are deciding whether all students should perform in the community service. I think it will be a great idea for our school and for our community. This will be able to help people know that if we do are work together as a group we will accomplish more work and that not just one man can do everything but if we are united we will succeeds. By doing all of this it will be able to make are town cleaner and let people know that we care about this town. By the way this will be a great opportunity for our community to be clean so if different people who comes from different places will make good judgement about are community and maybe they might tell their friends how they think about it.

437,2001,E80C88E9837C,"I agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. All the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them. I agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. My family came of a poor family, but I have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. One failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success. I agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couches that saw him, dont believe him they say like he doesnt has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that dont believe him that they was wrong. Because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success. I agree with Mister Churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. I am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but I keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that I have to work for pay may rent and buy my own stuff, shoes, clothes, and food, it make more dificult to have my success, but I know that success consists on fall apart and wake up, but I never loss my enthusiasm of to be graduate from high school. One day I gonna say that my success wasnt easy but I obtain a good success. In Conclution I agree with ""churchills statement about success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him because on the way to a great success we gonna have many failure but we donthave to loss our enthusiasm, because in the world there is a lot people that they never loss their enthusiasm, even when they have a failure they always weke up and keek going, now they have a good success, so if we want a great success in our life we have to keep going wrestlering with all the failure that we gonna have. One day we gonna say I made it and we gonna have a great success. ",6,5,5,4,5,5,3357,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects. Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student . Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good. Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .",5,5,6,4,6,6,1706,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

441,2005,FFCDB2524616,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emersons "" To be yourself in a world that os constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" because, in this generation kids are trying to fit in with other kids, by changing the way that they speak or the way they dress. Kids also try to fit in by doing what other people tell them to do, making dumb decisions that could potentially end you up in jail or possibly something even worse effecting their future all because they wanted to fit in. Peer pressure is a main factor in kids that are trying to fit in. Kids pressure other kids into making poor decisions when in reality they dont wanna do it but they wanna look cool infront of others kids so they do it anyways. In reality it isnt cool to do what people tell you to do especially when its just to fit in with others. In my opinion people shouldnt make poor decisions trying to fit in with the others, you should be yourself, it doesnt matter where you from or what type of clothes your wearing everyone should be accepted no matter who they are. Kids should be leaders not followers, you can end up with the wrong friends that could care less about you, but are only with you because you make the poor decisions theyre telling you to make.

442,2006,C7BD62EA392F,"Dear Principal: I personally dont think its a good idea that your considering changing school policy so that people may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average. Sports has nothing no do with school, thats just another activity thats after school and the better you play sports the better your going to be good at school, specially with your grades. It keeps you organized and makes you stay on topic. For people sports are really important and really fun to play, it makes you runs and concentrated on how you play. You might think that for some reason thats why people are getting a bad grade average, but its not like that. I consider that sports are really important to me, and even if i dont play in a team i still love to play any kind of sport. It keeps me awake and motivated. It keeps me from stop being lazy all the time. There are 2 main reasons why i dont think its a good idea that you should change that policy. My first main reason is sports have nothing to do with school ,is just another amazing activity that people would enjoy instead of just watching TV or being on the computer. My second reason is like my mom always told me a story. When she was little and lived back in Mexico, she would tell me all about her childhood and what she would do at my age. She used to tell me that she would run every morning to exercise and breath the fresh air outside, after that she would be with my grandfather and helping him with everything that she could and then she would play Basketball with her friends. Having a little challenge to see who would win and just to have fun. I remember asking her if sports had to do anything with school? if that was an activity to bring my grades up ? What she said Exactly was "" They invented sports so that kids, teenagers and people would have a routine and be a better person. Believe it or not mostly for teenagers, sports brings there grade up and well organized , and when i started playing sports, it did bring my grade up. What the captains do is that they show you how to be on time and do all your assignments so its similar to sports. Ill never forget the message that my mom gave me about sports.

443,2007,06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one persons advice Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one persons for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. Its kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one persons advice. Having connections The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. Thats either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldnt be so great. Help in the future Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, lets say you didnt know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a persons advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember. More than one persons advice Last but not least, why more than one persons advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasnt being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they havent been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults. Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Dont be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesnt need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice. Therefore, the reason that we ask advice is to become someone better each day by taking that advice.",8,8,7,9,9,7,94,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
444,2008,6586DF43A92D,"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments. Trying hard and keep tryin till you reach success helps us to keep our enthusiasim. Being successful in school well help us in our daily life. We will go from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiasim. We know that by being successful in school we are going to have many opportunities in life. Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying. Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you. Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim. Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying. Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed. Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim.

They think that sometimes students take too many extracurricular activities to the point that they do not have enough time to do their school work. They feel that extracurricular activities dont help students manage their time wisely. I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Firstly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to manage their time. It helps students learn how to manage their time by making them make a schedule. By making a schedule students learn how hard it is to an adult. Students make resposible actions and learn how much work they have to put in for them to be good in school. Extracurricular activities doesnt always take studenst time but prepares them for life Secondly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to make new friends. Extracurricular activities helps students how to communicate and make new friends while making good memories. Students shouldnt always be focused in school I believe that students should also have fun and friends. Friends will make school and other school related activities enjoyable for kids and teengers. Lastly extracurricular activities helps students make colleges be interested in them. Colleges get interested in you when they see all of the thinggs youve done althrought high school. If colleges see that youve a lot throught high school they would be even more interested in you. Colleges also check your grades and other stuff but the thing they check the most is extracurricular activities because they want to see if you were consistant. As you have read I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them.

To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesnt understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesnt talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better. People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didnt know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasnt good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he wouldt get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesnt have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes. The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world wouldn be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesnt know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they dont have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they dont even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as its today, everything would be in peace. In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way.

450,2014,05F30981F3EB,"Imagine if online schooling was offered at every school. Schools are offering online classes for students to attend class. Also schools offer video conferencing online to help benefit at home. This is important because some students are not responsible to get to school on time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, students would not have to stress over transportation. Certainly some might think staying in the house all day causes bordom to do school work. Others believe students tend to need help from an adult to understand that content. Still others argue by feeling alone will not motivate them to be productive. To begin with, health issues play a major role through out the school year on students. Students always tend to come to school while they are sick. So that spead germs through out the school and causes major illness. Spreading germs can have someone hospitalized and in bad condition. Which can make students have bad attendince. Also parents would loose jobs to attend to their sick child. However staying home and still be able to do your school work causes less stress. Because it gives student more time to be able to complete there assignments. Another reason way online classes will help out students that are in wheel chairs, crutches, and broken legs. Is they dont have to be rushed, pushed, in the crowded halls. Therefore they feel more safe and have enough space at home. Parents will be able to supervise their child more. An not be worried that something else might happen. Health issues should be a cause of not being able to not attend school if you are able to do it from home. Secondly students become smarter doing the research on their own to retain the information. Every student have a diffent way to learn. Some students need days to understand the content. An some can understand the content off the first try. Also some student need to see it hands on then be supervised as they complete the task. Witch is also not a bad way to retain information. If help is needed the video conferencing will help out in the long run. Being able to home relax and still manage to completed your school work motivates the student to remain on task. Another reason why is grades will have a major increase and students would maintain a higher grade point average. The best part of the video conferencing is the student will be able to replay it if needed. Instead of hearig it once in class from a teacher then forgetting the information the next time you have that subject. Apart of life that is important to have is knowledge, so being able to teach and perfect your weakness are important. Lastly transportation is a mojor problem for students. Some students have to walk, get droped off, or take the bus to get to school on time. Most students are not responsible to wake up on time to catch the bus. The students that walk are stessed, because they have to walk while its raining, hot, ride their bike, cold, and dark. In conditions like that are not safe for students to go through is something happend to them. Most of the time parents have to work and be worried that their child get to school safe. Having the privaledge to be home and do work will prevent fights, childish students, and angery teachers. So everyone would have peace and respect for one another and learn more. There will be no disagreement and aultications with students and teachers. After school students will not have to rely on transperations, because they are already home. Less stress can be taken off of adukts that are nor responsible for you. Having to find transpertation to your destination is worth money and not everyone is forchen to loan out money all the time. Students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because health issues play a major role through out the school year, students can become smarter by taking time to learn the content, and students would not have to stress over transportation. If students was able to stay home and do school work the it would be less confusion in school. Keep calm and remain focus even if times get hard on your shoulders.

Some people value self reliance and feel the need to follow their own instincts and ideas. Although these people are confident and trust themselves,I believe people should ask for advice from their parents and other professionals before making important life decisions. First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents. They help me look at both the good and bad things about different job. They bring up things that I may have not thought about. Their advice help me make better decisions. I appreciate their knowledge because they know me very well and want the best for me. Therefor, I thing It is important to ask for their guidance in these matters. Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education. For instance, after I graduate from high school and earn my diploma I will ask my teacher about the possibility of going to a community college or taking extra classes to help me get a good job that will make me happy and provide me with skills make so that I can live a better life. My teacher have worked hard with me to provide me with guidance and the skills I need to be smart in life.

Simple, not everybody has the same capacity, as somebody said ""we can not judge a fish by his ability to claim a tree"", we must motive the student to take the class that he/she wants and they will give their best. thanks for the attention, in addition, I hope that the principal could take a smart choice and leave the classes electives.",6,5,7,7,7,6,3260,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

When people are searching for advice they usually ask more than one person, I think thats best, because you can see from different points of views. I think only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new.

456,2020,EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arnt in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student? The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosent feel like doing it. Students who dont do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arnt distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isnt. Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they dont get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isnt capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial? Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers. Students have their own way of learning, it doesnt matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesnt matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you.

Students would have more time to do work and finish their assiments with the two extra hours of school. Students with low grades can get more help if its needed for them. Teachers wouldnt have to stay after school if there are two more hours of school. Students would learn more with the time they have to show the students. Students would have an extra day of no school, so they can rest up. The students would have more time to be with there family.

If you think about it the people you wach on tv or any of the people you think are successesful hade to have strugled in life to get to the place they are now.

459,2023,CB2F9A2B612B,"I would play basketball for the school because you get to play against other teams in other different schools. Also, your friends can watch you play. Playing basketball for the school is a good thing,for an example:Your getting sponsored,you get to participate in activities like drills,and you get to play against teams from other county schools. If you make it to the basketball team you have to be healthy because high school is different how you play from different other leagues and also you have to work out alot to get in a good shape so you can have a higher advantage on driving a lane or shooting a three on you opponents while playing basketball. One important thing is that you gotta listen to your coach and have good sportsmanship because if you do,then you will have a perfect team to win the championship game because if you do good college coaches might scout and look for good players that knows how to handle the ball and play defense so they can prevent the other team from scoring. If you do really good on both of those things then you might have a good advantage that college coaches might pick you to be on the team. My second favorite sport that i would choose would be football because in my personal opinion football is the best sport because you get to tackle people. If you participate in football for your school you have to go training because there will be defensive and offensive coaches that will be there to train so you can get on the team for high school football. In training,you would do dead lifts,hills,drills,weigh lifting,and scrimmages. You have to do those things because thats what coaches want to see,they want to see their players train hard because the players want to make the coaches know that they will work and train hard to make the team. Finally, the best sport to choose would be football because it is a very aggressive sport and also the sport is very hard and you have to be a lucky person to make it to the NFL.This will be a very hard thing because you also have to do good school but if you dont the coaches might think about cutting you out of the team because they want your grades to be perfect. If you make it to college and you do good, you can be the luckiest people to be invited ti the NFL combine. But if you dont like football just pick basketball because it doesnt really matter what sport you wanna choose to play for your school.

Have you ever felt like you could not handle school?, well let me tell you that you have options, in here you are going to know the benefits of being home school. When I was younger school was a challenge for me; There was always conflicts at school and the environment was really a distraction, not good for me. Attending to school from hone have a lot of benefits. Students are going to be more focus in their studies and they are going to understand the meaning of responsibility. One of the reason why home school its good for students is going to be that students are going to be more concentrate and focus on their studies. Students manage to work better if they are alone, since they do not have any distraction around them like: drama, bad influences, mean teachers, stress and so much more. This is really good for those students who want to get their stuff done and learn more efficiency. So attending to school from home is one good option for those who want to focus on their studies. Responsibility is one of the most important skill that us like humans have to have. Being responsible is a hard skill to follow but it is the most important one since we use it on the daily bases. If students attend to be on home school they have to learn that is not easy and they have to be really responsible because they are not going to have a physical teacher in front telling them what to do. Therefore you have to get it by their on hands and learn the meaning of being a mature and a responsible person. Students are going to be more responsible because if thy have any project, homework or test they are going to manage the way to study and do their stuff by them self and using the tools of their online program. I understand that some people may disagree and prefer students to go to a normal school since they are going to have more social life. Having social life its really important but who said that being in home school means that they are not going to have any social life, its the opposite because if students are all caught up with their things they are going to have so much time to hang out with friends and family. In conclusion the benefits of being home school are really good since students are going to focus on their own things and studies also they are going to learn how important its to be responsible. now days we use technology for everything because it let us have a lot of more options if people is struggling with school. so more schools should include some online programs for students who want to continue their studies from home.

466,2030,4967076F4E7F,"I dont think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because when students coming home, they need to do the homework first. Maybe thats day some people have a lot of homework so they couldnt attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If they could open some video of online then I think some students cant watching whole video. Because when I finish my homework, I feeling so tired and I just want go to my bedroom or play game, message, Facebook, ... I guess thats habit all students because almost students doesnt wanna be work too much and parent will be for son or daughter spend time for favorite like soccer, bamboo, ukulele, ... If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster. Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day. And if you dont sleeping enough, you cant learning anything at school because you always sleeping in classes and teachers always say wake up, wake up. It not good for you and teachers. And when you go home, time for sleep but you dont feel sleep because you sleeping in classes too much. Thats why you dont feel want to sleep, and today to tomorrow to whole life, you still dont want to sleep early. Maybe that will be become the cycle in your bad life, If you dont wanna change your style. I think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home is not good. Because when parents coming home, they need talking, do something or have a dinner with family. Its will be better you do a lot homework. If you have dinner every night, you will have a lot of conversation with your wife or daughter, Since you will be know what your family want and your sentiment with family will be better and better. When students learning online or video at home, maybe they dont understand what video say and if they have a question, what teachers they will ask ? And if everybody have a question to asked teachers, the teachers cant responded the question too much for students. If students waiting for tomorrow go to school, maybe students will be forgot the question they want ask right now. I think students need learning at school better learning at home. Because one people one idea, thats mean have a lot of answers your guess and you will be know the best the answers from teacher. Itll be helping you how to do work team. Work team so important with students because in your future, labor need you know how to work together. If you know how to work, you will be become the manager or boss.

467,2031,81218F777A2F,"Energy should be conserve more because alot of people do not use alot of these particular items half of the time. It is better to save energy rather than waste. Like for eample, we use light everyday to see things around us so that we do not trip or bump into things. If not we wouldnt be able to see things near us. At times we take advantage way too much. Were wasting alot of light source that we hardly ever use at times. Therefor, were wasting alot of energy that we should not be wasting. Alot of people tend to go out to places to run some errands and leave there lights on for no reason or just keep the light on for no particular reason. The best way to save energy would be to turn off the light before you go out and not just leave it on because your just making your bills go up. When you do not even use it half of the time. It would help alot and keep you from wasting alot of money. Second reason, would be us not recyling things that we drink or eat. We tend to just throw it in the trash instead of the recyling bin. Even in schools they have recyling bins but us people do not pay attention to it because it is nowhere to be seen. It would be better if the recycling bin was to be seen. I feel like people would use it and recycle more. Also will save resources that can be cleaned and used again. Rather than just using more products to make the particular object. Schools and other places should make an improvement and stop using alotof energy and resources and make it easier for the resources that are being used. Us people should recycle more and save light source and actually help the world be a better place and keep it clean and simple. If we were able to do that it would make everything else easier. Overall, schools should not be extending it for two more hours. Reasons why is because teachers tend to use alot of paper to give students to work on. Most of the times teachers would not use front and back of the paper. They would always do work on seprate pices of papers and give them to the students. To make things easier for them would be to use front and back because there not using alot of paper. So that it can be graded on and be thrown out by the students. Students never like to keep paper with them when teachers grade them after. So alot of paper is going to waste for no reason. Teachers should consider of teaching students with technology and doing work on there rather then using alot of paper. Technology would help because trees would not be going to waste and harm the things around there surrounding just to make paper out of it. Alot of trees would be save and have alot of resources still. People should just think about the goods thing and the bad things about it. Like is it worth wasting all these resources rather than using technology. There is advantages and disadvantages of extending school for two hours. The advantage would be students being able to learn more and have more time spent with their peers and teachers. Students would have more time to do work rather than doing it at home and struggling. It is better for them not to waste time and get the help they need. But, at the same time the teacher is giving them work which is bad in the way but good also . The work that is being given to them is not bad but the resources that makes is because of how it is made. Eventually, schools should just use technology and do all the work there. Students would be able to access it easier and teachers would not have to worry about the students losing work or having problems. Students would also be more entertain because all they like to do or be on is technology and it would help the teachers alot. Overall this point, teachers or not just them should consider of managing the time they use on things that use alot of energy. It would make the world a better place and more healthier. Trees would not have to be cut down alot and affecting their surroundings. Basically would not cause pollution in the air and hurt things around it like for example animals . It is important to save energy an keep the world safe. Schools should just do everthing on computers and make things easier. Rather than wasting alot of materials for no good reasons.

468,2032,10ECA491D66C,"I disagree that someone can change you. First of all nobody can change the person you are from the beggining. Second of all no body can tell you how to be or what to do either even if your married or single. Third of all you have to be who you are you dont need to pleasure no body in this world but yourself. You have to be proud for who you are and what you are doing in order to be doing good in your ways of life. To begin with I disagree that someone could change. One because thats for you to decide if you wanna be the way you want to be. You cant change for anybody to accomplish whatever you want. If you want to change youll have to change on you know nobody can that for you. For example when I was a freshmen in high school I used to like skipping my classes all the time. I never went to my classes I liked being around my friends most of the time. My grades drops from 100 to 50 real fast. I didnt realize friends can make you go the down road. I felt like I did not care in the moment but then I realized all those friends were not real friends at the end. Nobody is going to help you get you stuff together, your grades, your education. I believe you have to always be your self in order to progress and success in your own life. Secondly people say that when you get married your suppose to be someone else that your suppose to cook at all times, do laundry for you partner and yourself, I believe that is not correct. I believe that you can still be who you are even if your with someone or not. You dont nessecarly have to be someone your not in order to make others happy. Your friends, your boyfriend or girlfriend are not going to give you a High school diploma, an apartment, a car, and food. You have to get that on your own you have to be happy the way you are. If you are a lazy person, crazy person, dramatic person, you can be how ever you want to be. You do not have to change to make the rest happy. For example I do not like being around friends anymore, I do not like drama at all that is just me I learned from my experience that no body is going to be there for you on your rough times and it is not worth changing for no body ever. Lastly I believe you have to be who you are and be yourself in order to success and follow your goals. Being your self is one of the best things there could be. You do not need to care if someone judges you. You do not need to be worried about anything but trying to accomplish your goals, your dreams and a better life style. You have to have a good character in order to achieve everything you want and especially being positive to yourself. Never let others try to change who you are or what you want to be always go by what you want and do not question your self. You have to be happy by the way you are and not think about how the rest want to see you. For example when I used to skip class in freshmen year in high school my friends wanted me to be like them they wanted me to skip at all times and just hang out in them mall or park. I realized one day I want to get somewhere in life I want to graduate on time, I want to have a good job, I want something different for my self. I realized I was doing my self wrong so I stop completly and started of my sophomore year fresh and different. I began to see the difference. My friends thought I changed and I did because I did not want to stay back with them I wanted to move on forward with my self and goals I had. This was my experience and ever since I realized being your self is a big worth anyone has. This is my opinion on why I disagree that you do not need to change for anybody. You always have to remain being the way you are and never let no one change the character you are just to make them feel happy. Even if you are with friends, boyfriend or girlfriend you do not have to change the way you are for them. Always be proud of the person you are too.

Although sometimes cell phones in school might be used for personal reasons like soical media the pros of being able to use your cell phones in school outweigh the cons. In todays current society millions of people use electronic devices at work and school , Schools should implement more use out of technology and let kids use their phones in class to help complete tasks assigned to them , for example , If a kid does not want to use a dictionary and to find a word he can easily just look up the words meaning on he internet using his phone. If someone needs to call you during school they can easily do it by just dialing up your number instead of having to call the school. It is much easier to call someone during school on there celluar device instead of having to call the school wait for the school to find the classroom the student is in and then transfer the call to the student in that classroom. In case of a family emergency , parents , relatives will call you on your phone most likely they will not call the school. I have had personal experiences with that as my parents do not contact the school when they wish to speak to me , they call me on my cell phone. Implementing better rules in school for cellphone usage is beneficial , instead of punishing a student for having there phone out in the classroom the school should make better use out of cellphones by allowing students to have them out and or use them. More schools , classes are making it easier to access assignments that can be completed online , you can view what assignments you have to complete in class by using your cellphone instead of being overwhelmed with paperwork , your tasks can be completed online. I believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms , it will make learning in class easier due to the easy access of the internet , in case of family emergencys and for any other reason you might need it.

The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you dont understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some students need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students dont know how to do the work sometimes it because they dont understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some students so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that dont know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers wants to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers dont wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more students to work in group i dont think students would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster In conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you dont like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you dont know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you dont understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some students dont like to work in groups sometimes it because they dont know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to students work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication students would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i dont know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",7,5,6,6,4,5,1608,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

Seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters much better because you can get many good ideas from people who had experiences before and know better than you. Making your own decisions can make your life worst. Also, its not good for young people to make their own decisions. For example, I know one boy he is 17 years old. He was all the time take his own decisions. He had money problems and he didnt tell anyone about his problems. After 2 years he became homeless.

472,2036,BD0CEEC9B429,"People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters for many reasons, there are some emotions following our own decisions whether is right or not, people shouldnt always follow their heart and do something it could cost your life in the future. Another suggestion is asking for help to those who knows how to guide and gives ideas to people following their own decisions . Having some different types of ideas from different people or culture it can help us to work and do better in life because lifes important matters. It can help our sociatity do better for our new childrens and the anyone whos around in our environment. First of all, some particular people sometimes shouldnt always follow their heart or emotions whether is right or wrong we can always seek for help and do what we like to do in our daily life. For example, the other day I made the worst decision because I didnt have the courage to share my thoughts with anyone in my family or friend about quitting my job or not. I felt like if I suggested to ask someone to help me clear my mind I was going to do better now. Next, later on I saw my manager and told me they had a better job position for me with better health insurance plan. In this case I feel that seeking for guidance is not always a bad idea, is the opposite we can help each other. I made a bad decision for not comunicating with others about my problem whether to stay or leave, what i did it was left the job. Secondly, in many cases we think we know a lot, but in reallity is that other people can help us to do and give new ideas in our life. Than, If I want to change something in my life I have to love myself more and have the courage to comunicate with others and let them know what I am thinking and expect a better results. On the other hand, making your own decision can also help you to be succesful about life and not depend on others. For example, someone whos expert, can let me know and give me some advices about a proyect because they alredy know it or went through and have lots of experiences in that area. I always believe imformation is important if we working as a team is the best for the human we get to know each other time and values. Although, everything works best when we seek for a true guidance. To conclude, in many cases people are really succesful because they met or know someone from different culture and shares different types of ideas. In this world we live in many times this is the best way to work with as a team by seeking help from experience people and open up our brain more to understand the problem and to move on forward in our life. If woman and man work together lifes gets easier because we all putting our effords so that we can have a better tomorrow for our lifes and childrens.

I thought he was serious and boring but it turns out he was actually fun to be around with and joyful.

Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take.

I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances. Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them. Well its true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they dont know how to let them out.

Students shouldnt use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldnt be doing and that wont help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldnt use their cell phones in class is that they arent learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and wont be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they dont do well on because they havent been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they cant do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students dont need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they dont need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they wont need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they wont be doing their work they will be doing other things that arent importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldnt be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades.

Also, we knows the risk of doing it.

Thirdly, energy is anothers problem because people spend more money. Even know, this increase a lo of accidents because customes companies just buy lof of thing as computer, cellphone, and toys. The problem is many peoples spend more time plugin in setting beside its divice charger to get some energy in their computer or cellphone.

478,2042,F1883C3A8C1E,It has been said that having a positive attitude is the key to success life. I agree but at the same time i disagree. First being positive can bring success in life we so many great people who found the key to success in being positive like Micheal Jordan. He was cut from his varsity basketball team but him being positive and putting in work help he found the key to success in his life. Next my second reason i think being positive can be the key to success is. Da Baby he was always told we wasnt every going to be anything but had stayed humble and positive and keep his head up and now he is one of the top rappers of are time now. he has multiple gold and platinum records and he has millions of fans and followers he has people who want to see him because he stayed positive and found his key to success. last i disagree because having a positive attitude isnt always the key to success because when the people out in war doesnt have a positive attitude because they have to be ready for the enemy and i think you wouldnt want to have a positive mind set in that predicament. In conclusion being positive can sometimes be the key to life and sometimes not having a positive attitude can still be the key to life.,5,5,5,5,4,6,3570,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders. The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems. Finally to shows the younger s how to do something, older student can be helpful when you need help they can help you. to ilistued. when i came to America i was in third grade i was new and i didnet know what are the school rules and i didnet know any thing about school and also i didnet know how to speak English.

480,2044,5C72AB0B1232,"Whats a career? a career is an occupation or a profession that someone do. People can start their career at any time in life. Its a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because career would prepare students for what they want to become in the future, and it can help students learn more skills and experience when they work with others. Firstly, career can prepare students for what they want to become in the future. Consider someone who wants to become a doctor. People who want to become doctors usually work at the hospital so they can watch how doctors do their work. For example, Generic_Name was a student at Generic_school and he wanted to become a doctor one day. Generic_Name started to work at the hospital after his parents told him that they didnt have money to put him in college. Generic_Name learned a lot of of things about doctors before he went to college; and when he went to college, it wasnt so hard for him because most things about doctors seemed familiar. Generic_Name graduated with a bachelors degree and he became a good doctor. This proves that committing to a career at a young age can be helpful in the future. Secondly, Career can help students learn more skills and have more experience of things in life. for example, Generic_Name loves when someone plays guitar and he always say that he wish he knew how to play guitar. Generic_Name was hired after he applied on a part time job which was called "" Teen fun time"". it was a good job for Generic_Name because they could teach him many different things including guitar. Generic_Name was taught how to play guitar by some guy who liked how Generic_Name was a hard worker and nice to everyone. After hard months of training, Generic_Name could play guitar by himself. people loved how Generic_Name played guitar, therefore, his manager made him play at the entrance of the building so people can enjoy while entering the building. Generic_Name was able to draw, paint, and cook after he worked at the Teen fun time for a while. Teen fun time made Generic_Name a good guitar player and a great cooker. Some people may say that it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because some teenagers turn into disrespectful children to their parents when they receive their first checks. For example, Generic_Name was hired at the boys and girls club. After he received his first check, he could not do anything his parents ask him to do and he would claim that hes going to be late to work. His parents did not like it and it made them unhappy sometimes. However, committing to a career at a young age is good because it teaches teenagers a lot of stuffs they need to know in life. Teenagers also make money from a career, which means that they can help their parents with small needs like buying clothes for themselves and shoes. In conclusion, a career at a young age prepares students for their future career. If someone want to become a pilot, they have to work at the airport so they can get some ideas on how planes fly. Committing to a career at a young age can help students learn more skills and have more experience on things in life. By working with people, students can learn new stuffs from people they dont know. This proves that committing to a career at young age is good for students.",7,7,7,7,7,7,1194,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
481,2045,94131A88E955,"In my oppinon school is good how it is now. having go to go school for a couple of months straight across and then just have a couple of months off for summer. If they were to change the school routine to kids having to have breaks for 3-4 weeks they wouldnt come back with the same effort as they do when they come back off of summer break.. For example if I were to leave shcool for 3-4 weeks I wouldnt want to come back to the same classes and with the same routine, Its just that Students do retain the information they teach they would have to go over it just so they get back on track. But the fact of having year-around school isnt it just doesnt make a diffrence. and im an sure that kids wouldnt like to have only 3-4 weeks off school after all the time they spend in school This is why students should have a right amount of school and a certain amount of months off. a year-around school benifits teachers not students. because they if they did have a year- around teachers wouldnt have to worry about re-teahing it again to the students because they would expect them to already know what they are taking about. so they should have a regualr schedual for te schools board to follow. But at the same time the fact of not having to go to school for weeks sounds good. when their break is over they would have to go back to school not only that but they would have to pick up from where the left off at first. I feel like leaving in the middle of a lesson that is important that really wouldnt have the studets as much. if they were to change the school routine it would just mess things up with the students and their grades and that would e more work of teachers. What if some important test is coming up for the students and they only have a certian amount of time to get things done within the time period and then they would leave on break what if the teacher couldnt get everything done in time then te whole class would fail the test. This is why they should just leave school as it is just so that students and teachers wouldnt have to go throught all that trouble, Just get what they need to get done within the time they are their and then when they are done with all the work they needed to get done with they could leave for summer break, just so students dont stress over the facts that they have to get things done in a certain amout of time. These are some of the many reasons why they should have school for months and not take breaks inbetween school days just so that they have months off on their summer break.

I think this is a bad Idea because students should be required to be in school eight hours everyday. Allowing these students to take online courses they lack teaching and intructions in a classroom, evening school is a poor idea, and elective courses should be required to boost their gpa. Letting students to have these options they might not enjoy school as they should. In other words, I think students should and must be placed in a classroom. Take an example physical education and health is a required course for graduation. However, how can you allow a student to take a course like that online and expect he or she to learn. I am not saying it impossible; I think they should be taught. A course like this deserve to be in a gym somewhere so students can interact with one another. Also, most students do not comprehend well through a screen and this might affect their way of learning. Also, I think evening school is a bad idea because students need that eight hour of sleep every night. Giving them these options it could lead to bigger problems. This could ruin he or she lifestyles because they have to be willing to get up at night to attend school. Abscences could rise up because the students could be tired. When they have this option parents might not be able to take them to school if they live far and this could lead to safety issues. In conclusion, school districts should insist the traditional four years of high school. When they have an extra year, they could use it to boost their grades. Having elective courses could help the students dramatically. Most students tend to score low in one class then others. Letting students take elective courses it could boost their gpa.

First,I think that Im a responsible worker, because I never stop doing my work until Im done with it.

First, the good thing about about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also when they hit a high note on it it gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it it looks easy. Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and its hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you wont be able to play as good on it. The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour everyday .

Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues. Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy.

After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be. Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They dont do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school.

There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.

489,2053,DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success. First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them. Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving. Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed. Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving.

490,2054,B4B8BEB77C2E,"One topic that is frequently debated is about the benefit people receive to take classes online. Some people think that if someone want to keep study they have to go a school to take that class or the classes that they need. They feel that some people do not deserved the chance to take classes from their home. In my opinion i think that taking classes online is a good opportunity for many people because people can work and study at the same time, those classes can be more cheap, and not everybody have the opportunity to attend a college or an university. First taking classes online is the opportunity that everybody want, but not everybody have. The people that take classes online is getting many advantages. They can work at the same that they are taking classes, they can take the classes during the flight or if they are in another country visiting their family they can take the classes there. They can do a lot of things during taking classes online, and they always have free time to do whatever they want. But the most important you can help your family in home or and your country. Second online classes can be more cheaper than attending a college everyday all day. All my aunts that graduate from high school are taking classes online and they are close to end taking classes. They said is more cheap and we can save money taking those classes than attending everyday to a college. They save money and now they are capable to pay and attend a college. I personally think that is a good option for me to keep study save money and got o a college. Finally go to a university in United States is something that not everybody can do. Because you have to speak a perfect English, you have to have good grades, your GPA have to be great, and for people that does not born here and is not a legal and just have tree or 4 years studying is almost impossible. My sister born here she went to Generic_School she was in the ten best GPA and now is in Virginia Tech University one of the best universities and Virginia. I do not think i will go there i just have tree and half years here, i will take classes online during my parents and me save money to pay a college. I am planing to got to NOVA but i will take classes online first. As you have read classes online have many advantages that we can get if we take it. We can save money, spend time with our family , visit many places and the possibility to go a college. Classes online is the way that you can get your goal, the way that you can feel comfortable taking it at home. But also is the way that you can work and get money. classes online was made for people like us, that are trying to study and be a professional in the future.

491,2055,D0A5FF29C338,"First impression counts the most and its impossible to change. A person point of view on someone can never changed because of the many thoughts that go throught the mind, after getting to know that person because no one would want a friend like that. Having a serious face, not taking care of yourself and dressing wrong can lead to having a bad impressions, thats when people think of you in a different way and get things wrong that are not true,but due to the bad first imprsssions it change everything. Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example youre life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that. People now days dont want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people dont want to talk to you because all it wouldve took was a smile. Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just dont care about yourself why would you care about others. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesnt take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you dont smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you. Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and youre wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they dont know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they dont have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference. In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they dont talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important.

Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers. If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they cant met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didnt know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to dont fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that cant come to school. In the world are students that cant attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to dont attend to school. Many of the students that cant attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work cant give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they dont attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students cant come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they dont receive a good chance to learn more. Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you cant practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you cant practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you cant concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home. In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you cant attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and dont get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they cant assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.,6,6,6,6,4,7,2981,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
493,2057,37193A72B5D2,"Teachers and some adults think that some students are expected and have the capacity to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Student are the only ones who can decide If they are able to take care of that responsibility or not. In my opinion I think different and I dont think that young students are able to carry out with a career and a will support my reasons. First of all I think about all of that students who are already independent by their self, they probably have a job and need to pay their own bills, the rent, their phone, and they maybe have no time to carry out with all of that responsibilities with their education and the career at the same time, they need to work hard study and that is not easy for them. As the same time they probably have a lot of homework to do and they need to be responsible at their job. Another good reason I have is that some students without time they have no help, and they have no support from other people to try and see if they are able or they are already capacity to care about the career in high school, many students are able to do it but some of them are not able to pay for the help or the stuff need for the classes, some students have the luck to find people who just want to help them, and give them the opportunities to go on and help them with the decision they take to carry out with the career in high school but teacher or other people just dont want to help them just because they think and the give their opinion that they are not ready to take that decision and they still learning and have not the capacity to work on it and they just leave them and the dont give the students the opportunity to explain or show them that they are able to do it. Also a lot of students are fighting and giving all of they can with their education and they are giving up, they get tired with all the classes they have with all the responsibilities they are carry on and that why is hard for them keep studding in high school but must of the student are strong and still working to getting prepare even if they are having problems at their house or problems with their family they just wanna move on. Even though that some of students are too young in high school and they are still learning about how life is, how hard is to take care about the responsibilities the adults are already taking on and they think how hard can be if they take the decision to identify a career by the time they enter in high school it can be difficult to them because with the rest of the courses the are taking they will take more then normal classes. For some reason the students are not even thinking about their career when they are just enter the high school they are probably focus in the responsibilities they are going to have or they are already have in high school with their education, they have to take care of them. A lot of student make a mistakes, for example when they doesnt care about their education and they focus on being the best in their personality how many friends can they have or how good can they look, they need to ripen on their attitude and star thinking about their education they need to think how good in their education can be better on or how good grades can they have to make their family proud or how far can they go if the keep working hard and make proud of their self. People can think that it would be easy for them or some of they can think that it will not. I think that it is not a good idea selected to guide them toward a specific career, thats why I just explain my reasons so they can see that it will be difficult, hard and stressful, they are too young and they cant take care of a big responsibility.",7,5,7,7,6,7,717,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
494,2058,52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people havent. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things. With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasnt been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. Theres also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table. Thinking about things in places you shouldnt, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you werent paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty). Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldnt do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why its a rule. Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it.",6,7,7,7,7,7,1082,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
495,2059,FC9DA73D1EA0,"Even in classroom everything catch students attention! Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they dont focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face. To begin with, sometimes students dont learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer. In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do. For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind. To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home. At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away. In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass. Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily. Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.

496,2060,E19E1BEB08EA,"I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. I also personally think that any project with a presentation should be a group project. If that presentation has more than just the presentation it should be a three person group. Working with a partner is beneficial to students, because it gives extra support or help on a project or classwork. If a project is too big and impossible for one person to complete they could split up the work. For example, when I had a final project in my english class; I separated the work with my partner. We had to do an essay and a PowerPoint presentation. My partner did the essay and did the PowerPoint presentation and we both finished in time. If I hadnt had my partner, I probably would not have finished the project in time. My teacher making it a group project made it way easier to do because I didnt have to worry about writing essay. Another reason that working with partners is beneficial to students is that they can build new friendship while doing work. When students are doing work in groups, they are together the whole class and have to stay in contact outside of school. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time Im making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job. Another way that working in partner benefits students is that it saves them time and makes them finish their work quicker. If the students split up their work and do their work efficiently they will finish quickly. The more group members will make it even quicker. For example, when I was working with a friend and two other students on a project for a book we finished the book very quickly and the book review was finished very quickly as well. When partners are helping each other it makes everything way easier and more fun as well, because you get to hang out with your friends while being productive. Also if the teacher lets students pick people, they can pick people that know a lot about the topic of the project or classwork. For example, in when I had spanish we did a project about Puerto Rico and since Im from Puerto Rico everyone wanted to pick me. I went to a group where a good friend of mine was and the project was very easy to finish and present. The project was done so quickly that the next class we had free time for the whole class. Thats another reason why working in groups is so beneficial and good. Working with partners can also make students more comfortable with the subject or the project. Students sometimes get handed a project or classwork without knowing what to do. Having a partner to help the out is great so they can get comfortable with the subject or the project. For example, when I was Earth and Space Science I had no idea what to do on a project the teacher was assigning. She assigned partners and my partner told me what to do and I finally understood. The project took us about two days to finish but it was a very hard project to do that would have been impossible to finish alone. Groups of at least three people should be required for project of more than 2 assignments. Two people cant do a project with five assignments and should have that extra person to split up the work and no one does extra work. For example, when I was in the sixth grade I had a project where I had to write about Mozarts story and I had to write an two paragraphs, buy and design a poster board, and also give a presentation and memorize everything. I did the essay but forgot to do the poster board until the night before. I had to stay up to 12:30 at midnight doing the poster and memorizing the 2 paragraphs. If the teacher would have made it a group project, I wouldnt have had to worry about the poster because my group members were on top of it. Another reason that groups of at least three people benefit students is that maybe one of the students doesnt want to do any work theres still another group member left that wants to do the work. For example, my english teacher gave us a presentation to do on PowerPoint and we split up the slides. But one of the group members didnt do anything, so the other group member and me had to do all of his work. We presented got points and he didnt. Thats why its so important to have groups of at least three people, because you still have a backup. Some people say working alone is beneficial for students because you only have to worry about yourself and no one else. However, if you work with a group or a partner the work gets done quicker and easier. While doing your work you can also make new friends and get help from them. Also, it helps pick out partners for the future that you know that those people will execute and do their work. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time Im making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job and be productive. I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. Bigger projects have to be at least a three person group because two people cant handle big projects by them selves and should have extra help. Thats why its so beneficial for students to work with partners on projects and other big classworks. ",7,7,8,7,8,9,3225,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
497,2061,79D634E4575F,"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it wont be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face. Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline. One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldnt offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesnt have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesnt include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shoulnt offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they wont have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school. In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people. In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make studentss life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students. Students dont see benefits of attending online classes, instead it just make their life difficult in many ways.",7,7,6,7,7,5,1598,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Once youve found it, you could do all sorts of things and find whats best for you. Some people have great talents, some have bad ones, but they have one thing in common is that they practice really hard to master them. No matter what they say, dont let it get in your head just focus on getting to master your talent first. Practice makes everything perfect even if you found something new, and you want try it out. The first time you wont get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to. An example of this is if youre riding a bike, you fall down, but through practice youll be riding your bike without falling off of it anymore. We were all born with some talent that we dont know of, we just got to figure out what it is. If you found something youre really good at, then stick with at all times, and never let that talent slip away. If it does then you will be forgetting everything, and the talent you once had, and youll have to find a new one. Based on your experiences try to find something different but a little simmer. For example, if you worked at fast food restaurant you might want to work at a store next time. They have one thing in common is money. Whether having a talent or just practicing, know that youre having fun whether you hate it or love it, and not for very long you will master it in no time. If you have done some of these, then you are ready to master a new talent.

499,2063,E56D7CC27444,"Some people believe that glorifying a students work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a students work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves. One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a students work will help them to be self-consident. Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort. Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem. In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",7,8,7,6,6,8,3316,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Having to cook for many other people and do work for school was really hard even when she would try to do her best it was not easy for her.

Knowledge to know and keep in mind that maybe that person you learn something from put so much effort into it or maybe not.

To succeed from that experience to do better, to learn and to know that from that experience you can succeed and keep in mind what to do good. Its a good thing to learn from experiences. You might as well relate to their experience that maybe you did not even know you could relate to. Sharing wisdom with somebody is always a good idea. I think it helps people to improve and succeed and learn from mistakes and learning new and different things. In other words, sharing your experiences with somebody brings a connection between you and that person.

503,2067,F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future. Its true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person. Secondly, Its also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made. On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life. Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible.

504,2068,24C508ED6FE2,"It is true that there are many ways to influence others. Its not your behavior that defines your actions. Its how you show people by your actions, having goals and to have motivation to be able to influence others. Sometimes you dont even have to be positive to be able to influence others. For example, in the movie ""The Princess and The Frog"" , she wanted to open a restaurant because it was her dads dream. So she kept working to get enough money to pay for a building she wanted. She didnt get it in the beginning, but at the end of the movie she did. What im trying to say is that she had one goal and it was to open a restaurant. she also had motivation to keep working to earn enough money to do so. For my first reason why you can influence others in different ways is by your actions. The best way someone can influence others is by your actions. For example lets say you help out by donating food to your local food bank. That wont make much difference but if you do it daily, word will eventually get out on how you kept donating food for people in need. Especially if it gets on the news about the good deed you did, then more people would donate more to help out their community. For my second reason why you can influence people in different ways is by having goals. Many people whit goals accomplish more that people without one. For example lets say that your trying to save money to buy a new game that coast eighty dollars. But you dont have any money left. So you do chores like cleaning, washing your parents car, or cutting the grass. You still dont have enough. So you start going to your neighbors house and asking if they need anything done. Eventually you earn just the right amount to buy the new game. Basically, if you want something set goals and accomplish them to earn what you want. For my last reason why you can influence people in different ways is by being motivated. You cant influence others if your down. You have to try being inspiring and energetic. Because if others see you being motivated they would most likely do the same. Being motivated is important because it shows purpose of completing a goal. It also shows how hard you are willing to work to accomplish something. some people may say that,a persons behavior is the best way to influence others because it sets the right mood on someone to be motivated. But on the other hand behavior doesnt show how a person can be influence to do something. Therefor the best way to influence people is by showing them your actions, goals, and being motivated.

This is why most the countries doesnt have one them or both, because they spent more money on, doing other stuff like makin new buildings, restaurants and etc. Instead of that, we should be saving money on resources, so people can eat and save energy by turning most of the lights of just need to turn main lights on, beacuse in todays world companies make money of the people, by sending them extra bills eventhough they didnt use that much energy. Schools are one the most places to waste more energy. It could change, if we have less school hours we could save energy. In my school i mostly see all the lights are on, if there is no class the lights should be turned of, this is one of the big reason. In most of my classes the lights are turned of, because we care about our school.

He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas. My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks. my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it make us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is now a days, they is not that much joy in life more people then ever are sad so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.",5,5,6,6,5,6,2148,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
508,2072,3ADC97CB1DB6,"First impression can change. Most of the times they do change. Its rare for someone to act the same once youve met them because eventually they change. Nothing really is the way it seems to be. When it comes to first impression its always important to act a certain way. Everything changes , people change, things change eventually. When it comes to first impression people always change. Sometimes when you meet someone they always want to seem kind to the other person for them not to think anything bad of them but good. When you go into a job interview you want to dress appropriately, you also want to act appropriate, and respectful with the other person when that may be out of your comfort zone. Some people can change in a relationship they act all sweet at first but then one day theyll just switch up on you and act different and be different from when they first met the person. Most of the times thats always the case people just act different from what they got in their first impression. Nothing seems like the way it should be. Meeting people is nice but from what you can gather from the first impression is not always enough. Ive met people who have thought i was mean because of the way I looked that was their first impression on me but then they said when they started to actually have a conversation with me and actually talked with me they realized that I was really nice and not mean. Thats the thing about the first impression it always changes. People can look at certain way but act completely different. I like to dye my hair different colors some people find that intimidating because of how I look but im a nice person I love to meet people and talk but it may not look like I do. Meeting people is an important thing in life. Everyone is always meeting people which means first impressions matter. When you meet someone you dont want them to hate you, you want them you like you. You have to act nice and polite even if you are not in the mood to be nice or even if youre the meanest person you have to be respectful with others around you. You change the way you are most people do it and dont realize that they do change from when they first were with the other person. Ive met friends who i thought would do good for me in my life because of my first impression with them but turned out to be toxic and bad for me. When you see a rose it beautiful, it has a beautiful color to it, it smells good bur when you want to grab it there are thorns and it hurts you.

509,2073,16B45E8AA9F3,"Honestly i think being honest cant always be hard or sometimes easy because, when you did something wrong you feel guilty, telling the truth gets rid of the guilt that you had, and also you feel a lot of stress. Letting the stress out in your body is good at one point so be honest! Your body will feel like your hiding something and be afraid to talk so just be honest, for an example, you broke your moms favorite vase but she doesnt know yet. ""You"" may be afraid to even talk to mother because ""you"" wont know if ""you should lie or be honest or you might even feel like you will get in trouble. Its good to be honest because your parents will feel like they can trust you for an example being home by yourself and taking care of your younger siblings . If your not honest your parents might think that youre lazy and dont actually take care of your siblings while there out grocery shopping. Not being honest can cause problems with you and your parents relationship. Its your job to be grateful of your parents, what they give you and how much they support you. If you have a friend who is good with their parents maybe try being like them and try your best to love and appreciate your parents at this moment. Now that you know how to appreciate your parents and be honest and not lie, let me tell you this we all know we will lie maybe once or twice but after you can just say, ""Hey Im sorry i was not telling the truth, will you forgive me?""

There is a another way for them they can go to school summer and they can take classes the ones that they fail or take some other classes the ones that they need to take if they dont want to keep on going to school. also if they stay in school, no abuses, and stay out of trouble they can probably graduate in three years. If there bad grades are low or GPA they can take a another class that can bring up there grade up like, do a sport, like soccer or art. or they can ask a teacher if they can change there class where there where is two teachers.

511,2075,F65622698950,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing""? I believe, when most of the people dont understand how relevant is to do something instead of being inactivity that also serve purpose because like everybody else it is normal to always do or make good things for someone, and it could be family or close friends for example. My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you dont deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you. I understand that not everyone are gonna have the same thoughts as me or with other person. However we need to be on the side to the change for good. I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because youll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again its a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing youve done for her or him. Sometimes some people misunderstood about always doing something for her or him like you dont have to do it for them, but believe youll feel great if someone do something for you isnt a bad thing then you will be fine and grateful knowing that theres good people around you, and ready for help you. You aint alone anymore believe theres people for you and try to not think too much about it. My conclusion is about to always do something for people because there is people who will need you, and being around, and everything you want to do for them it will make it better like. Thomas Jefferson wanted to do good stuff as a president caring about his people, and making him one of the best presidents, so it is wonderful to done much for them than yourself.

Lets say he is wrong and my behavior is not the best way to influence other people, and maybe people only care about famous people and look up to them and get influenced by their behavior. Some people may agree with that statement, I just feel like its not completely true. For example, lets say I was very unknown by a lots of people and they see me saving a kitten of the road. Will people be influenced by my behavior? even thought they dont know me, would they agree with my choice in saving the kitten? or will they follow someone whos famous?. Albert Schweitzer said, ""example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" What he is saying is that no matter how famous or how infamous you are, everyone will follow someones example no matter what the conditions my be, at the end someone will follow your behavior because they are influenced. This is why the quote that says ""first impression is the last impression"" because no boss is going to hire someone whos: shows up to work late or nor properly dressed or doesnt look serous to take the job. The conclusion of this statement is, that everyone is influenced by someones example and it doesnt matter who the person may even be.

Yes, you always have to do something to become the succeed person that you want to become, to reach and achieve your goals, and to stay active and social with others. In my native country of Generic_City people always work hard, to get money, feed their families, and also teach their kids how to succeed in school and other athletic stuff, with the bad community that we have in their. As well as here a lot of people study and work hard to succeed. For example, at Generic_school we have a cooking class, they always push us forward and try to teach us new methods how to cook and seasoning the food, that gives a huge opportunity for the students who want to do it for living in the future. Another reason, is that it will be twice as hard if you say I want to achieve this goal at the end of this semester, but you are not working to improve your self to achieve it. This is problem that everyone have, like on our swimming team I had a really difficult goal to achieve, I started to push my self to the limit and work as hard as everyone else just to achieve it. And at the end of the season I did achieve it, which was to get a time that under 35:00 seconds, I shock myself and made my coach proud of me be achieving it. Finally by working outside, or joining an athletic team, or vising an old friends its another really good way to staying active and social with others, and talking to other people is another great way to solve a lot of problems, specially when you are sad or having a bad time. Others may think that staying not active for a bit or at all is a good way, they think that because having a time alone with yourself kind of make you think what is happening around you, However, if you fill your time with friends and activities that you like to do, you will not feel want to be alone because you will have a good friends all over you all the time, and they will help you to reach the goals that you want to achieve.",7,6,7,6,6,6,91,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

516,2080,A643E3470F54,"No,I dont think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework. You cant even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep theyre getting and If kids come to school the next day,they wont get the information they need for their classes because theyre tired. Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in wont be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why theyre not getting enough sleep. Im not saying its impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it its likely students wont get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students cant graduate from high school. To rap this up I say that the main reason why I dont think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future.

517,2081,CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school. Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they dont do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you dont want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you dont go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you dont have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things. For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and dont tell anyone because some people dont want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they dont get it. Those kind of people dont want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and dont tell any body because you dont know what others want for you. Its better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesnt have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they cant do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you dont do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they dont want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it. When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they dont care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that dont like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to dont have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you dont want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you dont have those good grades and you just are copying others and when its test time you dont know what to do because you didnt do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. Its better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others. People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they havent go through things like; one of your friends dont like you and they dont want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and dont tell everyone because you dont know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they dont care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they dont want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you dont stay in front of them as a looser because you didnt they dont know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that.

You didnt get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you cant do anything.

519,2083,62102D1B1A52,"Do you agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive. First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up. Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future. Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself. In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.",6,5,6,6,4,6,1278,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

First, Lot of people reading a book and watch TV show or video on the phone. When I was in Generic_City, I saw lot of people read a book with their phone or tablet, Also they are still watching a video almost every times when they are in the vehicle, but this is not a negative effects on peoples lives. This is positive effects on peoples lives, because they are still reading a book. Second, many of student are not doing homework or not focus on their school, the main is they are not doing homework and play video game, Also they are using a phone or listen music while middle of the class. Or some people not studied and cheating on the test or quiz. but they will get a good grade, but they dont know what they learned. Finally, Old people doesnt know about technology, so some bad people using a technology for old people, and they get money from old people. This thing still happening lot of country, like Korea.

I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school dont have any experience of any career. I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career. As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",5,4,6,5,5,5,3645,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Many students dont have enough time to study at home and a after school club could give them more time to study what they need to. Some students need extra help understanding what is on the paper and studying could help them a lot. Next, after school homework clubs are important because students can finish homework faster. Some students cant get homework done at home so an after school club could help them. Students can get extra help with what they dont understand at an after school club. Many students cant students can get their homework done faster by the help of other students. Additionally, after school homework clubs are useful because students can socialize. Students can learn how to talk better to other students. Students can talk to friends when their done with their work. Many students cant talk to their friends on the other teams so after school club could fix that.

Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldnt because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat. Those who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time. In my opinion I think that schools shouldnt allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they werent doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat. I think that schools shouldnt allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didnt study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.

Taking classes online give the student a chance of doing classes in the other side of the country or anywhere. Many student are not able to attend school. Attending online school give the student the advantage of working or doing their own projects at home for example student wont relay on school supplies. Students by taking classes online benefits then, because some student have two jobsor lives to far, and they are to old for attending school. For the students that have two jobs.

People should be able to rely on their own decisions on life, so that they do not become less self-sufficient in the choices that they make. Firstly if you keep relying on others than you become someone who can not do anything on their own without the help of other people. Another reason would be that people might think you are unable to do simple tasks in life because you relay on other people too much. Lastly self-sufficiently is an important skill that everyone should have through-out their life. Your past choices defines who are you today, so if you relay on others too much than you become a different kind of person you once were Other people who spend their whole life heavily relaying on other people develop no self-identity of their own. I highly doubt that Tesla or Einstein relayed on anyone if not no one on the work that they did. Additionally if you do not have a self-identity people will not remember who you are. Secondly if you always have people telling you the answers in life it is hard to live without those people who helped you in the first place.

You should always listen to your brain and not seek out help too much, or it will affect your life in very bad ways Still, some may say that people who seek help from experts are smarter than people who do not. That people who seek out help will be more informed in life, therefore they do not have to worry about the things they do not know. This may be true but its better to find the answer on your own than to always ask for help from experts.

Sometimes its good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you dont always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references.

A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future. Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said ""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face.

She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her. Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose.

After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

One small play ground for little childrens under 9 years old. And then the other one will be for kids above 10 years old. Now i will describe what will i want to look like or have on the babies play ground from a 2/3 year old kid to 9. kids and parents will like to have tiny slides of a hight of 3 or 4 feet tall and have sings that are special for babeis. Then little benches were they can sit with there parents. After that i will like does little horses made of plastic or metal, that you can move back and forth. Then now i will tell you and describe you how can kids will love kids to have on the other park or play ground from kids from 10 and above. So maybe kids will love to have two fields because maybe they like to play soccer or basketball and tennis so one of them will be a basketball field with small soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot because a lot of kids like soccer and basketball. Then the other field will be a tennis field. What kids will love too is have to courts on one field too. Then for the slide i want four of the to have a hight about 6 or 7 feet tall and two with curls and the other two, just normal. Then the other biggest ones will be of a high of 10 feet tall and i will promise you that kids will love it! So they dont get bord and say; this is boring. This is for little kids, i dont like it!. So this is what i think that chlidrens will like to play on. That is all i wanted to say.",6,6,7,7,6,7,427,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
535,2099,163A54729CAA,"Other people would say that failure is a way you learn about your mistakes and where you can improve. Being successful isnt necessarily a way of failing so much its a way to show that your trying and trying while not giving up. I would have to agree on Mister Winston Churchill about ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, I believe being the person whos mistakes or failures is someone successful because they didnt give up they believed on theyre selves and continued to work harder. First, when you seem to fail everytime but, you just keep believing in yourself thats how you know you want to be successful and when you look back at those days in either high school,work,or even at home. Youll noticed that those days werent perfect but, its a way for you to learn about your failures in the end of the day you become someone whose very successful. My parents told me to always believe in myself and to never give up and if you fail over and over then get back up and do better. Second, its not just us people who has failures but celebrities also had failures believe it or not. Celebrities went through what we went through. Classmates either said ""your not gonna be famous your just gonna fail."" or "" Your failures wont lead you to be successful youl only fail again."" They didnt care what theyre classmates said they just kept trying and trying until they made it. For an example, Will Smith he kept trying to be successful in the acting world and he once said that if it wasnt for his parents who told him to keep trying he wouldnt be where he is. Jackson Wang, his a Chinese artist who didnt think hed become successful but now people see him as an inspiring artist who is also in a Korean boy group. So in other words, if you keep failing then keep trying because youll become someone someday. In conclusion, Mister Winston Churchill is right about ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". His message about it would bring people to theyre feet and not give up. Just keep trying until you made it. Dont every say you cant do it, just keep believing in yourself you can do it.",6,6,6,8,7,6,304,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The second reason is to earn money and hours, when the workes work great an a job the company is pay more better , in a group is more beneficial for the company and for workers an extra hours, because they do more efficient job, and also workes can help to earn more business with other companies and other countries more practical to work in a group they can help each other.

537,2101,E3096B04916A,"Nowadays many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences. There is a debate if school should or should not control students involvement in extracurricular activities. Some people think that students should be more involve in extracurricular activities. However, I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families because students will have to much pressure on their shoulders, students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study, and students have to work. One reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will have to much pressure on their shoulders. They will be always worrying about school stuff and the fact that they have to spend a lot of time in extracurricular activities. Spending to much time on extracurricular activities can led students to a depression. They will not get enough rest because of not doing anything else ,but extracurricular activities. Students will get tired that they would not want to do anything else. Students Another reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students will not have enough time to complete school assignments or study. Students will have little time to study for a test or quiz. Evidently, not having enough time to study can led students to fail their classes. Students will not turn homework or projects on time. Students deserve to have extra time to study. Final reason, why the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families is that students have to work. Students work to be independent. Students work to pay for their future education. Students work to help their families financial. Students work to achieve their future goals. They work to not have a miserable life in their future. Work will give them more opportunities in their life. To conclude, for these reasons and so many more is why I think that the decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their families. Students will have a lot of pressure, students will have lack of time to study or finish with their homework, and students got a job. Schools should think a little bit more about students responsibility and how controlling students involvement extracurricular will impact their life. I know that the education is very important ,but student deserve to make their own decisions. ",8,6,8,8,6,8,3266,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Specifically, if I make a mistake I can learn from what I did wrong, so I can do a better job at it next time. On the other hand I could play for a team and I could practice with people better or not.

539,2103,32E2949B0C66,"Do you ever want to do something fun at your school that you really like? Well you came to the right school, cause the principal made a rule that you either have to play a sport or join a club that you like. You could play on a basketball team You could play on a football team You could play on a flag football team You could play on a baseball team You could play on a softball team You could play for a soccer team you could join a cheering team I agree with the principal because, when we get home we dont do anything and kids are lazy nowadays. We either take a nap, eat, watch YouTube, or play video games. Also it will give kids a chance to have fun and make new friends and see what they like so they can do it the future. So if you dont agree with me, Ill give more reasons like kids are overweight, theyre lazy, most of them wont do anything cause they are out of shape. Probably the first thing they do when they get his eat and play video games and watch YouTube. So that is why the principal put in the new rule, they could make new friends while theyre after school or join something their friends are in. Also it will be good if your going to play in high school sports cause you already known what it takes to be on the sport team. It is really fun cause you when you play a game that is home you will feel good cause everyone from your school is there cheering you on. Also if you win your game at home it feels nice cause everyone is cheering your team on and then when you go back to school everyone will be taking about the win. If you dont believe me ask anyone that plays/played for a school team, most likely your parents played for a school team both of my parents did. If your not interested in sports you could do other afters school activities like Book club Yearbook club Dance club Cooking club Computer club Student council Engineering club You could do those clubs in stead of playing sports, You could also do many other things that you like if you dont like any of this thing. Ask your teacher if you could make club and if she says yes go to her office. If you dont like your club cause everything was filled it is fine, cause you could join it the next semester but you have to be one of the first to sign the sign-up sheet. Also you be given a snack at the beginning of your after school period you could choose anything and, if you take the bus it will be there so you can go home. But if you dont take the bus you will have to be picked up by 4:30 and then you be home and do whatever you want to do. But if your parent can pick you after school you could leave at the normal time school gets out and if your not feeling good you could also leave at the normal time. But before you could anything you have to do your homework and then go to your after school club. If you dont want to go you will have to go to the principal and explain why you cant, but if it is a dumb reason you will have to go to after school. Like if you have a broken leg and you play on a sport team you could still go to practice and see what they are doing and see al the drills they are doing. Also if you fake an injure and the teacher find your big trouble cause you not listening to the principal. But you could get kicked out if your being bad and you will have to serve a punishment cause your still on school grounds. Like you you hit a student you will get suspended but if you hit the teacher you will get expelled. If your playing sports it is all year long until the season ends, if your coach finds out your is taking drugs you will get kicked of the team. You will have the same rules as a high school cause you probably play for the high school team. But it wont costs any money cause the principal made us join the clubs so we could do something after school. Most likely we will find our hobby forever cause we are going to do it for the rest of the semester. If you find something that someone is doing and you want to do it just tell the teacher cause they will put you guys together. If you still dont agree with me you should just try it out cause it fun, You could have fun, make new friends and bond over things you all like. Like sports if you join one of the sport teams you could meet someone with same interest like you. Same with all the other club that the school is providing to the students, like book club you could like the same book as someone else and be best friend over that one book cause you joined the book club. I met one of my best friend through basketball and we liked other stuff that wasnt basketball related. Most likely you wont like it at first but then when your half-way through the year you will love it. Most of the time I join a club that i like cause it fun to meet new people that have the same interest as you. Sometimes the club isnt fun but that is okay cause you could join a new one. Most of the time everyone will be shy at the beginning cause no one knows each other but half way through the semester you will known everyone. Cause everyone wont be shy cause they will see you everyday plus, when your in school at lunch and you dont known anyone and you see one of those people you could sit with them. When you meet a new person they will have friends so you could more friends when the new person shows you to them. So what we know is that joining an after school program could give you a lot of benefits and friend. Also they is a lot of clubs and sports you could join for fun. Also eat a free snack so your not hungry when you get home to your parents. ",6,6,6,6,7,7,658,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

543,2107,93EF5F755313,"To who may concern. The Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is well know that some people believe in this statement and some other dont. There are some reasons to believe this is true: one, failure gives experience to do it better next time, two, failure makes one think about different possibilities to be prepare to control the situation, three, failure gives the option to try again. First, failure gives experience; this helps to learn how to dont make the same mistake. For example, to learn how to cook is a ""try and fail"" because one needs to put a specific amount of spices and vegetables is a long process to give the food a good flavor; failure said what are the mistakes one needs to correct like to dont put much sugar in the cake or dont put much salt in the salad. Another example, learn a new language is difficult in various forms like the pronunciation or the form to make a sentence; failure give experience to improve abilities like these too. Second, failure makes one think about different possibilities. For example, if one try to built a ship inside a bottle and fail because the little pieces of the ship broke inside for dont be careful, that persons if going to think about what can make the pieces break next time to avoid the same situation. Another example, if one flew a kite and a bird or the wind make the kite crash, the next occasion ""what can make the kite crash?"" is going to be a possibility to think. Third, failure gives the option to try again. For example, take a test driver and fail but still studying to take it again; to get the necessary score to pass, this show that person decide to try again. Another example, when one try to learn how to do a magic trick, the first times fail is guarantee, but with perseverance one can be the best magician, this can be only reached if one decide to try again after fail. Although, one can learn from the failures, is not necessary fail to success, but sometimes one cant decide to dont fail; fail is a form to learn something from the mistakes, for example, fail to do something can make one know what is wrong and what is necessary to do to correct and prevent a future failure. In conclusion, one dont need to fail to learn, but ""perseverance is the key for success"" and when one go from failure to failure without giving up; the action to dont give up show how capable is that person to success.",7,6,7,7,5,5,1961,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

545,2109,B1AFACE6704E,"I agree with Michelangelos statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilties further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life. Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilites. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses: honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want; yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learnt so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits. Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self esteem. With a higher self-esteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emmits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life. In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelos statement. Setting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal.

For my point of view, I think that is good to be positive, becaus if you are positive you have more chance to be successful in life, most of the times you can or can not regreat good things. Is good to be positive on the bad times, that way you do not feel worse. If you have a positive attitud, some people that have negative attitude is going to try to make you change, do not let that happend. be positive can make you a better person. If you are going through bad times is always good to be and think positive, if you are a negative person you are going to see only the bad things of the good things, you can lose friends or youre family members, if you are a negative person, no body is going to like to be next to you. negative people is going to try to make you change; some people can be selfish and if you always think positive and most of the times you regreat positive things, they are going to want to have what you have even though that you work hard for if. However some pople can think positive things but they can act negstive, it does not means that that good or not to think one thing and act with another thing, but if you want positive thigs happend to you most of the times, do positive things too.

Then i would be actually be proud of my self that i graduated from school and saw that i finished school and yes it is important to graduate because its a important thing that you have done in your life. Also you can get any jobs you like if you graduate and take education and finish school. Would you like to graduate? if so you should.

After all of that you can do any career you want because you graduated from mostly everything and thats why its important to graduate. And there is more reasons why you should graduate but those are the mains ones for me its like my own Opinion i dont know about what others think about you just need to take education in order to have a good career or get a good job if you want. Also graduateing can show you that you learned new subjects and you passed them and you feel great about your self when you do those new things.,4,5,6,6,5,5,2518,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
550,2114,EDA0DCA3FC41,"I dont think that school districts should allow students to graduate early. I believe that this is a bad idea because students have to take more classes than what you usually take, students would have to stay after school or maybe even take summer school, so they can get enough credits to graduate early, and students would be very stressed having to learn all this material for each of their classes, since they wont be taking any electives. For these reasons, I dont think school districts should allow students to graduate early. Students who are graduating early, will have to take extra classes during the school year, so that they can earn the credits for their classes. In many schools, you have to have at least four credits in one subject, so that means the student will most likely have to take two classes of one subject to earn the credits for that one specific subject. Some students graduating early, might have a difficult time being all caught up in each of their classes, which can lead to them having to stay after school to take tutoring classes in case they dont understand the material being taught. Most students, will either have to take school during the summer or they stay after school to take extra classes. Students who stay after or do summer school do this, so that they can earn all the credits they need to graduate early. Students who choose to do summer school dont have to take that many classes when they go back to school, since they already took some classes during the summer. Students who choose to stay after school to take extra classes, will have to stay in school longer, so they can learn all the material for the subjects that they are taking after school. Students will be stressed and under pressure when it comes to learning and studying for each of their classes. They will be stressed because theyre going to have to study for a lot of their classes, when they take tests and sometimes they can have tests in multiple classes on the same day, which means they are going to have to study for multiple classes. Same thing applies with homework, they will feel under pressure to get all their work done. They wouldnt be taking any electives, so that means all their classes will be hard, since elective classes are usually easy. This is why I think that graduating early is a bad idea, because students will be very tired and stressed trying to catch up on school work. If you do four years of High School instead of three years, everything will go a lot slower than three years and also you will be less stressed, when it comes to catching up on school because you will have less classes to worry about. This is why its better to do four years of High School. ",8,8,8,8,10,10,3477,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
551,2115,CF45352F8424,"Do you think positive attitude is a key that everyone need in order to be a successful person in life? In my essay I will talk about positive attitude, if it is important or not. In my opinion attitude should be always positive, because it can help you to succeed in work, can encourage people to do their best, even if what they have to do is hard to do it, and it can be a great tool in order to succeed in relationships, and believed in yourself. When I was working in Mango Paradise, my boss was a really bitter person, that was always angry with everyone in the work, but I was one person that I didnt care about his bad attitude toward us, I was always with a big smile, perhap how he treated us. There was one day that he had a bad day, because one member of his family was in the hospital, and was very delicate, he was an a mood that did not look like he was the same one, he was sad, he was devastated, and worried, because the person that was in the hospital was his wife, she had cancer. So, that same day I asked him if we may talk, he said "" Yes"", I just wanted to talk with him and tell him that perhap everything, we were there to support him in everything he needed. Unfortunate, his wife pass away, and as I said to him, we were there all the time supporting him, we were there with a positive attitude telling him, that everything will be okay, that his wife is gonna be in a better place where can rest in peace, where she will not suffer more. He was so thankful with us because how we supported him in that bad moments that wanted to increase our salary, many of us accepted, but many others not. He really change since that days, that many of us, we are still working there, and earning more money than we regurlarly earned. In every human life, there is always a hard problem, that make us to give up, but there is also a person with a positive attitude that makes us to get up, and continue with our life. There was a time in my family where we had a problem of money, my father got fired on his work, we almost lose the house where we were living, because we did not paid the rent in almost four months. My father was devastated, he was looking for a job amost for three months, and he could not find any job to pay the rent, so we would not lose the house. As every wife do, my mom came to him and said ""Do not worry sweetheart, we can get out of this problem as we always do, I am here to support you"". My father almost immediately changed his attitude, he gave to my mom a big smile and said to her "" Thanks babe to be always with me, and for trust on me"", he get up take the keys of the car, and went out to look for another job. He found a new job where he earn a little bit more than his previous job, so our moneys problem disappear. Believe in yourself not always is easy, some times we though that is difficult to understand yourself, but there is always a lovely person that help you to believed in how strong you are, and to see all the thing that you are capable to do. When I was in 10 grade, I had an algebra teacher that was always telling us that we had to believed more in ourselves, sometimes we did not do what she asked us to do, because we did not understand, many of us were disappointed of ourselves, because we didnt even try to do it. In the first quater many of us in our class period failed. We though that our score would never change. After that many student changed their attitude, but it was not because we wanted. It was because our teacher talked with us, and made us to believe that we can do anything that we want to do. Some time later many of us had changed, as we changed, we saw that our teacher changed too. The second quater passed, and the students were happy because their score in the algebra class, many studentss score were from 50 to 90, it happened because all us changed our attitude in different manners. We paid more attention as we should since the beginning of the year, we started to believe in us, we started to do things even if we didnt know how to do it. Until this moment I am thankful with my teacher, because of her, we changed to a better score, because of her we believe more in ourselves, she just wanted our best, but sometimes we made her get angry, because we did not believed in ourselves. We changed, all of us did, and she became for me the most good person as a teacher and as a friend, she was always supporting us, and teaching us. That is why until this moment she is one of my favorite teacher, and I think that for my other classmates she is too. For that experience that I had, I think that possitive attitude is something extremely important in every human life. Our attitude has to be always positive, even in the worst moment of our life. Some people think that a person should have a positive attitude just during a very important moment, or in happy moments, this is not correct, they all are wrong, we need to have a possitive attitude always in order to succeed in life, and to be happy. In our homes old people as grandmother, grandfather, sibblings and parents, need to give the example, so kids will take it, and they will be confident and a positive person.",6,7,7,7,5,5,2855,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

However i think we should all be free of making our own decisions ether you want to make it by your self or you want others with more time and experiences to help or make your decisions, but people should be award of what they choice because every decision can gave a consequence and the only one who can make the right choice is you.",5,4,5,5,4,4,2266,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Firstly, you can form pictures in your mind. Creating pictures in your mind is useful, because you can draw pictures that is in your mind, like sketching a house that you want. You can form pictures in your mind by visualizing a situation that is interesting, like playing a game in virtual world. You can create interesting ideas that you can use to draw picture, like using a digital art to create a picture by thinking an interesting ideas. Forming pictures is really important. Secondly, you can create interesting ideas. You can create something that will give a lot of attention like creating a fantasy book about Wizards vs witches. You can be creative by creating interesting ideas, like having a unique plans about something that is cool. You can create quotes, like Albert Einstein did, because he had a interesting Idea about Imagination. Creating interesting ideas is unique. Lastly, you can fantasize about something that is exciting.

Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didnt had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of. However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school. The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, its something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status.

In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that. In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future.

Then by using the program, you connect with a random student that learn the same subject as you. And they can teach you the same thing as what your teacher taught you, but they speak to you slowly so you and the other younger students can understand if they dont understand then how are they going to pass a test or a SOL, so basically its like your getting extra help. My Second reason is, they help younger and older students is because theyre both learning from each other, but it will be hard to make a program because we will need a lot of stuff, but its worth it because the younger students need to understand what they are doing.

Job opportunities and getting notice by important people are opportunities that come with having an affirmative attitude. This kind of posture can benefit ones future. If more individuals convey a positive attitude many would have better employment opportunities. Jobs can help you be successful. Working for the president of the United States is a more beneficial job then working a regular nine to five. Showing an affirmative attitude can help you work for the president and can also help you have a better income which can lead to success. Having a good occupation is important. Since its important to have a positive image it can expand the people you meet. One way is by having a confident posture. This helps you have a better chance of engaging with significant people like the president. This attitude can lead one to have job opportunities. Looking at the other side being negative can also help you be successful in life. One example is by being selfish. Putting yourself first in everything you do can lead to success. With this negative image shows that your the most important person that can only bring you a favorable outcome. As many have stated displaying confidence is the way to go in life. Employment opportunities and getting noticed by important individuals can bring success. With most success theres always positive results. Obviously one should always be positive if they want a desirable outcome in life because life is too short to be unsuccessful and negative. ,8,8,7,7,8,8,2942,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

This way may economize resources so school can use this pattern also. But for this idea people have different opinion. Someone say school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours because only four-day school students can not learned enough knowledge. But in my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources and four-day school may promote students efficient study. Some parents think four-day school is too sort for them children can not learned enough knowledge. And three-day weekend is too long. them children may do not study. So parents worry about the foreground for them children. In my opinion I think school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because this pattern is very good for economize resources. We can do a easy math for this question. How many electric for one lamp? How many lamp in one school? How many school in US? You can image it is a big resources spend just for electric. That is why I am agreed the four-day school. The four-day school have benefit to student also. Because students need learn five-day knowledge in four-day. It may promote students efficient study. The efficient study is useful for the study and work at future. The resources is valuable for us. We mast economize them.

In addition,another place I use math is at school. This is the place where I developed this skill. Teachers have an excellent job making me the person I am today. For instance, I am doing my project and need to get the dynamics right I use make to help me with the project. I would like to became a math teacher at my school. Math is all around us , but you just dont notice it. Moreover, the last place I use math in is at my house. I use it in dividing my chores with my siblings and I use in the kitchen when I am measuring ingredients. I also use it when I do my homework. It helps me when I am playing basketball because you need an arch to make the ball straight in. It helps when I am older because I would already know how do math and know how to use in the real world.

If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate. First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later. Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life. In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences. Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place. Another lesson for that is something they hate is not mean they give up or not finish it because it is a part of testing in the life.

568,2132,E91431653DE3,"Prompt The author Waldo Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, about to be individuality. I disagree with him because there are many occasions that you need help from someone in life. Is not just to be individual is to know how to management your life in your time. In this essay i will talk about some ways the we can work together. Firts i will explain about, job issues and results. Second i will explain about society, and how can be relative to be not a individual person. Finally i will expain how to take decisons, and to make them work. This may prove that individuality doesnt change the you can not be, what you want be. There are many ways the can be a ocation of individuality. In your job, might be someone you do not like, because his or her behave. You can try to work with the person, is not just be a individual person, beause you might need the help of the person one day. If your try to work with the person to broke the individuality between the person in you, that can be a avance to be relative to other people. Another occasion on individuality in your job can might be because, you are not doing what you dreamed about to be in the future. The doesnt mean the you can not fight to get your goal, if you dont like your job try to do something the you like been working in a job that you dont like is typical of individuality behave. Many companies work together as a team to get there goels, you can work with other people in your job as a company. Some people prefert to be alone in many times, these people we can know as asocial. This people just want to be alone becuase they feel comfortable like that. There another people the doesnt like to be around others people, because they like to do the things by there own. They like to be the one the everyone see, the point of attention these people we can call as indiviluatys. Not all them are the like that, because there might be a reason to makes them to be like that. Maybe for their background. Be around of society is sometimes is more complicate then what it looks, mostly if you know people like that, but you can try to work with them or somethings these people chage. Some them beacuse they look for help and others change because someone close to them help to change for good. We all make decisions in life but some those decisons can make us to do something wrong or to be a different person. Try to be anoter person is not just to want to be the person is to make a decision. You can make the decision to be push it by the world, or you can make your own decision of what you want to do in life. Many people take the decision to stay in a world that management their life, because they think the is better or because is the easy way. The president can deciside to work alone, and make the things as he wants but he knows the he needs to work together, we the people in the congress beacuse by himself can not do everything. As the president we can make the same, decision as him to work together or not. you can make your own goal to fight for what you want or to be constantly push it by the world to change you to be something else. In summary we all have the decision to select which way to follow. As i went throught about job and result. Also i wrote about hoe we can live around the society, and how we can result conflicts. Finally i explaned how we can take are own decision, to be what we want to do, and what can be goal to follow to change, or fight for it. This can be a result the Ralp Waldo Emerson, is wrong about to be push it by the world constantly, beacuse you change that and be what you want to be.",6,5,6,5,5,5,3386,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Schools should limit on how much extracurricular activities they can do, having too much will cause confusion among students in class and too much is always not good. having their families decide for them is an option, but the best decision should be for the school, for they know how well the student is doing. Research from age between 21 to 26 shows that 95% of them wanted to decide for their children,They wanted the best for them and the best they will do, That is the job of the parents. A blog back in 2006 shows that people who decides for their children most likely to get a job than people who decide on their own. A Research conducted back in 2010 shows that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, having them to decide will greatly benefit their mind and shows that they are responsible on how they act. They like to choose their own path and find their own talent. Finding their own talent shows responsibility, and having responsibilities at a young age takes courage, dedication, and hard work. Having too many activities will also cause a lot of their energy to get drained, they wont have any energy to spare for other activities like cooking for dinner, or doing assignments. The school should keep track on every students activities, This ensure their safety and heath. Having every energy drained from your body is bad, and the school should keep track at their time as well. Having more energy will greatly benefit their health. The school is partly responsible for the students, but the parents are most responsible and should know what their childrens are doing, if they think their doing too much, they should talk to them and have a simple chat about overworking. The school can also add a one simple rule where people who has 3 activities or more should be given time at the end of each classes 15 to 30 minutes free time to discuss with their teacher on how well they are doing and to do missing work or assignments.

Research from this school shows that students have increased their grades when they added this rule back in 1996, it increased from the average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA, This huge increase shows that adding this simple rule will benefit not only the students health, but their grades as well.

This doesnt mean that your not allow to change your mind in the future, is just a help from the school to see if you are interested in what you want to do when you get older. You have four years in high school to change your mind. There is so many careers that you could like; the school will provide you the classes that you need in order to graduate, and also classes that talk or teach you about the career that you pick. Thats when you have to start thinking if thats what you actually like, and remember that whatever you pick, is not permanent for your entire life, because you can change your mind any time. Dont stress out a lot, because as a freshman you can change your mind for the year that is coming up. You have another year to pick new classes and see what is that you actually want to be. Identifying a career by the time the students enter to high school, is probably a chance to see if they are actually interested in the career that they had in mind. You have around ten month in school, in those ten month you have the chance to know more about the career that you pick in the beginning, so while the time past by, you can see if you are actually interested in the career for your future. If is not what you thought it was going to be, then for your next year you can talk to your counselor about it, and they will help you giving you advises, because they are allow to see you grades, so they will see in what classes you doing good, so they can help you pick a career that you would probably like. Student have the right to change their mind any time that they want, because the 75% of the students that are in High-School are not mature enough to actually think in their future, most of them are not ready for life. When you are in your last year of high school, is when you have to start getting ready with what you actually like, and see whatever classes that you had picked in the beginning of high High-School was actually what you wanted to be in the future; because after that you will be going to collage. It is a good idea to give the students the chance to identify their career in the beginning of High-School. Also their mind will change every year, the years that actually matter in order to go to collage is junior and senior years. Those years are the ones that you have to get ready and actually put on your mind that any classes that the school will put you in will be a guide toward the specific career that you have picked. The classes that you have in High-School is just a help to open your mind for the career that you could have in the future. It can be helpful for some students and for others it would not matter at all. It is not necessary to identify only one career when you are just entering to High-School, because you are most likely to change your mind and ideas about the career. There is a chance that you will forget what you wanted to be as a young age. While the time past by there will be so many other cool career that you will be interested to do, or to learn more about. When you are picking your classes and your counselors and you talk about your future, or what would you like to do when you go out of High-School; is a good chance to let them know your ideas and your goals, so they will know what classes to put you in so it can help you as guide for your career and also for collage. In conclusion, giving the students the chance to pick classes that will guide them toward their career, can be helpful for them to see if they are actually interested in that career or no.

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others.

In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others.

Beginning,with this statement i agree because, when we were young little kids we would always imagine that was our big thing like, as an other parent would probably say to your child "" your child has a big imagination "". And imagination will always be apart of us we grew up having our little or big imaginations how do you think we would imagine us in the future or like some other examples: how we want to wear out clothes, what type of clothes we wanna wear, what design we want on our cake, or and how we imagine unicorns, ninjas,or any of those type of things ,and superheros. without imagination we wouldnt know about that or the sense of knowing what that is. Also, having imagination is also good because were not always gonna use our knowledge like for disable people not all of them have knowledge or even know what that is,for one example blind people yeah they have knowledge but also in there life they use there imagination throughout a blind persons life imagination is something they will use in there life spam and you wanna know why how do you think blind people know what a teacher is talking about or how they are drawing it blind people use there imagination they use it so they can understand what the teacher is doing or when there walking down the street or when buying clothes,There number one thing there gonna always use is imagination knowledge might also help because you have some information about it or do they just magically know what there doing no they imagine it,or they imagine were this thing is or that thing.

579,2143,5EF21F142C51,"Have you ever wanted to seek others opinion on a choice that you had to make?.Seeking others opinion on a choice you have to make is right. I think seeking others opinion on a choice that you have to make is good,because people can help you make the right choice for your self,learn what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you,and learn new ways on making that choice One way you can seek someones opinion on a choice that you have to make,is by asking people what they would do if they had to make the same choice as you. by doing this you will known their opinion on making that choice. Most people dont ask others on what choice they should make,because they think that people would make fun of them on making a choice on a certain topic. For example when someone has to make a choice on if they would buy some toy against buying a video game. I too have been in that type of problem. Another example is making a choice between wanting to get something you like but there are more than one things you could get and your friend making fun of what you say you want to get. To sum up my first reason of why it is good to seek peoples opinion on making a choice,because you then can use others opinion to make your choice. Another reason of why you should seek others opinion to make a choice is to get help on making the correct choice. One way you can get help with deciding on a choice is by learn the steps of make a choice. One way I learned the steps of making a choice was from a book my mom had got me to read. The steps of making a choice are first think of all the choices you have,then checking which ones you like and they suit you,and finally making your choice!.One other way is to ask friends and family to help you decide on your choice. A example for asking your friends and family to help you make you choice is,One day you had went to the video game store and you see two video games you really want but you only have $70 to spend,so you ask your brother on which one you should get and he says the racing one,but you dont known if you should save more money so next time you get both or just buy one now. Lastly,My final reason for why seeking others opinions to make a choice is right,because you can learn different ways of how you can make your choice. One way you can make your choices is by finding all the possible outcomes. Another way you can decide on what choice is by asking friends and family give you ideas on the different choices you have and which ones are the best for you. An example from my life I have is,one time I was going to the ice shop and me and my brother did not known what favor to get,so I said why dont we try the new favor,because we had not ate before,so I think my idea for what we should get was good,because I came up with a new choice that we never had thought of before. In Conclusion,seeking peoples opinions on making a choice is good. I think seeking others opinions on a choice you have to make is right,because you can learn what they would have done if they had to make the same choice,help you make the right decision,and learn new ways on making that choice.",8,8,6,7,6,6,1223,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
580,2144,A4A90A401002,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. This is reasonable for each individual, and people should make their own decisions in life. We always ran into problems and sometimes we need to make decisions on our own. When we have the choice and decide to make the differences, its important to follow our instincts and we have to take the responsibility to make the good choice. This is how we learn by ourselves. In our daily life, people always ran into problems and get stressed out, for example, the car broke down in the middle of the traffic, failing the test that youve been studying for weeks, your boss fired me today... However, it is our choice to make the right decision and to change it; you could call for help from someone, you can study harder or ask others to help on the school work, and also look into other jobs that you are interested in. There are so many options for everyone to pick and to follow our own instincts and ideas to make everything better. As an adult, soon after high school I will be joining navy and have my own life, to do everything by myself. Everything around me will change completely,I will not have my parents standing beside me to teach me common sense, nor my teachers to teach me about life lessons, nor any of my friends to be there and help me out, this is all about me and my decision to make. If Im going to learn the hard way, I will have to learn the hard way. Maybe my instincts kick in and help me out, you never know. Making your own judgment is one of the most important survival skills we will have to learn in life, everyone will grow up one day, to have your own family and all the responsibilities, now you are the one who have to decide everything, to have responsibility for not only yourself but you family as well. Instincts will tell you which way your heart goes, and sometimes it might leads you to the wrong path, but dont worry, this is how we are going to learn. Success is not an easy path, its full of adventure and false on the way to finish. You will experience more fail than you can ever imagine before you achieve the goal, to success it all by yourself is to follow your instincts and ideas. You may have concerns that what if you seek guidance for experts and authorities about lifes important matters? Guess what, life is full of adventure, you never going to know what is coming next and not everyones life is going to be the same, so therefore seek guidance for experts may work for some people, not all, you may have found a different solution for yourself. All we can do is listen what others advises are, Because you will be the one who make the final decision, and you are responsible to your decision, not anybodys advice or common. Everything is on you and to follow your heart to make things right, or to learn how to judge then choose the right path. No one will change your life unless you let it happen, no one can change your final decision unless you dont follow your instincts and heart. This is why we should make our own decisions, not only to make things right, but also follow your heart and to understand about lifes important matters.",6,7,7,8,7,8,2208,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
581,2145,3564BBEC4A09,"Should be there a difference between people who wants to find more accomplish or inactive! There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesnt have to accomplish any thing. It doesnt matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we dont know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us. First, when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. Its less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too. Second, In the past women didnt have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country. Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesnt matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasnt able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy. In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just dont lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose. However, many people cant handle success because they lose their self to quickly.",6,5,6,5,5,6,694,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

How could older students help younger students with school work. Older students are smarter then younger students, whereas younger students could learn faster then older students. My older sister is really smart every time I ask for help she always helps me and she shows me how to solve the problems that I dont understand.

Team work is something really important to learn about, because it could help you talk with more people, and you could get great ideas from other people.

One time I had to work with an older students with this project that I had to do. They were such a great help and they showed me how to start it and how to end it.

May breath fresh air and entertain themselves in something that can motivate to follow forward. I agree that students should be required to take one of these classes. Its very important to be creatives in some moment. Taking that type of classes make to students being relax forgetting for a moment the problems, helps to lose some fears, and above all they can benefit in their future. Arts in general can help to people who can need a break of all the problems they have everyday and thus not live with stress. I have a friend who live with so much stress for every thing he pass. He try to be the best in all of his classes, but that cause more stress on him. For that reasons, he decide to take one or two free hours everyday to relax himself. The best decision he take was to choose a music class. After he start to take the class, he told me: ""The guitar class is very amusing and interesting. It helps me to forget all the problems that cause me stress. It was the best decision I take."" Now I see how my friend is so happy and calm after he start his guitar class. He changed because he found something that he really likes to do and that helps to be relax. The performance class helps students to being more sociable with the others and lose one or more fears. Im a girl with a lot of fears, but my biggest fear is to talk with others. That fear start to appear with the passing of the years. I was not a timid girl when I was a kid, but little by little I think more in what the rest think about me. Thats why I decide to take a drama class. I need to confess that the first classes was very hard for me because I didnt speak with anyone, but with the passing of the days I start to speak with my companions. They were kind with me so that was more easy to me to have a conversation with someone. The art classes can be very important to some people because it helps to have a good future. I have a teacher who I always show her my drawings and sculptures because she is my favorite teacher. She is not a art teacher, but I know she appreciate me so much because every time we talk she told me: ""Your drawings are so beautiful, in the future you can be a teacher of art or sculpture. I know you are going to have a great future doing what you really likes."" I think a lot of what she told me and probably after I finish NOVA Im applying to some university about art, and maybe I can apply for a grant about art. In conclusion, its better if students take a music, a drama, or an art class so that can relax and have fun at the same time. Most of the people believe that type of classes should be electives because some students dont like to play a instrument, act, or even drawing. But I think that every student needs to take one of that classes to leave all the stress away. That type of classes are for students to turn on that creative part that they have inside and can have fun, not to being boring and stressing every time.

586,2150,B727B720430B,"To whom it may concerned: For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes. As long as their phones are in silence or they wont be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, theres a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus. Students shouldnt be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever theyre inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you dont have your phone by your side and didnt noticed that something emergency from your family is happening.

There a lot that we can talk about but i highly recommend start off with the events and problems that we are having today. These events are not only effecting us its effecting the whole UNITED STATE OF AMERICAN. Government shutdown it not only effect us its effecting everyone business ,stores,farms . Seeking help and guidance make a huge different .Not only one mind that is speaking but there should be more so we talk and decade bout the issue and we can give more ideas and information. we dont need to tell our child to be followers there are leaders by teaching them these skills make a big impact . Leaders always seek help too they start off small but over the time the income until one point you have all knowledge you need but still to this day we still ask question grab more information. we can compare these skills and source to our family,jobs,lifestyles. Its not only students that need it .Having self-reliance and seeking guidance by seeking more information make us better in our jobs,lifestyles. We are also leaning but at the same time we also teaching it to others these skills are not useful. We would all need them reliance can be compare to leaderships standing up with you think it right for you and your career we believe that our answer is right but we dont want to be wrong but by seeking guidance and other people ideas always asking questions give you other option to choose from. I highly recommend that we always want to be the right but sometimes seeking answers and ideas give you more to think bout not only you and others too. we dont have to go far the military ,world decision does it effect us? yes it does why im asking you it because things no one really care bout really we should these are problems that need to be solves. Military is a job,life and a career in your hands. Those man and woman that are serving our country they had a hard call to make. Before doing all that they need those soldiers to be ready there mind and skills are the most important that were self -reliance comes in to play. They can wait commander give you the call but you have man and woman life on the line you have to make a decisions. That why drill soldiers get you ready at base boot camp for mind and skills to ready and thing of these issue would not happening .doing that time you always need to ask question grab information it important you give you more feedback on what you work with or what are to get these skills are so important not only for the military in our life too we have big decisions to make it can involve your kids or career these thing you need to keep a look out. NO matter what age,race,sex,color you are is so important to seeking these things the are really useful in the future and now always think that these skills get far and one day you would teach you kids bout money and business and more but right we all need to see what is really going with our government make a change we do not what to have a stock market crash again so use your voice,skills and etc to helps others not only yourself this world need to voices and our government need to rise again where it was before our jobs and homes are so important and how we spend our money and time and seeking out questions and answers make a big different in our society and community Our jobs we get by our boss and our boss get there money from the government.

588,2152,58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and wont even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either. My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think its really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and its shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them. I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that wont do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do whats best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it. Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and thats another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea. Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their lifes for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",7,7,7,8,8,7,1144,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
589,2153,FDE0B653AD74,"When you play activities or an instrument, dont you get a relief when you play them? I like to play volleyball, because I can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you. My first reason is that I can make new friends. Having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. Friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. Friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. If you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. When you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life. My second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that I am interested in. Doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. When you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. People dont just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. When you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just dont need to give up if something goes wrong. My third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. It is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. But to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. Sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. It feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. When you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. You dont just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport. My fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. Sports also give a different point of view of people. Having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. Sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. And, whenever you feel along you can go talk to your teammates about it and they will help you out with it. Teammates are the best part of the game, because they open so many new doors to you and you just have to work hard enough that you can go through the doors that you chose to live with. My final reason is that even perfect people make mistakes in games. If you want to be perfect in a game, you just have to practice a lot to become better and better at it. Practicing show your teammates that you care about them and the game. New friends always pop out from different angles in your life. Life without friends would be miserable, because you have nobody to help you in anything. Playing volleyball is really important to me , because I can make new friends it is really fun to hit the ball when it comes towards you, and give opportunities for a new and better life. In conclusion, sports are really fun, because you can always gain courage in the game. You can experience things you never experienced before. It can make you want to become a coach, because if you are a coach it will be fun to give kids what they want to play and get new ideas of new kinds of games that they can play. Your life doesnt always depend on the game, because we always have something else to do even if we have a game and it is always hard to find what time you are going to play the game. It is how the life will be when you are a grown up. Our lives always give us surprises that we dont expect. Sports are the most important thing in our lives, because they helps us overcome our fears of communicating with people.",8,7,7,8,8,7,3854,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Forthemore,be active help us to increase our skils and the practice made an expert because if we are always active in what the teacher tell us to do at school,we can increase and be more and more faster the next time,that also can help to find a job because every boss want a good worker, and also that give us a good reffert because anyone can say good things about us depending on what we have done do far at schools,even outside the school like comunity service. In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world. Moreover,sleep good and having the hours to rest help us to be active the next day dont feeling tired and sleepy because the students have to wake up early on the morning and gives all what they have at the school,everyone want to be a good student and pass the tests and everything,also be active depend in how much energy we have thats way we have to eat on the morning to have energy and be active the all day.

I could easily write about my six years of experience in this area, and you would see that I could ""qualify"" for this visit, but I dont want you to select for those reasons; working in a TV Production company has always been my dream since I was a kid. I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasnt like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, Im not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it"" I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school. Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didnt know If coming to America would change my dream, everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I dont have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career. These are just some of the reasons why you should select me to visit and learn more about your company, I know you may have more applications of students with better grades and experience than me, but no all of them have the passion and enthusiast that I have, because this wouldnt be just a job, I would be a the biggest accomplishment for me.",8,5,8,7,8,7,3520,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 5, cohesion 8"
592,2156,6EB1681A5880,"I disagree that students should be required to take an arts as a class but as an elective they can choose between what type of art class that they want to take,for example if a student wants to take a music class as a elective they,ll have to check in with their counselor to see what class that they don,t need so that empty spot can be the elective that they have chosen. Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous. Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective . Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

594,2158,10DA9316D02D,"This program helps students to learn new things,helps older students to mature of teaching and taking it seriously,and helps younger students to socialize with new people and to communicate,and prepares the older students to prepare lessons and teach and be more organized,it can also help older and younger students to learn new different skills and learn different ways. The first best thing about having programs for younger and older students is for the younger students can learn new things. I think its best to teach young people to learn new things because it can prepare them in the future. I think that the program can help the younger students for they can learn interesting new things and for they can decide what they want to be in the future. If the younger students get help from the older students to learn new things its good because for they can use that information and teach other kids what they have learn from the older students. I think this program can help many other young students to learn new things from the older students because its a better way for the students for can use what they have learn and use it for something for their future life like for example math they can use that for paying taxes and bills I think that this program can help students learn new things. The second, thing that is good about this program,is the older kids can mature from teaching younger students and learn how to be more thinkable about what to teach and how to teach something. I think that this program is good because the older student learn how to focus more on what they are able to teach the younger students. The reason why I think the program is a good learning resource is because when the older students know more things than the younger students they can decide what do they need help on learning what should I teach them and how do I teach the subject to them so it makes the older students more focus to how to know how teach a younger students and the best way to help them. It helps older students because they can think in a better way and to make them feel more grown up teaching someone that is younger than them. This program helps older students because it makes them think more harder and it also teaches the older students how to think more ideas and thin what happens if they teach that, or well this lesson help them, and makes them ask questions to themselves. The third reason, how this program can help younger students, is because the younger students can communicate more to new people they dont know. I think that this program helps younger students to communicate more is because if they talk to more new people that are helping them they well be less shy and it well make it less difficult for them to be shy to talking to someone new. I think that this program helps younger student to learn better to communicate is because they can get more confidence, and not be scared to talk in front of someone new and different. I think that this program dose help younger students with communication because when they talk to someone new they can feel more comfortable talking to more people and be more social. This program helps younger people to communicate because when they talk to someone it can help them to be less scared to like present projects and talk to a crowd. The fourth reason, why this program helps older students to prepare for lessons and be like a more organized,thinkable person. I think that this program dose help older students be more organized is because they think what they are gonna teach them and what the younger students are struggling on. I think that this program dose help a lot of certain older students be organized because they think what time,and day,where they are gonna teach the lessons to the younger students. I think that this program dose really help the older students to be organized cause it makes them more prepare what they are gonna teach and how they are gonna teach it so basically, the older students think were to put what. Why I think that this program dose help older students to be more organized because they plan everything in order. The last,reason why I think this program is great is because it helps both younger and older students to help each other and to improve there learning skills. I think this program dose help both young and older students because if they all work together and help each other it can make a difference on helping and making people learn in a way certain way an easier way. I think that this program dose help younger and older students cause they can both share their learning skills how they learn things and shares ideas. I think this program helps because all the younger students and older students teach each other things and help them get better at something they are having trouble at doing. I think this program dose help cause it helps every students to learn a easy way to learn in different ways like flashcards,reading something over and over again,watching turturiols videos on how to do a equation or math so this program helps to find the best skill for you. It helps for all the students for they can learn faster and easier and help others find their best learning skill to focus on what they are learning.

595,2159,A53DEC5A2DE8,"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone. Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it. The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity its more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you dont know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do. Another reason, why working with someones else its better. Sometimes student dont like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students dont really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and dont let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher. Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because its fun. Working in a group its more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. Its always nice meeting new people and getting to know them.

There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future. Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that. Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing.

602,2166,12F89E196E97,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are actually doing."" Idle refers to people who are not busy or keeping themselves occupied to their powers or implements. You would think being inactive serve a purpose, but personally i think it does not. To be occupied gets you to accomplish a lot in life. People who do not keep themselves busy tend to not get far in life. In other words, to not be engage in work or activity is a very poor thing;there could be plenty of opportunities for you, but just because you are inactive you could miss these awesome opportunities. When we lack the ability to work or to keep ourselves occupied we are being inadequate. People who do not push or work themselves never actually really make it anywhere in life. Therefore, if we are always ""doing"", we will not fail to meet our expectations. If athletes were never idle or always ""doing"" some of them would of never made it in life. However, inactivity does not serve a purpose because when you are inactive or simply not doing anything you miss out on what life has to bring you. We would accomplish so much if we always kept ourselves busy neverless. People who lack strength or courage are inactive. So when teachers say use your time wisely they are telling you to be Idle. It is wonderful when you are doing, being active, or pushing yourself because when you do these things you never miss out on any opportunity. Lastly, when you are Idle you serve a purpose for yourself, family members, and you encourage others around. People who are active push themselved to do better. Being active can get you a good job because people will speak highly of you and recommend you to others. You ever heard of ""hard work makes the dream work"" when you put yourself to work anything is possible. Your peers around you will look up to you because you get stuff done and it would push them to do as you do. In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson says when you are determined never to be Idle you serve no purpose and you are determined to get knowhere in life. Keeping yourself occupied can get you to places in life where you thought you could never be because you are putting the effort. People who move with no purpose are called lazy people these people do not accomplish as much as those who work. Thomas Jeffersom is right to be Idle is wonderful to those who put in the effort and try their best no matter what.

In conclusion, the enthusiasms a tool that will help to grow up and find the way to be a successful person in our life. we learn of the failure and that help to grow up to the hit. For example, to failure give to you a experience and we learn about this experience. Initially, what do we learn about our fall that will help us to find out what do we want in our life. Also, we need to decide what do we doing, if we give up and loos our enthusiasm or stand up and continues until we reach the hit. Then, failure is not always a bad thing pass in your life sometime we need failures in life to find out our ways to where we want to be. In summary, success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because the enthusiasm is a good reason to stay in what do you doing and never give up when the failure come. Another reason is we learn of the failure and that help to decide in what we want to do in our life. Also, most of the people want to be in the hit and no is only won no to be in the hit also need some failure for learn about the experience that the fall give us. For this reason Im agree with Churchill""s statement and is our decision to loss the enthusiasm or stay with the same enthusiasm that we has before of the failure. Finally, a successful person is not a person that never have a failure and his life the successful person is one person that have many fairule and his life but he never loss his enthusiasm on what he want to be.",4,6,5,4,5,5,320,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 4"
604,2168,410957337087,"Distance learning In century twenty-first the education in United states and another countries became better that before thanks to technology. Moreover, the technology helps schools to teach their students with a better way. Now, classes are created creative and effective. The schools had been creating different programs such as ""Distance learning"" to offer a different option to students. This is a program that help students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Therefore, there is a question that every body is making Is the distance learning a better option?. As all programs, it has many advantages. The benefits of this program are following: Anytime class: you do not need to wake up very early in morning, you will be able to attend classes anytime that you consider best. No drive: you do not need drive to school or anywhere, you will skip the traffic. Comfortable: it will be comfortable, because you will stay in the comfort of your house. Work and study: you will be able to work and study at same time, because you can attend classes anytime that you want. No bullying: you do not have to suffer bullying from anybody in school anymore.

Sociable life: you will lost a sociable life in school, because you will stay in home. No books: you do not have all the books to study. Depression: you will pass for a depression that could be caused from being locked in home. Well, is the distance learning a better option?. In conclusion, in my personal opinion it is. I think that this types of programs will be useful and success. There are many peoples that needed programs as this, because they does not have full time to go to school. Those people that need work and study at same time, because they do not have all the resources or money. This programs was created for all you, people that can not go to school.

Working as a team to see the different points of view of everyone is fun,and it helps for the project. This is fun because you get to help friends out, and do experiments with chemicals. Presenting the the project would make you nervous if your by your self if you did it in a group its gonna be fun and also more easy. Working on a project with friends is always gonna be fun specially on a science one because you have to repeat the project three times to make sure it gives the same result every time and its super educational to do. The chemicals you use during a project could be dangers but at the same time they could be fun to use. This is an educational fun project because you get to see how the reaction of different chemicals. The most fun part of a project is that you get to repeat things more then once in order to get the correct results is the most fun thing during a project testing out stuff.

Iam pretty sure that student would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because youre attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like. Student would get benefits in many ways. If they study from home and if they also go to the normal school they can graduate much early than the usual. They can find a job too, if they organize their time wisely. If they have a job so they could earn money and they can use to pay college. If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success. My conclusion is yes student get benefits in many ways when they take classes from home. and I think that every school should have the option to choose if the students wants to take online classes, and also is a good idea to help the student to be more success in the life. :)",6,7,7,6,7,6,1100,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

My second reason is when the student is taken online classes he just going to finish, he no going to learn because he dont care learn he just going to complete the leasons but just that, why? because he dont have the teacher who explaing when he have questions or when he is interesting in something of the class he no have the teacher who know more abaut that.

I was playing and did not know what I was doing I didnt know how to build or shoot or run i didnt even know where I was at , I started playing more often and got my first win with my friends and then I started learning how to build and strategies to get kills, but i honestly didnt like it so I stopped playing for a while and played different games that I liked more because this game seemed to childish for me to play. After a while my friends would tell me to play so I would but I got bored and played different games, then a new season came out on the game and I had money so I bought it and after that everything changed. I really started to like it now because it had a good storyline and it was more fun, I knew how to play so I would just goof around then I really started to practice with my friends and decided to stop playing around we would fight one on ones to practice i would lose but i just kept going and going until I would get more kills now ive been playing for 7 seasons which is a very long time, seasons are usaually 60 to 80 days in the game they arent like seasons in real life like spring or summer their like tv shows how they have new seasons and stuff like that. Anyway I do agree Emersons statement because on how much better at I got at the game and how long ive been plaiying and the experience I have in that game, I started out really bad at it than started getting better and better the more I practiced and played.

One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people wont. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice. Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it. Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing.

Ive learned that with my mom,she always tells me,""you choose to be happy,sad,angry"" Sometimes our character is formed by influences beyond our control,and thats okay everyone has diffrent reasons to be mad or to be sad,happy but we can change it if we want to. The British naturalism and politician John Lunnock was right about what he wrote,this helps a lot of people to understand that if someone do,did,say,or have said something to you ,itll be our choice to get mad,sad,or just ignore what happened.. After that your character itll be what you choose to make it.

618,2182,54304ACFE477,"when were born we come out of our mothers womb, the first thing we naturally do is screech and cry, and if we dont cry the doctor hits us on our backs and trys to make us cry. And from that cry on we develop our own kind of sound and our own screech with its own pitch. They take our fingerprints where there will never be two of the same, even when were born with our twin it will never be the same no matter how much alike we are. from there on we start to learn and develop our own persona. After were born our brain starts to function even with little stuff, babies learn to cry when theyre hungry, want to be changed, when theyre in pain or simply want attention. When children get older into the toddler stage they start to learn how to walk by observing everyone else they learn to talk by listening to everyone else around them. We learn how to grab our bottle, pick up a fork or spoon, and practically our own daily doings. But we learn all that from observing and listening to everyone else. When we hit our 6-12 years of age where we have a tendency that we want to fit in be in the cool kids group and we watch TV see celebritys see that there are musicians, actors, painters, policeman, firemen, dentist, doctors, mayors chefs, soccer players, basketball players, football players, baseball players, hockey players, tennis players, volleyball players etc the list could go on and on, but the point here is the fact that we influences. But as we get older in our teen years 13-19 we start to have our own kind of voice at least until were old enough to make them, we all take our own paths and we choose to make the decisions that we make, our parents dont go with us throughout the day telling us what to do or not do making our each and every decision for us, they sure do give us a hell of advice because they already went threw that stage and they dont want to see fail and get hurt but sometimes its good that we fail and make mistakes because then we learn what we can or cannot do. Now as you turn into an adult that net that we used to have when we were living under mom and dads roof is no longer there its gone we dont have that privilege anymore, and we need to grow up and create and develop our own persona officially. when you get a job it comes with responsibilities and from there we learn if were responsible or irresponsible, if were social or non social if were lenient of non lenient, patient or impatient, forgiving or unforgiving. Id like to think that were all born to grow and learn about our rugged society, and based on what weve lived is how were going to act because we can literally live in a shit hole of a place and have the happiest attitude ever and have a better attitude then a boy or girl complaining that she didnt get the car she wanted, verses the kid that saw his mother get beat by his dead beat dad or the kid that was up all night wondering if his mom was going to come home tonight or even the kid that went to sleep hungry. So honestly i dont think that were born with labels i feel like we all can make our own decisions of what were going to make of life, if your going to sit there and make everyone see you as a pity. A huge play of your character is your mentality is you have a broken done weak mindset your going to have negative vibes and weak dead beat character, but if you have a strong mindset and the will to get stuff done then youll have a broad and respected character.

When i read this statement I see that saying because you cant give up you got to keep trying to get what you want. Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time. Last, Someone cant lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it.

For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace. Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life. Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes youll need a buddy to help out or youll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong. Youre not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, theres a point in time where youve got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but youve got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"". Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day.

If the school board adds hours it will become a disaster for the students that have a job and need to get there in time also if they live far from their job their boss could get mad at them for being late and if they dont belive their worker they could get fired and then the student wont have a job, they wont get paid, and they wont have money to pay for what they need.

Although some say that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy because we dont use our resorces and energy in vain , actually my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two school hours to conserve resorces and energy because we will have a better environment and we will administrate energy. Those who believe that my school should not adopt a four-day of school week and should not extend two hours of school day to conserve resorces and energy have their reasons. One of the most disputed reason is that, our school does not use it resorces and energy in vain, beause we use energy and resorces to facilitate our studies and to have better opportunities to learn. And they also say that if we have a four-day school week wont make any change. However, my school should adopt a four-day school week and extend two hours of school day because we will have a better environment.

Even more, it says that because the over abuse of resorces in our school the amount of trees cutted has enhace around our county and its harming our enviroment."" That is giving a bad reputation to our school and county because our school does not recycle and reused our resorces .

629,2193,DAE1AA29184B,"Should Generic_School extended school days by two hours for four days a week? My opinion about this is we shouldnt let this happen for many reasons for example; Students would be waking up late,People got jobs after school and responsivbles after school, Students wouldnt have time to do homework and actives after school. Having to go to school for four days would be great and all but I would rather go to school for that extra day then just four days for ten hours. Other people would agree with me and my reason why we shouldnt let this happen. Ill give you more detail reasons about why we shouldnt let this happen. My first reason, Students would be waking up late to school, Its very important to go to school and people waking up late could cause a lot of problems with the government and with parents. The student attendance would drop a lot, Students would be waking up later on in the day, And would be missing a lot of class work in the moring that could be important. That they would have to make up which could be hard because they would have to stay after for school if we would have ten hours of school and it would be hard to do it in class. If we didnt have two hours added to are day then it would be much easier to stay after school, And students would be waking up on time and going to school more often. Next reason,Some students have jobs after school and responsivbles. If we would have ten hours of school it would be impossibe to take care of those thing. Having a job is important some students could be going through tuff times like family issues,Some students even have kids to take care .Some students got a lot to handle that and school work and going to school. Other students they got other thing to do for example vist people family members,having chores to do around the house. Now,My last reason would be students wouldnt have time to do homework and actives after school. There are alot of students who stay after for help with there homework, Clubs and sports,some students enjoying staying after and practicing to join the soccer team,foorball team etc. Students even have time to work on there homework when they get out of school. If we would have added two more hours then we wouldnt have sport or staying after, It would probably be late and teachers dont want to stay longer then they should and parnets could get worryed about the kids for staying longer. These actives could affect students class work, How tired the students get and sore when they come back from school. In conclusion, We shouldnt add two more hours to the school day for four days a week it could affect students attendents and how they act with others,People have jobs and responsivbles after school and students actives and homework. Thats why we should keep the school days nomal and how long we stay in school. Students come to school on time and prepare to learn. They do want they have to do after school and everyone is happy with that,Others will be unhappy if we would add two more hours to are day.",7,6,6,6,6,6,3080,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
630,2194,332F7B4392BA,"Former BirtishPrime Minister Winston Churchill Once Said That ""Success Consists Of Going From Failure To Failure Without Loss Of Enthusiasm"". In my opinion, the former Birtish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement, saying that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Because in life, before you achieve any of your dreams or goals, youve to pass through some difficulties. Some people may disagree with Winston Churchill saying because theyve not experince any hardship, or any failure in life before. The reason is because they were born with silver or gold spoone in their mouth. They dont even know how hard ship is or looks like. Those people have no idea how it feels to be a failure, or a loser, or to even loss enthusiasm in life. Even though, some of them are rich today, but they when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and they even lost hope in themselves to the point that they couldnt believe that they will make it in life because of the stuggle or hard ship they when through. In addition, failure plays an important roles in our pursuit of success. The reason Im saying this is because if you dont have any experince of failure or without the loss of enthusiasm, you wont know the important of that wealth you have or your parents has. For example, my mother once told me her story that when she was in Africa in my country Liberia, she when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and hard ship during the civil war and after the civil war. According to my mother, she said things was really hard on her, and she said that she had no one to helped her to the point that she used to asked people in the community for food to eat just so she and my oldest sister can be able to salveged from hunger.

Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years.

There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age. The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes.

On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you.

To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end.

For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza. It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesnt even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If thats the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, its not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do. In reality, it really doesnt matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still wont bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before its not best thing in the world. So its okay dont waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start. Just bring your own food from home and you wont have worry about the school menu. ",6,6,8,7,7,6,3220,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
636,2200,C57371A3E79F,"I agree with Emersons statement about individuality. It is find for me that I can be myself in a world. Im thinking that the world is trying to make me who I am and make me see. the way I am can make me do whatever I want to do. I could visit wonderful places like seeing great nature, going into a big forest, and go see big hills. this would be amazing to see wonderful things. I can be myself in a world when it is constantly trying to make me something seeing things like a place to see nature. Sometimes in some places to see nature is amazing. Seeing nature like seeing different kinds flowers, and seeing and beautiful. I will also went to see the blossom trees. Those would be interesting for me to see those kinds of Nature. I would think about in a world and it would constantly make me something else when seeing nature a big forest. Going into the forest usually it is just trees, but when I see something new in the forest, it would be very interesting. I would see in the forest that the life is changing. Also I would see fresh fruit growing from the trees. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes. Sometimes I think in a world that makes me something else wants me to see everything. This can maybe explain that I am on top of a mountain or a hill. Hills would be better for me because I just only want to see a high view of the land, with the mountains it is too cold and windy. When I see big hills usually it is just grass. Going up to the top of a big hill and When I see that this land is clear, this may explain that theres only a plain grass area with trees, this is similar to the past a long time ago. It is good for me to be who I am, and being myself in a world. This may explain almost everything. Saying that I disagree with this statement thinking that It doesnt seem very interesting, it may feel like Emersons statement doesnt make any scents. For me this statement makes scents, because it does describe the world that is trying to make me something else about the greatest accomplishments.

637,2201,CBFEE0C81C5E,"Its not a good idea for students to identiify a career by the time they enter high school. The three reasons are because it can cause to much stress on the student, they wont be able to focus on their school work, and it can unmotavite them to succesed in their careeer. If the student is expected to identify a career by highschool it can affect how their doing in school becuse all they will be thinking about is a career to pick. They wont focus on their work in class or pay attention in class which will make them fail and slump the class. That can unmotavite them and they can stop showing to school and drop out. Those are my reasons on why I think making a student choose a career by highschool is bad. Others might argue that a student who has a career in mind by the time they enter highschool will succesed because they know what they want to do in life. It will guide them to success in the future, they will have all highschool to study about their career they chose. However, that might work on some students but it wont work on all bacause not everyone knows what they wanna be in life. Some drop out of school cause of the stress it puts on them and just start working to make money. Those are my reasons why I think we shoudnt pressure students on choosing a career so early in high school.

638,2202,56C4259AA5C2,"Is always good to try new ideas, I disagree with Emersons statement. Nobody can tell you if you can do something or if you cant, the unique that can stop you is yourself. Learning new thinks help us to recreate our minds, help us to make new projects in life or work, help us to create new ideas and most of the time we can have fun. Also try to do something more besides you career will help you to have more options of work and more possibility to have a better economic situation. In fact, it will help you to be responsible in all the staff that you do daily, in your home, in your job, in the school, with you friends, etc. It will prepare you for what is coming in the future and it will help you get mature mentally. However, take two or more careers at the same time can harm you, and make harder you progress in your main career. For example: I got a friend his name is Generic_Name, hes taking film producer career, he needs to take those classes for almost three more years. In addittion, he started to do photography career like two months ago. He really like both careers, and Generic_Name think that if he take both careers at the same time it would be easy in the future for get a better work and make more money. But he realize that it will be really hard to do both careers at the same time, he began to feel the stress and the pressure that he will no do it really good on both careers. He realize that it was really complicated and that he was losting his time and his money on something that it wouldnt end really good. Then my recommendation was to finish first film producer career because it was the career that he really wants to finish first, it was his dream to be a film producer and make some movies, we always talked about this. So I said first you need to finish film producer career and after that, it will be better to take photography career like second choice. Anyways, Generic_Name was really frustrated because he thought that he will do it really well, but his mistake was that he didnt organize his time and his life; thats what happen with most of the people that think that do more than one career is impossible, and is not that, is just that you need to organize yourself and your time. After that Generic_Name understood that do easch career at the time it would be better and he decided to start with film producer first and add Photography career after two more years. In Conclusion, take two different careers or masters are not a problem, you just need to organize your life and check what is the priority for you, it doesnt matter how long you take, in a future you will see all the benefits that you are going to have, how you grow up and how you can be an example for other people that think ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have alredy mastered, you will never grow up"", if you try to do something beyond what yopu have already mastered it probably being easier, but that doesnt mean that if you do another career you will not be a successful person. Finally you just need to demostrate that you effort and you sacrifice is going to be for something better in your life.",8,6,8,6,6,6,1119,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then youll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear. most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go. when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.

If all the schools are agree about to extending two hours more, then they are braking the rule to converse more energy and resources. It is a lot of things that schools can use and the principal thing that school are using is energy. In the school office all the teachears are working all the time making copies, works and they are doing a lot of files. Second, its not necessary to extending two hours more in the schools, students can do campaigns to how reduce the energy or making groups of people and try to do things that help to conserve more energy. In this case we can created proyects that help better to try to not spend a lot of energy in fact to try to conserved. And then conserve some of energy. Third, some of the students can created devises for extract the solar energy and used. Teachers can help to support to the students creating more ideas or proyects. Maybe is not going to change as how much energy we are using, but it is some that helps to reduce the energy, the point is to try to conserve the energy that we are using.

The people that say yes they say that because when you know what career you want to take before entering high school you wiil choose you classes better depending in your career and what high school you want to attend because come schools have programs that count like college classes, and in high school you have only four years and that is not enough time for you to choose and you will end up in a carrer that you dont like if you choose the wrong one. If you know what you want to be you will cofus better in that career . You can join programs to help you more in your goals and when you know your goals you can achive them better. You also will try to see how can you get a scholarchip for your carrer and what college are better for you, and you will mead people that like the same thing as you and you can make friends. When you join programs some time you can get a scholarchip if you are good. For example my friend want to join the army so he is taking jrotc to help hem do better in the army but my other friend wants to do soccer for college so he is taking advance p. e. to be in shape and he is also in the school team to get a scholarchip, and me Im taking business classes to help me know more about business marketing because I want to put my own store and Im putting everything of me to do that because that is my goal and i want to do the best of me in that project of my life. People that say that you dont have to know what you want to be before you get in to high school. They say that you can join different programs and see wich one you like the most and you will choose your career from that decition and you will know whats about because some people choose careers that they dont like them maybe because they dindt know the stuff you have to do or they dindt expect to be like that. Is better to waste four years then wasting your entire live in a career that you dont like. you sholl try to get a scholarchip that way you dont pay for college. If you dindt have a scholarchip and finish college and you are working in a career that you dont like and you dindt have a sholarchip you are going to be in debt and you are going to pay alot. If you only study for one year in college and you fell like that career is not for you you have to play for that year and is not cheap so you have to choose your career when you are in high school and see whats about before entering and if you like it because if you dont like that career you are going to waste your time. For example I dindt know what career I like before high school so I join jrotc and i dindt like it and a teacher told me to take business classes and I like it so I chose to do business for my career. In conclution both of them are good options but if you know what you want to be before high school you can see whats that carrer is about in high school and if you dont like it you can change it and the other one you will have more chooses because you will not focus in only one career you will see more oportunitis. Is depending in the choose you make. All of thise dipend in how you are because evryone is defferent and not everyone is going for the same opsion. But for both of them you have to do your best in school to achive your goal and get a schoolarchip that way you dont pay for college. But first of all we have to finish high school and get good greads. and remember that is only one life so do your best and try to live the life that you want and dont let others tell you that you cant do something just belive in your self and that will be a big change adn wen you are in college do your best and do your work and life the live chill.",7,4,5,6,6,6,1101,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 7"

I would love to go and have a position there. Im interested to give it a try in your business. A professional like you can teach me how everything works and how you maintain everything under control with your employees. Also, it be delightful if i could ask questions about how is it difficult to be such a big person as a manager? Therefore,I choose your company because I feel like its great for me to start working in a place that i could be conformable with. And specially if its from a company with great quality and management. Also i can learn how to socialize with people. Learning how to communicate is important for a company so everything is in order. Some companies dont know how to communicate and to be organize. Theyve to be anti-social so they can focus on their work and not on other employees otherwise theres consequence. Some companies are very strict with their employees. For examples employees have to be obedient to every single thing. As in theyve to follow every step correctly or they would get fired or worst. Thirdly, Your company is understandable to your employees. You treat them with respect and love as if they were your family. I heard that if your employees had a emergency you would be generous and support them no matter what. I never heard one complain from your company either. However, its the exact opposite. people who works there seems to love it and to enjoy it! Theyve learned to be responsible and respectful in your company. You also are fair with your employees. Employees in that company gets payed well with no complains. They get payed exact the hours theyve been working. However, the way you manage your customers is incredible. Your customers are never disappointed what they order is exactly what they get. Employees always have a smile on their faces when receiving a customer. Theyre always gentle and polite. But more importantly patient because theyre a lot of customers who are slow or aggressive, they like to get attention. As great employees they handle any challenges. And i think its a perfect start for me because Ill do everything right with no excuses. In the other hand, your company is always nice and neat you make sure that the place looks good and prepared just in case important visitors come to visit your company. Mean while, i think the environment needs more companies as an this one. because everything about this company is splendid and spectacular. Theyve great service and employees. They make sure their customers come in and out happy. Your company takes responsibility for any errors that could happen. You also give great deals for customers. you teach your employees have to be a great worker. You give your employees plenty of time to get along with their job because you know that in the future they will do way much better. You also persuade your employees that they can do anything. That giving up is not a answer. I would like to be a outstanding person for your company. I want to tell everyone about how amazing your company is and how wonderful everyone who work there is. The organization in your company is great you keep everything in order. In conclusion, I think i am very interested in learning about your company more and actually try to work there. I want to feel that joy and that responsibility i have to have. I want to spend time learning and practicing in your company. Your company has shown me that not all companies are bad as they say nor terrible. In my opinion i think companies should be more like this one. So if i could get the opportunity to go and check it out and learn that would be amazing. Because i never heard of a company this generous before. And i would definitely would love to know more about it. Everything about your company is great for example communication,organization,employees and deals. It sounds entertaining and enjoyable. This is a enormous deal for me. So Mr. Manager i would like to go and visit it.

I do not know if I going to change it again, because I can be a undecided person. As well, I realized that happens every time that it was normal. I talk with my classmate, and they say that same thing happen with them. Although some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career, actually it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study. Some say that is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can select courses in their high schools to help them improve in their right career. The only problem is that they do not know that is a problem for students. Everyday I heard students, classmate or even my friends that said This class is really hard for me, but I can not change it because this class help me improve my career"". That words make me think that they are unhappy and stressful. The best way to help students is that they can change a new career. Maybe that career that they are starting are not for them or students can be undecided in what they want to study, and they just pick one. There is a lot of reasons why is a bad idea that students commit to a career at a young age, but I just have two of them. In addition, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them. The dream of all kids it is to be like their parents. They want to study the career that their parents studied, even go to the same university they parents go. Sometimes is different their parents put pressures on them to studied a career that they dont want. So, students chose the career that their parents studied or they parents wants them to study . Then they realized that the career they pick is not right for them. This is a problem because now students are unhappy and stressful. Sometimes they wants to quit school because they think school is hard for them. When is just because they pick the wrong career. If someone do a statistic about how students feel about their career that they chose. I think the probability of that students said that they think the career they pick is not for them will be above of one hundred percent. Also, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students can be undecided in what they want to study. There are a lot of career that students can pick, it is difficult just pick one. Students can find skills that help them in another career. Even though their skills are good in the career they pick before. They decide to pick another career. Sometime the decision that students takes are not the right one, but they continue experiment new careers. That is basically life is about, decision. When students takes a wrong decision in their careers. they are learning. Maybe students decides to learn two careers or more than two they take different course or classes to achieves their goals. I think students can be undecided in what they want to study and that is the best thing that help them in their career, is good that students can experiment different courses. In conclusion, it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because students might select a wrong career that is not right for them and students can be undecided in what they want to study. Sometimes students can be very impulsive and can chose whatever career they want, but they not realize what career is the right one. Also, students sometimes could not decide what career they want to study. The best way to help students is to let them know what they want to learn.

Their opion is very important because they will be working for an extra two hours each day but they will also have one more week day free. After school hear their opinion then school should make the decision about adopted a four-day work week. In my opinion as student I could said that this is not a good idea, because we will have to stay for an extrea two hours in the same place which would not be good for students, be at school for 8 hours is hard for us and I could not imagine be there for a longer time. Although we will have an extra day for be with our family and do homework or any other assignment but whatever we still do all those things with the two day we have now. Shool should also consider that some teachers and worker members have their kids and they cannot be with their babysitter for a ten hours. They need to be with they family after school and do others things. Stay for two more hours will be very stressful for everyone. School will use the same amount of energy, because they will be using a energy for two more hours each day which is equivalent if they reduced the five-week day to four-week day. The same amount of energy will be used in both ways. Make a new change will afect not only at school it will also afect society. Everyone is adapted to the sistem as it is now if thre is any change there will be needed new rules for example what students will be doing two more hours in school or what we are suppose to do with an extra free day during the week. If students have an extra day doring the week will not be beneficiary, because they can use these time to play video games or spend their time doing things that are not good for them. If school approved the new model they will need to raise the works wages for the two more hours of work in each day which will count as over time, because the legal hours per day for a person should work is just eight hours. In fact they will be paying more money compare to the money they are paying now. Now they are just are not paying over time. The eschool should not be adopted this new model, because they will be using more resources. In my opinion school definite should not adopted the new model, because there are more disadvatanges than benefits. If any other school have not done before is because it is not good for students. The new chage is not neceessity for our school. The same energy will be used and there will be more resources used. For some businesses might work but it wil not work for our school.

Failure is a really strong word that nobody likes to like that hear some students get upset for failing a test or class they cant be late because they want to win is just like work if you want to start getting paid more you always gotta be on time and all that. so you can become better everyday. Soccer is one example about success soccer you got to learn a lot of new stuffs, Because you have to do a lot of practice. To win you gotta do something,and do it right all time. We all hate failing I hate failing, I always think that is just a waste of time. I fail so many times but i never give up because I know that I gotta finish what I started ow you are going to success Enthusiasm thats whats the way to success on your dreams if never use that enthusiasm to do something you are going to be good at it you might fail more than ones but still think about what is going to give you. And just think positive that you are gone be sussefull. Lets said that i m trying to go to collage and I stared to work and stared to get a lot of money and all that. then I think about going back to collage and think of all the work that they do and all that im not going to keep going. Because I lost the enthusiasm that i had. Why because I stared to get more stuffs, and I wont feel success Thats why i agree with what The britishs prime minister Winston Churchill said. That to get where you what you got to fight. And never give up on whats coming next yeah some times you going to fail but get up and keep going so you can be success and become better and always have a good enthusiasm on your life because every body deserves to be success. never lose your your enthusiasm because thats your key to success.",4,4,6,5,5,4,2428,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

It is tired and hard to help other people, but assist make people glad. My ability is I can speak Korean, acquired Korean by reading the books, can use my skill usefully by teaching Korean to Korean - American and communicate and help Korean. I developed my Korean skill by reading books often. I read a Korean book at least in a week. Mostly, it was hard to understand and I had to find the words meaning in every single time. However, I could improve my writing skills, vocabulary skill and I could speak Korean and write logically. For example, I took World Language Exam last year, I could use the words that I saw when I was reading a book. Also, I could make my writing clearly, organize and I understood prompt very well. In addition, my parents read Korean books to me and my brother. That made me to understand and speak in Korean fluently. I can use Korean skill very usefully by teaching Korean to Korean- American. Usually, people who were born in America but their families are Korean, and they dont know how to write, speak and write in Korean. For example, I go to the church every Saturday and help to teach Korean to the teenagers or children. It is hard but they can learn Korean from Korean school and communicate with families. For example, they become teenagers, and they can speak only English and their parents can speak only Korean. They will not able to communicate each other. They will become farther. Nevertheless, teenagers can ignore their parents that they cannot speak English. Communicate with Korean can be useful because some Korean are immigrated to America with not enough English skills. They need help with bills, housing and information of America. If you go any stores or community center, they are having difficult because they cant speak English so they cannot understand what the owner is trying to say. If you can speak Korean, you can help them. For example, I was student ambassador which is help new students to touring the school and help them with the schedule. The new student came to our school and she was Korean and she cannot speak English. I introduce the school, and class schedule in Korean to her so she can understand about school system. There are lots of advantages if you speak another languages. You can acquire Korean by reading books that help to improve your writing, reading, vocabulary skills. Also,teaching Korean to children or teenagers and can communicate with Korean can help people. ",6,6,6,5,5,7,756,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
652,2216,FBE180CF324E,"To begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? When two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because People are probably not themselves, People opinion change, People never have the same intellectual connection. For example Generic_Name went to the movies with his girlfriend Generic_Name, his mom Generic_Name, and his sister Generic_Name. Generic_Name tells Generic_Name to invite her boyfriend Generic_Name. Generic_Name interaction with Generic_Name was unpleasant, based on what Generic_Name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. Days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what Generic_Name thought at first and what she thinks now. Secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. Their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. Why? First because they are starting to get to know new people. Second they have no idea what to expect from people. Third, some people do above and beyond to impress. Now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. Sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. Society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are. However, peoples opinion change from time to time. Visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. We end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? It means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. We might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self dont have that confidence. For example Generic_Name was mad at Generic_Name for not going to the bank with her. So Generic_Namea said that they would no longer be friends. The next day she text her and said what time am I picking you up. Their was a change of opinion from night to morning. Lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. When you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. For example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. When two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. People would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person. In conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because People are not themselves, People opinion change, and People never have the same Intellectual connection. Peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. First impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job , friendship, or to be a partner. Society now in days have to look out more to make sure everythig is in order. Thats why we have people who do research and look back to records, thats why jobs and people have a process of doing things.

653,2217,55C7EC027A88,"Lately many people have said students should have a shorter summer vacation about 45% of people have. They think it would be better for students so they dont forget what they learn the year before when the come back in the fall. They think students should have year-round schools, but is that a really good idea? Well here are many reasons why there shouldnt and why it would be a horrible idea. Many people think that students shouldnt have to year-round schools because the students might have a summer job, Its no enough time, they shouldnt have to worry school for that long, and its just too many things for them to remember. Many students normally middle schoolers and high schoolers have to work during the summer. Many students have to work after school and its just to much for them. Some might work because the need to help their families with money, others to buy something they really want or need, and some is so when they get out of high school and they can have enough money to get into collage. Whatever the reason may be they need the three month summer vacation so they can have more money to do whatever they need with it and have a year-round school will not help them because after work they need to do homework. About 85% of students that work and have go to go school will have to stay up really late so they can do thier homework. Students often do not get enough sleep. They stay up late night hours doing homework , project or studying. In reality its just too much work for students to keep up with school for that long. A three to four weeks for summer vacation is just not enough for students, not even teachers. They deserve a longer summer vacation after all the hard work they have done for those nine months, the least they could get is a three month vacation. They just need to relax and take care of themselves because they sometimes be stressing out too much. Which that could lead to bad health and many other problems. They need a longer vacation because three to four week is not enough. What if they want to travel they cant not for long so they cant really enjoy it. They also need to spend more time with their families, many just dont be as close to them because they are too focus in school. They just a well needed vacation of no more stress for three months. Another reason why a year-round school is not the greatest idea is that its just too much for students and teachers to remember. Students already need to remember a lot to pass the SOL. Having a year of school will just keep adding too that. Its also a lot of work for students to be doing. A lot of worksheets, tests, quizes, projects, and for teachers too they need to be planning the next class and need to be grading a lot of papers. Plus another thing to think of is what about summer school? For the students that didnt pass the SOL or the class. When or how will they have the time to pass? Theres a lot of things that should be planned out first. On the other hand I get why it would be nice to be in a year-round school. Students wouldnt forget as much things. Normally when students come back in the fall they are clue-less of what the learned three months ago. A year-round school will decrease that. Students would also get to see their friends more. Often many students dont get to see their friends during summer vacation. For the students that need it, they could get extra help. Also for the students that really like to learn new things this would be a great time too. However even though all that would be kind of nice. We dont know if the decrease of students forgetting things will actually work because not many students even touch their backpack during any vacation so they would most likely will forget a lot of things either ways. Nowdays even though students might not see their friends. They still manage to text or facetime. Maybe some students might have a car and will be able to go vist them or hang out for a bit. If students need extra help they can get a tourter for that extra help that they may need and if we have a year-round school for them it wouldnt be fair for the other students that do not need that extra help. If they really want to learn new things they can go to classes somewhere for whatever they would like to learn. Its just more better having a three month break. Thats why there shouldnt have a year-round school there just wouldnt be much of benefits. Itll most likey stay with the same problems or even worse. Thats why there should be a year-round school because students might have a job, its not enough time for them, they shouldnt have to worry about school for that long, and they just would have to remember too many things.",8,7,8,8,7,6,1112,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
654,2218,4800E073664A,"I do agree with what Ralph Emerson wrote. Being myself in a world that is being nonstop trying to make you something else that is not you, is a very good accomplishment youve overcome. There is always challenges in life where you would have to be yourself. If you cant be yourself then you should ask for advice from your family on how you can be yourself. If you arent yourself and youve become different from yourself and its not always good. Its like letting the world win by changing you. You should always be yourself no matter what you come across, listen to you and your family, and dont lose to the world by not being yourself. In life no matter what you come across, you should always be yourself. Dont let anyone force you to be someone else because you might not even like who youve become. People who arent themselves usually are going through some serious stuff or just want attention. Being yourself is really hard when there are hard challenges you have come across that tries to make you different from yourself. Being yourself is the best accomplishment you can earn when in a world that is trying to make you something else. You should always listen to yourself and your family. Getting advice from your family is the best because theyve been alive longer than you and have more knowledge in how theyve became there self and not anything else. Listening to yourself is good because youre doing what you want to do, what your mind is telling you. If you become something else and your mind was telling you not to, then you should re-evaluate your thoughts and be yourself. Family are related to you, they have similar mindset as you, and they should understand you more than anyone else in this world. At the end of the day, you know who you are; if you arent yourself its like letting the world win by changing you and losing because you arent yourself. Youre showing us you arent capable of the world, you cant handle the world because youre not thinking about your decisions and letting the world change you. You know what you can do and cant do. If you know you can change then go for it and change. Changing can be hard but you should take it slow, think about what you want to change. Its a great feeling knowing youve changed because you know you have achieved your goal. Ralph Emerson won against the world trying to change him because he realized people change and arent themselves anymore and spoke out. Dont let anything try to change you, you do you.

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students dont have to wait on others to do their work. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three dont do their work. It brings everyone else down.

Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever. These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyones personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into. On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just dont pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different. For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it. These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to.

Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? My position is that we choose our own character traits. Why because Your character will be what you are and who you are. Your charcter will be what you yourself choose to do. A reason is each person has there own way of being who they are. There is diferent types of characters that make each person unique in there own way. I also think that there is character formed by influence. there is alot of character that we can have. Many have very little and many have alot of character. example some people have a very sweet chacter in something they love or some people have a diffrent charcter trait that dont like to show it . character traits is away to show your personality. When you go to a job interview the person that is taking your interview is looking at your characteristic is seeing how you are if you have a good charateristic or if you have a bad charcteristic. You are going to show your chacteristic by the way you inturduce yourself by the way you speak your body laguage. You are going to do what you feel conterble in doing. Many ask you to descibe yourself and by what you say they see if that is your charcteristic. Character Traits are one of the ways that descibe how we are as a person. For example people describe me as a shy person that likes to help that is always offering to help. I also get descibed as a person that gets mad easily but does its best to not show it as much and pretents nothing has happeaned. Thats how some people descibe me. For me charcter traits is something that is you that makes you special in some way. everywhere you go there is going to be someone seing your chacteristic. You make your own chacter, its something you do that describes who you are. Depending in how you feel thats what you going to show which is your charcter trait it all depends in us we make our own character trait in the way we feel and act. its important to always show a good atitud for we can be described in a good way and try to have some good charcter trait for we can have a good reputation in life. For example John Lubbock wrote ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. Is very true we all make our own character and that makes us who we are and is something that makes you speical and the way you are.

Many people when they go out with someone first they ask people what kind of personality that person they are going out with or wanting know. you can tell even by there looks and there body languge what kind of chacteristic they have because everyone makes there own charater.",5,6,7,5,7,5,111,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Conserve energy and resources through this model could be a helpfully way for the school. It can be a support form for the community area. Following this model by extending the school day two hours can be method to conserve energy and resources. First, conserve energy and resources through extend the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need those resources in the community. For example, in the community close to the school live some families with not much resources. They do not have money for pay the energy or buy needs as water or food. The only way that they can have resources as energy is through a big building as a school in the community. In other words, if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours can conserve energy and resources and give to the community as a needs. Thus, through follow the model by extending the school day two hours, the school can give necessary resources for whom need it in the community. Second, conserve energy and resources through the model by extending the school day two hours can be helpfully for the school in emergency situations. For example, at Generic_City occurred a strong earthquake at the beginning of this year.

Actually, Manager should select me because i have positive attitude and i will working hard. First, Some say that you should not select me because i dont like to do extra work. some people exploit yourself when you try to do extra work if you did the first time, so the next time they give you more work to do. However all the people are not the same. For example, my sister work in clean the house she have different type of person, so a women from Generic_City told her to cleaned the toys. My sister just told her OK, but is not her job in the next time she went to clean the women put her to cleaned the garage and she didnt pay. Second, Some say that you should select me because i have a positive attitude. the people that always have positive attitude they will have success in the life. If you fall you have to get up.

670,2234,C454239AC43D,"I dont think our school needs to follow this model by extending school for an extra two hours. We need to be in school for seven days a week to learn and be productive in working on assignments, projects, tests or quizzes. We also be in school to be active in working and socializing with students and teachers. If we are in school for a seven day period, then students and teachers would involved in helping each other more and getting some work done that they were absent for or helping them work they have to turn in or they need help understanding the information they are given. My first reason is that we should be in school for seven days instead of 4 days. If we are in school for seven days, then the students would be learning more about what certain topics the teacher is talking about. Another thing is that students can work hard on assignments that are due within two days or week. Also if they if are absent or just need help , then students can make up work by staying after school to catch on anything they have missed or just come in for extra help if they need it. One example would be if I were absent for like day or more, I could make up the the assignments that I missed by staying after school to make them up. Or having to just coming in to get extra help on assignments that I dont get or having trouble on. My second reason would be that teachers will be there for seven days to help you with anything. If you dont get what assignment is asking or understand it, then a teacher can help you by reading it to you or explain it to you. Teachers will be there everyday to help you with anything that will help you succeed in their class. Also they will be there to help motivate you in getting good grades in any of your classes and passing them. My second example would be If I didnt understand the information or just give up on the assignment, a teacher would be by my side. they would motivate me to never give up and always try to do your very best on any assignment that was difficult for me. My third reason would be students would be engaging with other classmates. Students and classmates dont have to only engaged in helping each other with assignments. During a seven day week, students can talk with their classmates or friends during lunch or if the teacher allows you to talk. Also your classmates or friends would love to ask you if want to participated in after school activities or clubs. My third example would be If my classmates or my friends ask if you want stay after, I would say yes. Then I would get involved with my with my classmates or friends and start talking with them. Some people think that having a four day school week would be better for them. They think if they have school for four days only, they would have nothing worry about. Like for example, they wouldnt worry about much work needs to be done or how the work will affect how they are. Also what grade you will get on a assignment or when to turn in your assignments. Some people think that having a four day school week for be bad for them. Students would be worrying about what they got on a assignment or test. Others would be panicking when to turn in assignments or when you can make up a test or quiz. Like for example, If students only had four school days to turn in assigments or make up a test or quiz, then it make the students feel bad for themselves or they can feel sad and sorry for themselves. Also they wouldnt know how they did on a assignment,test,quiz and what grade they got on it. In conclusion, Students and teachers would much rather a seven day school week then a for four day school week. Then students can work hard on their work, while the teacher will be there to help with help or any questions that you have. Also if the students are having any trouble besides work, then the teacher will be by your side to help you or motivate you to make you feel proud of youself.",8,6,7,8,7,8,2654,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
671,2235,9E2645222231,"Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things. It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they dont use their time wisely. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends. Instead of been idle, why cant we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home. In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they dont want to involve in activities, or interact with people. Idle people are lazy, because they dont want to try out new things. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I dont like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it. As a result of all the reasons and examples. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.",7,7,8,7,6,8,2107,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

We as people have to set goals for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value others, if you dont value yourself whats the point for setting up goals if all they going to do is collect dust. Everybody haves different opinions some people might think the world is at fault for the choices they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say its the other persons fault.

I think thats good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work. When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career. By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career, before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything. Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college. I think thats a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.

679,2243,35A7E263AC71,"the prompt says ""Unless you try something beyond what you have mastered you will never grow"". one would say that is something very wise to say .But due to the lack of wisdom around the world it is basically useless to say anything wise. I personally agree apart from physically growing Im almost done. Going back to the topic I do agree with what author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote, That if you dont try something beyond on what i have mastered am I really growing in any way ? I have try anything new and just do the same routine over and over im not going to make far in life .Although I cant think of a reason why someone would disagree the statement. I have tried many thing my seventeen years of being alive, and I can say I have grown to be the person I am now .Many people dont try new thing only because they are quick to judge on the presentation of the new item or new person , but if people actually gave the new experience a chance it could be life changing for better or worse . So going back to you trying something beyond what i mastered I wont grow or something like that its all in perspective if I wish to try something new and be a better person in society I will but if I wish to not try anything at all and just to the same boring routine day after day .Sooner or later I will get bored of everything .Even though some may argue by saying ""thats how I got successful in the first place by doing the same routine over and over"". In some cases that may work for example in sports the athlete must do the same thing over and over until the get better at the sport or like a dance they practice the same dance over and over until it;s ready to be shared with the world how well one can dance . And for others trying a new routine can lead them to success (well maybe not everyone is talented) In conclusion trying something new does change who you are in a bit by either helping or destroying yourself .People do grow to be wise and old and other dont grow old wise just young and reckless. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson was a wise man to say ""Unless you try something beyond what you already have mastered you will never grow. thank you for taking the time to read this essay .

681,2245,F05D3802BC94,"Last year, a student in my classroom was caught using his cellphone during class. He pointed out that the reasoning behind it was that he was searching something that involved the class, but the teacher still took up his phone. By allowing the use of cellphones in class many students would get even more distracted than they already are. It would also be easier to cheat and get good grades, since all the information would be of easy access. On the other hand, this would make the technological integration in school even better and easier, something that many dream and believe will happen in the close future. I believe cellular devices should not be allowed during educational time. Initially, cellphones would draw too much of students attention. Teenagers spend enough time of their day staring at screens, and school should be a place where that doesnt happen. Many are addicted to social media, and have the ""need"" to check it every 10 minutes. Sometimes when I am in class and decide to take out my phone, not looking and paying to the teacher for more than a minute makes me loose focus of class and need to ask the ones around me for help. Class is a place where students should focus and pay attention, by allowing the use of phones many would get distracted and use it for non-educational purposes which would make learning harder, since this focus should be used on what the teacher is saying instead of what their friends are posting online. Secondly, it would be an encouragement to cheating. With the integration of cellphones in class students would start getting better grades, since many of them would simply Google all of the answers for a worksheet instead of paying attention to the class and answering it based on what theyve learned. This would make so that daily grades get better, but when test day arrives, the student who Googled every answer in the past week would get a bad grade because he didnt really learn anything, all his answers were based on someone or something helping him. This would then encourage cheating, because that student would most likely realize that with the use of his cellphone daily grades were getting better, but when it came down to not using the device his grades would drop. However, it could be helpful and very easy to set up. With limitations in place, like blocking certain apps and websites that have nothing to do with school, cellphones could be useful during educational time. Technology integration in schools is already happening, many give chrome books to students so they can use it during class, but these are expensive and getting one for every student is not always viable. Everyone has a cellphone so there would be no need for extra devices ,since phones have 1000 different uses, including many that could be of help during educational time. The student from my classroom which was caught using his cellphone still uses it during class, he is barely passing that class and complains that the teacher is not explaining something correctly and that is why he has such low grades. But everyone knows the reason he is almost failing is because hed rather stare at his cellphone screen instead of paying attention to the teacher. Cellular devices draw too much of teenagers attention and can also encourage cheating. On the other hand they can be helpful in the right occasion. I strongly disagree with the use of cellphones during educational time and believe they would cause more harm than they would help.",8,8,10,9,10,10,3533,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
682,2246,DE921CECE21A,"Do we accomplish more by constantly doing something? Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believed that more would be accomplished if there was something being done most of the time, I agree with this. Accomplishing a task motivates some people to do more, accomplishing more, It also helps us learn more about ourselves. Although, people believe that being in-active is better because it provides less stress and more free time, It also keeps us from succeeding our daily tasks and influences us to be lazy. Being busy would require us to be awake and alert of what we are doing. In some cases, after finishing up a task, all people want to do is move on and rest. In other cases, people choose to knock out more work that they have in mind. Having this kind of mindset it good, because it allows a person to have more energy and to keep themselves busy. A personal experience would be when I was so tired one afternoon, but I had to keep myself from napping because I had homework due. After I completed that one homework, I was too awake to even sleep; So I decided to knock out other work I had in the meantime. In the end I received a better grade from that class and I had chores finished from that week so I didnt have to do anything in the weekend. To conclude this paragraph, when I accomplished one thing I ended up accomplishing more than I expected. We all have our different ways of living and learning. One way to help you learn more about yourself is by keeping busy. You learn how to manage your own time, you learn about how you react to a hectic environment which can help for future references, and You learn how your own mind works. For example, When I was in my sisters sixteenth birthday party, I also had school to focus on, homework to get done, and Sols to focus on. For me it was a pretty hectic schedule, but I learned how to respond and manage my time. Learning how to manage my time came in handy when my sixteenth birthday came along. Everyone has a different way of living and learning, and keeping myself busy taught me a lot about how I live and learn. Although being in active provides us with less stress and more free time, which is not always a bad thing, It influences us to not only be more lazy, but to procrastinate. To procrastinate put off something that should be done, To leave it for that moment and do it later, as you repeatedly tell yourself, but you occasionally never end up doing it. Procrastination can lead you to become more and more unprepared. Being unprepared isnt the best way to live. Having more free time can have its positive outcomes, but also its negatives. For example, who wants to accomplish nothing now, only to do the same in the future? People may believe being in-active is a better way to live because it relieves you from stress and work, but doing nothing can follow with other bad habits that can lead to worse in your future. In conclusion, we accomplish more by keeping busy. Keeping ourselves busy can help us prepare for our future, and help us learn more about ourselves and how to respond to a hectic lifestyle. Although some people would like to live a lifestyle doing absolutely nothing, that wouldnt be the case for all. Others would prefer to accomplish more by staying active and helping themselves prepare for whatever comes next.

Two-thirds of the students who join an after school activity club are more likely to succeed in academics then students who do not. Schools should establish an after school homework club because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and give students some teaching experience. Firstly, an after school homework club helps students finish their homework in time. Many student get a low grade in their class because of unfinished homework. They were not able to finish their homework because, they did not know how to do it. Teachers do not usually have the time to go through each student, and help them in class, but some teachers volunteer to meet with students who have difficulty in certain subjects in an after school homework club. Joining an after school homework club is a great way to finish your homework in time. Sometimes teacher might even give students some tips and tricks on how to solve a question, that they would not give out in class. My friend Generic_Name used to have a lot of difficulties with his math homework until he joined the after school homework club in our school. He learned many tricks on how to solve a math equation and even taught a trick to solve an ""Integer Slope Inequality"" equation. Moving on, an after school homework club can help students become more socially interactive. While in an after school homework club, you can find students with the same difficulties as you. This will give students something to relate to and not feel out of place. Having group discussions on how to solve a problem and having group projects in your club will also help you be more socially interactive. My friend Generic_Name made many friends by joining the after school homework club in our school, and grew a lot of confidence. He is now much less nervous when talking to people than before. Lastly, homework clubs can give students teaching experience for if they want to be a teacher when they grow up. Students can volunteer to help other students finish their homework in an after school homework club. This will give the student a lot of experience on how to teach, and deal with other students. There is a team of students is our school called the "" Junior Honor Society"", which helps students with academic difficulties every day after school. As a member, I have learned about a lot of ways to teach someone else, and because of my desire to be a teacher one day, this helps me a lot. Schools should establish homework clubs because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and can give students teaching experience.

685,2249,F22B25257E47,"Two minds think better than one. Working with someone else can bring many benefits and opportunities to everyone, but there is many people who prefer to work by their self . working in a group can help to have done everything on time, and we can establish a good environment in the classroom. Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it. Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely. When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there. Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together. But many people are looking where they can work with people from different types of cultures and listen every idea or opinions in life. having someone to work with, can make evening easier than working alone.

First,reason when something person loss manytime something and feel what if continue does again can obtain something good in the future. Because never said end. Second, reason the failure plays inthe life a paper strong in the life of every person in the world. But when any person not try more time that one is clear that is going to failure and never feel what is obtain something good in the futured. The decition every person have nothing can said what try againt. The decition is of your selft. My position is what if I whole my life said not and not continue consist in something never can obtain something. When have the oportunity of obtain something and gain something never say I failure least when have a enthusiasm of obtain. Never person have the right to says you never cant do. forever cave you personas negatives and thoght negative in the life. But every pesona have the right to attain something. For example: I have goals in my life what is gradution and have my diploma and can continue in the college. For can gain this gold and my dream i have enthusiasn and an person positive. Also if I have failure in my gold I have of up and againt. Form not failure has try more of one times. The reasons are clear if an have enthusiasm for something I loss the possible to go back to againt. I also think what the Prime Minister Winstor Churchill loss something for what the that try todo is what the person not continue there are and losss your enthusiasm for something what hill obtain. There are many success about failure but the failure arrive when the problem dont have solution. Becasuse also have the right to fight for obtain the solocion to the failure. When us arrive to the failure have the right of to do again but other form.

690,2254,FE6EC11C8877,"Should you relied on yourself or other about lifes important matters? Its important that people relied on their own instincts and ideas because if we have people picking chooses for others we would have no power on what we want, for example people who learn from them self are more active and confidant then the ones that have to learn from other, and wait for instructions. I belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. My first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. Infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better. My second reason is that if you let others choose for you, you will never learn to deal with hard thinking situations. Also you get to learn more about your self and you get to do stuff your own way and you also learn to love your self from your mistakes. I think that every person should make there own choose when it comes to hard momemts like when my grandma die my parent pick what we was going to do with her, and she didnt go ask some one what to do, no she knew what to do from expiriens of my grate grandma, and thats why some problems have to be dealt by your self. In conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.

Could students benefit by taking online classes from home, Yes I think it would be fantastic idea taking classes from home, it would be a great way to learn without having to leave your house or worrying you wont get to school on time. Home school can get you more prepare by learning and working on time managment,by woking on time managment prepares you for future jobs. For example I have friend that does home schooling she tried going to a regular school but didnt feel comfortable her parents decided to try home schooling, she ended up loving it,she had more time do other activities, its a great idea because you could prevent bullying from happening. Imagen not having to leaving youre home, students would have more energy because they wouldnt be as exausted. Cerain students have walk miles not matter the bad weather. If students take online classes they could get more sleep and finish there work faster. students would be able to concentrate. In school you get distracted a lot because you have friends next to you trying to talk or make caos also interupting the class. Not having energy for school is a big factor specially for student who work and walk to school in the mornings. if student dont have the enery to go to school learn they would not be able to get good grades. a clear example is myself having to wake up every morning at seven am and walking thirty min to school and also working every day is exausting not matter the weather. Its really hard trying to stay awake in the mornings after walking a certain distance. Thats why i would prefer online studying as well it would change my life completely and i would feel more ready to do work. in conclusion online classes is a great way to study if you dont feel comfortable going to school. I would take online clases its less tiring its a great rest having the time to do my work from home and expirience a new way to study.",6,6,6,6,6,4,117,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The school menu repeat the same food every day. For example,the students are boring that school lunch menu dont change the food for a better that the students can be satisfy. First at all,some of the students skip classes just to go to buy good food outside the school. In addition,would be great if the department that make the menus can approve for the people who work in the cafeteria to give a good food that can help student to dont sleeps during the classes and have energy when the classes start and they can put attention. Also,changing the lunch menu the student can attend to the school every day because some of the students dont come to the school because they dont like the type of food that they give. In conclusion,for benefit of the student would be a excellent reason to change the school lunch menu. In the school lunch menu there are food that contain a lot of grease. For example,that type of food with grease can make the student get sicken. Moreover, the grease can be accumulate and affect the heart of some of the student. Also, there are more possibility the the system of the stomach be affecting,the the amount of grease that is use in the food. In other hand, the grease can make the student be obese there are many case in school there are a lot of student obese because the food that school provide contain to much grease. In conclusion,All the food that is in the school menu can cause several problems for the students. While other argue that change the lunch menu is a good idea,but there are other argue that change the lunch menu is not a good idea because there are some student that have a favorite food from the menu and they want the menu to stay the same. Although this might be valid, there are several important idea to considered,such as,some of the student pay there food but the food is not good enough. For example,some of the student buy the food in here of the school because they to have energy to made all the classes. So, They dont eat at home because there are not a lot amount of time so they decide to came to eat to the school but there is not a good food. However,sometimes the lunch food is costly but there are time the food is not full cook. In conclusion,the student pay the food to eat because is important to be healthier. The school dont change the food every weak and same day they have the same food. On the other hand,there are food that are not healthier for the student to consume. At the end, to have a good care for the student there need to be a good food.

693,2257,57A750437C3A,"Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment"" I agree because if you do everything by yourself better things happens. Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own. First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it. Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesnt work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it. Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem thats why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. Thats doesnt mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do. In conclusion, doing yourself can make you better and open opportunites the you never imaginate. Try to do something the you love or like thats a good way to start to be yourself.

696,2260,A10E91E49973,"Yes, I do believe that imagination is important more than our knowledge. Albert Einstein is recognized as the most brilliant person who has ever lived. He used his imagination more than his knowledge, which made him accomplish so many things. He imagined things first, then used his knowledge to make that happen. If we couldnt imagine things, it wouldve been difficult for anyone to invent something or do a lot of things. All the inventors, who has invented things first used their imagination to create an image on their mind to see how it will look like, which helped them to make the item. Imagination helps us to accomplish our goal. It shows us what we can do to achieve it. Imagining helps us in many ways. I always think or imagine before I do something big. I always imagine before making a choice or decision because I do not know how it will turn out. Sometimes some people think its funny and laughs that imagination cant come true but I do believe that no matter how hard is to accomplish my success, I will always try. My parents always tells me to imagine what I truly want to be when I grow, which is amazing. I think many parents are strict and tells their children to stop imagining things and always study, which I believe education is very important but telling someone to stop imagining is not quite right, Once I read in a article where it said that imagining thing is a natural habit and you will imagine things unless you have disability or blindness. Once I also read a article that says that according to physcology imagining things is important for our brain . We imagine things everyday. When we are imagining things or just thinking, it helps to improve our brain. Scientist always has a prediction or imagines before doing an experience because they dont know what is going to happen. That helps them to be prepared so that if something happens their going to be ready for it. Albert Einstein had a an amazing knowledge also he believed that imagination is important, which made him be a successful person. There are so many celebrities, who wrote a quote about how imagining helped them achieve their goal. For example Taylor swift always imagined that shes going to be a singer when she was young and now she is a singer. Sometimes people can use imagination in a bad way like imagining to rob a bank but its not good, but they need to think deeply how it can affect them. If you also dont use your knowledge cant succeed because you have to use imagination and knowledge to succeed, you have to use both.

Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Therefore some students still wouldnt commit to a career. Although some say, It is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Actually, It is a good idea for students to commit to career at a young age. But some people think, It is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. A reason they have for that is that, The students that dont commit to a career early wont have to start paying bills. But I persnally Think It is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Because, If students commit to a career at a young age they will learn to be independent then students that dont start a career at a young age. This is what people said about not commiting to a career at a young age. Therefore, What i think is the oppsite of what they think.

But, Another reson why people think it is not a good idea for students not to start a career at a young age is, Because the students will start paying less attention in school and in class. This is why i think students should start a career at a young age. What some other people said about, it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. Is because students would be tired in school. Students would be stressing over school and work at the same time. But, What some other people said about, It is a good idea for students to commit to career at a young age. Students would have money of there own to buy the stuff they need.

The issue is discovering your passion or career earlier can help you to discover and prepare for you goals in the future early. I agree it is a good idea for student to commit their career because know or understand what you want to do in the first place can help you to discover what and what you good at or bad at and what you need to pay more atention on like for example you wanted to become an engineer you need to pay more atention on maths and science and now all your focus will be on that. FIRSTLY Know and understand what you want to be in life can bring you much more closer to your goal like understanding the question is part of the answer so understanding or discover your career can be a helpful thing towards your future for example: I want to be a teacher but i didnot know that i cant speak a good english and i dont now how to explain so that my student can understand me but i never knew about this until now and it too late for me to go back and discover a new career because am half away to graduate from high school. SECONDLY You cant do what they like but you can do what you like your passion cant be stop even by yourself not talking about other your love and determination can make you do it but that will only happen if you discover your career early and prepare for it for example: My passion for become an auto engineering increase every single day i just cant wait to be one because since when i was in middle school have discover my career my dream and i know i have passion for it have prepared and determine myself for it THIRDLY After high school it will be too late for you to think about your career and what you want to become in future and beside in high school they prepare you and guide you towards your specific career and you not yet discover your career it will be a tough one for you out there example you dont like anything or you dont know what to do after high school and graduate without knowing what you gonna do out there your life will be at risk it just like you in a sea with a speed boat but you dont know how to ride it with a opportunity but you dont know how to used it My Conclusion is know what you want to do because life is about time and when you discover your career earlier you will have more time to prepare and determine yourself if you really ready for it before is too late your career should discover earlier it can be helpful for student in future.

If it wasnt for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldnt be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptops , computers , gaming systems and their smart tvs. Now with this new technology the school systems have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes. Some would say that online classes would not benefit students id say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefits way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free shed finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when shed finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together. The people that say that online classes arent beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes wont have to worry about those issuses. Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention. Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free. Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students 8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house. In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples ive given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank.

And rely on your self not anybody. And reasons why every individual should to make their own decision is to achieve their goals in life.

706,2270,FAAFFC983E47,"The majority of the students take about four years to graduate and go to the college, but also there are students who decide to finish the high school in tree years or as soon as possible. The question is, why are they trying to finish the high school earlier that the other ones?. A few people decide to finish the high school because they have other kind of goals to accomplish like travel or enlist to the Army etc. In some situations this people arent able to take electives courses like, Graphic Design, Culinary arts, Earth space, Mathematics, Health AP or Driving class. Whatever of this ones or others ones they cant enjoy them. In other situations this students take nigh school or summers school or both. In my personal opinion take nigh school is really tired because when you leave the school yo have about one hour to get ready and go to the other school to take your course. In other way, there are students who do not have support by their parents to finish the high school, and that is why they decide to finish early to have more time and find a job to support themselves. Even if they have a half time job, is not enough. Enlist to the Army is a good idea for some people especially for high school students, they have a conversation with their parents to have the aprovation to do three years in the high school and get a career into the Army. Some guys also want to finish early because they want to go to the college in other country or because they want to travel and have a extravagant life, this are the most common situations of why students decide to graduate during three years, but is better that dropped the school in the last year if they have the normal school ( four years). I think that this programs that the district offer is good for those who have the potential to do it and finish the high school as soon as possible, and they need to know the probability to do not have or be able to have elective courses or Generic_School. I know about some guy who decided to take this program offered by the schools districts. He told me that is hard because while he was in the school he also studied for the exams of nigh school and he had courses really bored and after that, he took summers school all of this on his freshman year, I think that the only need to be constant interest and keep a good grade to success. In my opinion take the traditional four year is better because you can enjoy of many things like the clubs in the school, community service or even participate in a sport team in the school like soccer, football, tennis or basketball. this things is what make a school awesome. in the traditional four year, you can pick electives courses that you really like it and do not make you bored. Also in the traditional four year you can talk to you consular to have Generic_School. But when you take the tree years you can not enjoy about you favorite things. Take the tree year since my point of view is bad but could be great for other ones who has different things to accomplish, I dont have rush to finish early, and that is why I think about the tree years and the traditional schedule for the four years.

An afterschool homework club would be nice to have because they get better grades, they could study more, and they could understand the subject better First of all, they get better grades by helping each other on their homework and they can socialize to know more people, make new friends. Plus they can make up stuff they havent done at all and have a zero in their grade. It also benefits in all ways, you could get straight As by just taking 1-3 hours extra hours of your day and putting the work into it. If you dont work at all you could consider trying harder to pass the class. Next, they could study more. Studying more could be a benefit because better test grades, better quiz grades, etc. Also they could get ahead on their classes by doing extra homework and normal work. If you never study you could start by considering to join this club. It could be loads of fun if you make it fun. Therefore, they could understand the subject better by getting someone to help them. Doing loads of extra work to get your grade up and understand it better. They could help each other out and could achieve their goal of getting to understand the difficult subject. Finally, those are the reasons why the idea would be a benefits for everyone. It could help everyone out in every way.

Its hard to make the online or video to offer the distance. Because when the students are in online or when they try to make video they are not going to take care them self. For example: I remember when I was six grade my friend PROPER_NAME was making online video. We went to classes from home to know how far it is. On that time she just focus on her video she wasnt focus on her way. After that, she try to cross the way but she still making video. She didnt saw the car she try to cross the road. So,she got some accident because of the video and she just focusing what she is doing. The most important way is to offer the distance classes from home is using map. Its easy to know how far or how close it is. Other ways, the students have to take care there self when they are in the way because there is a lot of car. Additional, there are not going to take care them self when they are making online or video. They just focus what there are doing. For example: when I was tine grade I remember my friend PROPER_NAME she was eleven grade. She try to offer the distance for her friend by making video. When She was school from home. Then, she started showing the way. On that time, she wasnt take care her self because she was focusing the video. Next, she try to cross the way by raining. She didnt pay attention the way and she got car accident. On that time she passed away she died. I agree some students think they would benefits from being able to attend classes from home. But most of them are not going to take care them self because there are not focusing the way. They just focusing what there are doing or they just focusing online or video. Additional, using map is butter than making online or video. Other ways its hard to make online or video for offer the distance. Most students are not going to focus when there are making that.

710,2274,98D8FF9E3C56,"The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. Thats why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. This plan has two positions,some people agree, but others dont think its a good idea. Is it a good idea? It is. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early if the students want because they can save time, they can have new experiences, new challenges which help for their life in the future, they still can take elective courses also have vacations latter after college or work if they want. Lets start with the first reason now. Do you agree that the time is limit? The time is the only thing you cant move back. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. These programs will help many students save time. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. They choose have more time after success instead of have time when they havent had anything. The next reason will be the reason help students the most. Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more. The last reason refers to elective courses. Many students like these courses, but some students dont. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they dont like or do not helpful for their career. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. They can choose also consider what is they need. Moreover, this plan dont require you skip these elective courses, you just may not be able to take these, so if you want to take courses, you can plan for this. It depends on your choice. On the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. But if you think that it means you dont confide your ability also dont try for your future. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. You can choose your way, success will come soon or later depends on you. Conclusion, we should support some schools offer these programs that allow high school students to graduate early if they can. Our life will change if we change, our success will come if we try, and it will happen early if we have a plan. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. However, it will be fair if students can choose take or not these programs. ",9,7,8,7,6,7,2027,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
711,2275,9735E542665C,"Imagine having less day of school, students would be happy and could make their education simple. Some films have alredy adopted a four day work week, but they will work ten hours a day. Should school do the same thing by extending the school day and have four days of school? I believe that extending the school day and having four day of school could affect students by; getting them tired and they coud no longer in school. To begin with, it has been said that students are tired in school because they have seven hours of school everyday . Imagine giving them nine hours of school, they could get tired quick and have stress. To illustrate, a student woke up at 6:30am to prepare to go to school, he will start the school at 8:00am and he will be finish at 5:00pm. After school the student will got home tired, he will jus eat dinner and go sleep. As you can see, students could not have time to play and do their homework. If school extend the school day, students could be just tired all the time. in conclusion, students are not slaves, they need time to play and do their homework. In addition, extending the school day for students and have four days of school for them, this could make them not going to school. Another example, imagine a high school student have to finish school at 5:00pm knowing kids nowadays they dont like school that much. This could be an obstacle for this high school student and he will decided to not going to school anymore because he will feel a long day of school. As you can see, students could be absent in school if they extend the school day, and this could be a big probem for the community and for the country. Yet some people argue that extending the school day and having four day of school, could make the students more intelligent. It is tue that giving extended time to students and give them only four days of school, could make them smarter. But they will not longer like school because they will feel tired and they will not going to school anymore. And this could be a huge problem for students and schools In conclusion, schools should not allow to have four days of school and extending two hours more because this could affect students by; getting them tired and they could not longer in school. Lets make students feel comfortable in school, but not make them feel slaves. Students needs time with friends and family.

I think students should wait until there last year or second to last year of high school, to think about getting a career. Students in high school should focus more on school rather than a career. But they can think about what they wanna do after high school. Do you think by the time students enter high school, They are expected to identify a career? I think that students who are about to enter high school. Should focus on school and than getting out of high school. High school is not a joke it matters. You have to pass your classes in order to go to the next grade. If you fail some classes you repeat those classes again the next year or have to go to summer school. You dont wanna go to summer school. I wouldnt wanna have to go to summer school just because I didnt pass the first time. When kids enter high school, should they think about a career? I think they should take electives that relate to a career. like fun electives they can take during the school year. I think that high school is getting us prepared for the real world kinda. Because once we leave high school we are on our own. Noone is gonna help you besides your family and friends. Thats why I suggest getting a job so you can take care of yourself.

Of Course high school has drama but we have to deal with and its not that hard. I think kids could brain storm about getting a career at a young age. High school isnt easy we all have our problems we have to deal with. But high school is temporary just like pain is temporary when your dealing with depression. High school in general sucks sometimes because of the drama and high school girls. The teachers arent like middle school and elementary school teachers.

Their first ever job was something that they probably had never done before, this makes it so that they had to learn and adapt to something they were unfamiliar with. Hiring these people, people who had little to no experience to what they are now are the one who went on in life by learning and adapting. Hiring new people can also benefit employers in a positive way, by having someone with no experience can help grow that person professionally. Also finding someone with a lot of knowledge at something may be difficult for they all have jobs that require experience. This in the end can make it hard for employers to find someone just right for the position they need Hiring someone who doesnt have experience in the job position you are looking for can be a good thing, first, it can help the employee discover skills for themselves and outside of the job, second, it can or will make the employee much better and more reliable for the position. New employees need a mentor or someone who can show them the correct ways to do the job and who ever the mentor is, it can help them grow their leadership skills dramatically. Having skill diversity among the group can also be very beneficial it can result in the new employees finding new ways to manage things on the job and may even find ways to replace the old rules for better ones. Some people are fast learners so he/she will adapt to the new work environment very easily. Building up experience is a key part in life and and some point there will be a time to get a job and seeing that everyone has started from the bottom, and hiring someone new can really benefit the company and the employer Do i think that employers should hire someone that doesnt have any experience at something; yes, once hiring he/she the employee will do whatever it takes to keep that job and find new ways to grow while on the job. it is also a good way to expand company diversity and skills. In the end, anyone who is looking for a job should be given an opportunity to learn and acquire skills to become better and stronger experience wise. Employers should mostly take notice on how ready and determined he/she is for the job rather than hoe much experience they have. At some point even the employer was given a chance so whoever the person may be should also be given a chance at this opportunity.

715,2279,CD5F70E5C1D7,"To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites. Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends. but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones thats going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing. And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.",6,7,7,7,7,6,2812,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
716,2280,7FF6972B86C2,"Everyone chooses their own character no matter if you are small or big. A persons character is based on their personality. Its easy for people to choose a character for themselves either a good or a bad character. Having a good character shows that you are a good person, but if you decide to have a bad character people no longer will trust you and you will be worthless to others, so this is why we choose our own character. We choose our own character because our character is based on how we interact with other people. Some people dont have a good character and thats why people neither wants to trust them or talk to them. Even in the movie no one likes the the bad character because they are mean, bad, and no good to others but to harm them and put them in danger. A coworker of mine was very rude to customers. He was always mad therefor no other employees wanted to talk to him. One day a customer complained to the manager about how he was being rude to her, so the manager decided to fire him from his job. We choose our character based on how we dress. people can present themselves as neat person by the way how they dress in public or anywhere else. If a person has a job interview and he wants to look good then he has to wear a dress that fits his character and makes him that he wants the job. A few years ago my uncle was invited to a wedding party but he wasnt sure what to wear, however some some of his friend told him to wear something casual but that didnt fit his character because he was a boss of a company, therefor many of his coworker would see him there so he decided to wear a suit because it was best for his character. We choose our own character by the way how we talk to other people. For example if my brother speaks to others in a good manner people will always respect him. Being nice and respecting others will represent a good character of you. It is very easy for someone to change their character, whatever you choose to be that will be your character. Having a good character is very important in our everyday life, furthermore having a good personality will also effect a persons character so in order to have a better character you need to have a good personality. Some people say that we cant choose our character because its beyond our control, however choosing your character is not hard you just need to have a good personality and have to be nice to others. Most people that we dont know how to choose our character traits, therefor choosing a good character do not need any special skills. All a person has to do to have a nice character they have to dress properly they need to have good manners and dont be rude to others and this is all it takes to have a good character. Other people may say its hard for us to choose our character traits because we are not able to, however for some people its hard but the things that a person does in their everyday life those things chooses their character it determines if they have a good character or not.

Making your own decisions in life is a being thing in life it shows how responsible and independent you are. Some people choose to make goo decisions some choose to make bad ones. The bad decisions can cause a lot of damage to others in different ways. Some examples of bad decisions are drugs, drunk driving, and joining gangs. these decisions can cause a lot of pain towards the people around you, joining gangs is a high risk of getting yourself killed and for no reason. once you get your self killed you did nothing but make everyone that love you cry. Then theres drunk driving you put yourself at risk as well as others that have a family waiting for them to come home to them. While you made the decision to drive after you drank alcohol you have to deal that to put others in the hospital because of the decision you made. Then you got drugs that is never good for you. The only way to stop doing them is to never start them. Your family wont be happy with you nether the people you love, but other than those there are some good decisions people make. Decisions helps you figure out what you want to do after high school. Maybe Like what job you want to per sew or what you want to study in college or maybe if you want to start a family. All of these are good examples for making good decisions to make in the future. Jobs are really hard to find and get if you dont have experience. They are always looking for people who are ready and happy to be working in there store. But if your go to college first and youve figured out what job you want you now what you have to study to get that job. That helps you in many ways and with that you can make a family and not worry about haveing the money to support that family. While people are trying to figure all that out we have kids that like to start trying to be independent and make their own decisions. while these kids are trying to do all that they have there family members thinking that my kid can do that on his own if you know what I mean by that basically what Im trying to get to is that there mom and dad believe that there kid dosent need help with one thing. It shows them that there there turning in to a man or woman. there parents know that letting them make their own decisions help them think for them self and grow as a person.

When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What Im trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful. One reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you dont have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice. Second reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better. My third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself ""you got this"" or ""you are going to do good on this test"". I say that asking multiple people for advice is important. Its important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day.

725,2289,A35B4B7CBD24,"There are some of the school districts offer programs that allow high schools students to graduate in three years. There are also some good students who always have good grades in all the classes. To graduate one year earlier, students must take extra online classes or elective courses. Otherwise, they will not get enough credit to graduate in three years instead doing it in traditional four years. It is a good idea to graduate one year earlier and enter college or the work force one year earlier because if students finish high school one year earlier, they can admit into a good colleges and fixed their career little faster for lifetime, they can help their family with economic problems, they can also make their own purchases. Initially, this idea to finish high school one year earlier is the best idea for them who want to fixed their lifetime career earlier. Some of the student who come from the other countries just by themselves also graduate in three years, may be because their entire family lives in back home. Suppose, they do not live good life in their back home. Thats when students want to give them a better life by bringing them here. To bring them here, the students have to be able to have enough money and to feed them enough after bringing. And students can do all these works earlier if they finish high school in three years instead being in a high school for traditional four years. Secondly, this idea is good for the students whos entire family already lives here, and there are some economic problem in the family. Student have permission to graduate high school earlier and enter work force earlier to help their family with economic problems. They graduate in three years and get a better full time job and help their family with economic problems. So, that way their family will not get stuck anywhere for the economic problems. Finally, this idea to graduate one year earlier is good for them who want to finish high school earlier, to go to college and also to have a part time job on the other hand. So, they can make their own purchases, like phone, paying phone bill, going out to eat with friends, going on a trip with friends, etc. Students can also have a full time job who do not want to go to college. There is nothing wrong with graduating from high school in three years by working hard. Some students do it to make their dream become true faster, some students do it for their family problems, some students do it for their own problems. However or whenever students graduate but parents want them all to graduate and make their future bright. After all, graduating from school is most important thing in every students life.

One of the reasons are that I think this can be a more easy way for students to learn is because they cannot be distract to anothers students, so they can work with tranquility. Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they dont need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school. For example, if you work at home, you dont need permission to use the bathroom, because youre at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online. Another example about why I think that working online is more benefit for students, is because they can have all the recourses, and tools necessary to work, also you cannot be feel bad about if you dont finish a test ,or a quiz at time in school, working online you ge all the necessary time to complete a test ,or a quiz, you can more time to do your homework, also you can eat everything that you want working online, in the school you cannot eat on classes time. In conclution, working online is a more easy way for students to learn than working at the school, because had a good help and a lot of good reasons, and also a lot of good benefits.

For example, if Generic_Name achieves shooting five times at the three point line and makes all of them; he will feel good about himself. His self-esteem is feeling good so he may try to do more next time at the three point line. But feeling good about yourself is not the only thing that will help with your self-esteem. Another is it will make you feel that you could do anything. For example, if Generic_Name wins the art fair only in her class, but the school is having an art fair for the whole sophomore class. Her self-esteem will kick in and she may sign up Also you can learn how to not give up for example if Generic_Name lose the class discussion but the class is going to have another one the next day she is going to try her hardest to win the next class discussion.

It is not that easy as it sounds because they need to prepared themselves and notify that it will be difficult to reach their goals. However at the end they will see that was for a good and valuable things for their lives. They might will need to work hard and feel like to exceed themselves. It is good idea to graduate earlier because students will have the opportunity to find a job after they graduate and earn money then later they can start going college, they will be more productive in society, and they will develop their skills and knowledge. Students that graduate earlier need to have enthusiasm and know that they will have a more difficult life and realize that they will have more responsibilities and duties in society, when they are out of school they should take that as an advantage to use their time wisely and help themselves by trying to find a job and earn some money; if they are taking the decision to go to college in few years. It is hard to find a job when the time pass and they did not practice all the things that they learn in the past and then realize that they should do sometime productive same as when they were in high school before they graduate. In addition they will be helping their parents same as they did it when they were in school, by supporting and care about of them, they will be contributing in home and society. Also, they will have others accomplishments that they might want to reach it and celebrate with their families and make them feel proud and happy of their goals. Understanding that all the things that they did are for have good benefits and others people will used as good thing to defend or help themselves. Finally, all students have the same capacity to show up and do the right things, after they graduate they have the opportunity to find a job and demonstrate how the develop their skills and knowledge. Staying positive and knowing that they can do great and specials things will make them feel proud of their works and then they will prove that they can do amazing things like everybody does. Providing high qualities of themselves in a workplace can help them to know and find new information about what things are happening in the world that round them.

Some people try to accomplish themselves to demonstrate that they not need someone else to be successful. Some people believe that believe in themselves is more accomplishment than believe in another people. Those people who believe in individuality became more independent. In addition for some people to be themselves is the most greatest accomplish because people learn how they can value for themselves and demonstrate that they can be something else without help of someone. Some people rather be individuality because they didnt like the opinion of others. To begin with, People learn how they can be value for themselves. For example, ""those people who decide to marry and separate from their actual family, during time they become learning to how survive with out help of their family and they willing that they can value for themselves."" Some people demonstrate that they are independents for their actions. To be ourselves teach as how confront our mistakes and how to process them. secondly, Be individual make people more believable in themselves. For instance, ""When people make thing for themselves they believe in them and being positively."" Some people believe that is more better be individuality because they believe in what they do that what the others do. Some people be individuality because they are more believable for themselves. Those people who are believable in themselves are people who truly want to be successful in their life because when people are individuality they do things for their own and they realize that they are not depending for someone. In the other hand, some people argue that is not good idea to be individual. Those people believe that be individual is a bad idea because they say that two person have more ideas than one. However, that is not true because be individual makes people to believe in themselves and also is the greatest accomplish to keep believing than what others believe for us. Be individuality make people more believable in their selves and be positive in their own decisions.

732,2296,5384378F1AC2,"The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I dont have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got Fs for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process. Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the strangers voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential. In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.",8,8,8,8,8,7,1093,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
733,2297,E969EF7D2D8A,"Given students a long summer opportunities would give them the chance to take a restful break from all the ethic school year they have being having. Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . Though others are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. I think it not a great idea because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves. Most students should get a long summer break because they have to take their time and review their work and go to summer school for a make up class that would help them to get credits back or graduates the coming years. Imagine have in a break during the summer, would any students have the chances of making up class work during the winter? or would they even think about the ideas of doing a class makeup?. I think no because they would be giving an excuse about the snowy weather and the real cold weather and schools would be canceling which would affects the process of curriculum on what the class are learning. for example during the winter when we sometimes gets a snowy weather we cancel schools and that one day that school get cancel it affects most teachers planing on what they should do for that day. For instance the school would have to take a week off of that summer break so that the teacher would have time to complete what he or she has to teach the students. Therefor students needs a longer summer break to succeed on their goal. Meanwhile other students need a long summer breaks to spend a long time with their families because they has already spend a long school learn especially the once that had honors class also the students who are in college. Most students who spends some quality time with their family might have a better chance of setting up a goal for the next school year by all means because they are getting a better advice from their family, for example I had a understanding that students who spent the most time with their family discussing their school year would get motivated and has a goal for themselves before the new school year, meanwhile in the winter break, you wont have that much time to spend with your family, because most of your family who live far across would most likely not want to come visit because of the winter. For example when during the winter most of my family who lives abroad or out of states would never come to visit us during the winter break because they said it winter and it really cold, while in the summer each and everyone of our family would come to visit because we spend some quality time together and they always give me some good advice on how to be successful on my education and what goal I should set to gain my success. Finally though other are thinking that students should have a year round school where there would be a three to four weeks in the summer and a longer winter break but meanwhile a week off in spring and fall break because during snow days the students would have no school and they would get to go to school while it really cold outside. With this opinion, I think am little bit agree because during the winter the snowy weather kind of disrupt everything or activities that was supposed to happened during the school year. Meanwhile another hands the students does not have to missed a week or weeks to school but a day or two. Therefor they should get a long summer break even tho they would gets a week or two off, for instance I believe if they get a a day or two there would be no chances for them to forgets everything they learned during the time school opens to the beginning of winter. for example if they miss one or two days they would have a day to revised their notes and maybe be prepare for a coming test or quiz in the future, never the ;less they wont have to study for too long for a test or quizzes again. In conclusion Most students enjoy summer break vacation. but some educators feel that the summer is too long because students has a long summer vacation would take the time to review their school year and go to summer school for makeup class while others are planing to spend time with their families . because Most students thinks the long summer is a great opportunity for them to participate in some various positive activities and for them to sets a standard goal for themselves.

735,2299,FA55AEEF8F9C,"Alot of people use cell phones In classrooms which I think Its a good Idea. Cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. In my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find Information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about 10 to 15 minutes. Another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. They wont have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers. Now lets talk about having a cell phone In classrooms In case of an emergnecy. One reason I believed they should allowed cellphones In classrooms because In case of a lockdown. If a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call 911 and give details of the suspect. In addition to my other reason, Students should be allowed to have their cellphone In case of an emergency call. what If something happens at home. For example, A students sibbling gets sick and doesnt stop crying until he sees one of his family. So the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents cant do anything because they cant leave work or theyll get fired. The parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling. In conclusion, I see no reason why students shouldnt be allowed to use cellphones In classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. It can save someones life. so I think students should be allowed to have cellphones In classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.

736,2300,1DDC2D1DB4EE,"Dear principal, Im writting this letter to let you know my opinion on the idea of change the school lunch menu into a new healthier menu. I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier. Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily. By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that theyre had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they dont like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy. Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food. In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better.

Also it will help them get battle in school. They can learn to work with the younger kids. Therefor it will help teachers to be able to get there work done at that time.

Reason i think it should is beacuse we can have a 3 day weekend, spend more time with family, get enough sleep,if studnts have after school jobs they can have good hours. Like for example If my school have adopted a four day school week with each day two hours. It would help alot because i can go school do my two hours on Monday,Tuesday,Wedesnday, and Thursday and i feel like we could help out teachers alot not only studnets could help out staffs teachers and studnets . Have Friday Saturday Sunday off go work on my 3 day weekend get sleep spend time with my family get my sleep and naps. It would help alot and be more easier for others and myself. So yes i feel like our school should follow up with for day school week extending the school day two hours others students would not like it that way but teachers and studnets to but from my opinon yes i think our school should follow up with that .",5,5,5,4,4,5,1957,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

In my personal life, I used to assist to a barbering career, I learn the basics. This had help me to cut some people hair by this I earn some extra money while I am In High School. Any career is hard but is vital in life. I believe that it is a good idea for students to join a career in a young age because they gain more experience, students can work in a young age. These are two major things why they should participate, sooner Ill explain it. Students could gain more experience in a particular career. This is because the brain still fresh and is perfect to learn new things. Teenagers would be able to learn new things everyday. They can learn how to solve a simple thing, for example at home with electrical or mechanical issue. Furthermore, students could be able to be masters in the future of any career. They could be experts because they will have a longer period of time to practice and keep finding stuff to learn. If a person have experience they can even become managers. A career would help to find better jobs. sometimes people see careers as a waste of time but, if a person go to a job with a career taking;that person is able to earn money. If a person have experience they can even become managers. Besides, students are able to work in a young age. They could work in summer break. I believe that this can help them to save money to go to college. Furthermore, teenagers are capable to practice their skills. In conclusion, any career can be useful to succeed in life. Teenagers are able to choice their future. They could master the career to perfection. Students, because they are young they have time to learn a lot. They should decide to join one before is too late. This can help them to have a better future.",7,6,6,7,7,7,1160,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
740,2304,E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently. To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too. Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things. In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time.",8,7,6,6,6,6,3217,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
741,2305,D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break. Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others. Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyones high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year. Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time. Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress.

744,2308,6FDAD6124B9E,"Ever since you were little, have you ever noticed that your really good at something as you grew over time? Everyone has a talent or a skill that are common or very unique. I have gained a talent over years and I just realized not to long ago. My number one talent I have it dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired by the artist I mostly love. My number one talent is hip-hop. Hip-hops really been a big part of my dancing life over years. I took classes at a place and just remembered having so much fun and learning new dance moves. Since I started taking classes of hip-hop and learning new things, I thought that this might be the number one thing I might actually be good at. I have once broken my ankle by learning a new dance move. The bone was out of place and the bone was a bit cracked. At that moment I was just thinking about the pain but once I got home and was able to rest, I just had the fear of not being able to dance and it made my heart shatter into 7. After a 8 or 9 weeks I felt better and was able to dance again. I had to be careful and not hurt myself again. when I first got there I was not a good dancer like most of them. Once I was there for almost a year I learned a lot because they would tell me little secrets of theirs. I got better ever since and now I teach my closest friend how to dance. I took dance class for 9 years and it helped me a lot with my dancing skills. I got inspired by the artist I love the most. Ever since 2012 December 22 I found a group of boys that were new. I watched their videos and I was in love with them. They debuted in 2013 June 13 with their first song called ""No More Dream"". They were called BTS. There are a seven member group, there stage names are RM, Jin, Suga, J-hope, Jimin, V, and Jungkook. They are a band from South Korea. Their fans are called ARMY. As years passed by and they became the biggest boy band in the whole universe and galaxy! I was inspired by their music but also their dancing, which got me more into dancing. I learned all their dance moves from their music videos to their stage performances. They also inspired me to dance more because ever since I was little I liked dancing and over the years I got better, they kept telling me to keep going which I did and thats when I made up my mind. I was now planning to become a back up dancer for them when they went on tour. I was planning to already become a dancer so I practiced more. When I became 13 I was able to dance and more like some one was controlling me with strings, like I was a puppet. Now that I am 14 I decided to teach others who wanted to learn how to dance. Its been 9 years of dancing so why not. After learning to dance hip-hop I felt like an animal thats been let back in the wild. Dancing is a big part of life if you love it and enjoy it. BTS has taught people many things but the one line they said about dancing is ""There are 2 deaths in life. The first one is when you lose the passion of music and dance and the second one is death. The first death though is more painful."" Those are not the exact but very close to the meaning. My number one talent is dancing hip-hop because I took classes for 9 years and I got inspired but the artiest I love the most.

745,2309,CEF302996231,"Dear Dr. Generic_Name, Thank you for taking time out of your day to read my letter, hope you and your staff are doing well. My name is Generic_Name and Im currently a Junior at Generic_School. I believe that some students should benefit from taking online classes because we wont have to worry about turning in papers late, or having to hearing teachers to put our phones and headphones away, and also I wont worry about owing school lunch money. Online classes is a should and it can also be a shouldnt, and i will explain why its a should. In school we all panic when we hear a due date, especially when its up close. Students work better at their pace than rather to wait on the teacher, teachers go slow just for the other students get to know whats going on. When taking tests, or quizzes, we seemed to get rush because we only have that class for and hour and some change. In some cases if we dont finish on time they, will ask us to stay after school. Some of our parents work late nights and wont be able to get a ride back home. Also in school we all get distracted so easily, like from fights that happen in school, drama, and class clowns that are not really doing their work. And kids need to concentrate in their work instead of lacking off. At Generic_School, phones and headphones are a huge problem. Some of us like to listen to music and work better with it, but however, some teachers dont always allow it in the classroom. Classes at home can be such a big change in a good way, we wont get in trouble if we get found using our phones or even listening to music. A lot of teachers find this disturbing and run to writing us up, but they wont understand how much faster your brain functions when listening to music, it gets you more concentrated into your own work. Our parents work and the school thinks that they make lots of money, due to that cause the school charges us for the food we eat. In some cases we get milk thats been expired, and they dont even notice it. Classes that we can take at home could benefit us here, we have better food at home and wont worry about if the food that we get at school is expired or not. Online classes can be much cheaper than to actually go to school. At home, we can eat breakfast and lunch and not think about that eating breakfast or too early or if eating lunch is too late. Thank you once again for reading my thoughts, I strongly agree that our students should benefit from taking online classes while being at home.

But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals. The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant. Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping.

It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society. Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it.

How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals. In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age. In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.",6,6,7,6,7,8,2191,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
751,2315,D1B607165DAB,"In the past, I was scared to go beyond at what I was good at which was soccer. I agree with what the quote which said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" because if you stay at the limits that you were already at before youll never know what other things you can accomplish and we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself "" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that your not improving your life. I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you stay at the limits that you were already at before youll never know what other things you can accomplish. To begin with, you want to to go beyond standards because maybe youll learn something new ,or you will encounter an ability that you probably thought you didnt have. For example, when I was in freshmen in high school I decided to start playing and training for soccer and I tried out for the junior varsity soccer team I told myself I am gong to play at my standards, so the coach saw me playing nervous and he asked me "" why are you playing nervous"" I said, "" I am trying to play at my standards"" the coach said, ""Just relax."" after that I found out I had so many abilities to become a great soccer player. In addition, its not bad at all trying to go beyond your limits because the more you go beyond your limits the more youll want to keep doing it. Also, theres that one saying "" Go Big Or Go Home"" one of the sayings I live up to. Finally, you always want to think big for the most part of your life. Also you always want to try new things in life thats the only way youll grow in life. I agree with what the quote said, ""Unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" we as people have to acknowledge the fact that in one point in life you probably said to yourself "" I am going to maintain this life."" by saying that, your not improving your life. To begin with, life is short to be honest you and I am still trying to do things to improve my life. For example, I am 17 year old in highschool, I listen to with one song called ""the nights"" by Avici. He talks about his dad telling him you always want to experience new things and try to live life to the fullest, so right there I am just saying to myself dont maintain the same life, try to experience new things in life period. In addition, dont have a simple life try to be creative in this life. Also, you might not be ready to go beyond your limits, but just know that one day you might be willing to give it a try. Finally, there was one time I was scared to go on big roller coasters. I could only go on medium roller coaster because they didnt look scary at all, but there was moment on the day I told myself I getting a big roller coaster so I did and it made feel good about myself because I tried something new. Also some people may say that, you will grow even though you dont try anything new in your life. In addition, some people probably dont even care about life. Finally, others might have their own opinions about this topic. Also some wouldnt really care about. In conclusion, in the future I will try to improve my limits and think big.

Because, Great Britain has,the most interesting and mysterious places to visit, the culture differences, and why is visiting Great Britain is great motivation to start learn English. Firstly, Great Britain has a lot of tourist places to visit for example, Big Ben. Big Ben is the one of the main historical places that tourist should visit first. Also, Great Britain built a lot of castles between 15th and 17th century. This castles were serving to, protect rich people or royal families from attacks, and to keep them warm. But right now most of this castles are not used to live inside because people left hem alone and nobody could keep them clean and safe. Its great place to visit to feel how people lived differently than us right now. Secondly, Great Britain believes in very interesting type culture in the world. People are living their life with optimistic view even if they have not the best time in their life. Actually, people who lives their whole life in Great Britain has beautiful accent that helps them to make a lot of dramatic operas. All of the Great Britain history, people believed in Christianity and promoted to other people, it cause that all of their old colonies are believing in Christianity.

759,2323,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone. To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the stores stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals. Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future. As can be seen, it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine.

762,2326,3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home. Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up. Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate. The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer. Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home. ",9,8,8,8,8,8,789,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
763,2327,C3F3118898B5,"My sister decided to be a doctor at a young age and started to focus on that path. Now, she is a doctor. Choosing which path should be taken in an early age and preparing for it beforehand, will help a lot for the future. Although some people might argue students should commit to a career later in their life, students should commit to a career at a young age because it helps them to decide for their future early, it makes them focus on a specific goal, and they wont feel more pressured to choose a career later in their life. To begin critics say that choosing their occupation later in their life is more beneficial because they will be open to more new options later than in a young age. To support this idea, a child decided to be an engineer when s/he was young, but suddenly s/he changed his mind and decided to be a surgeon. Should s/he choose what s/he wants to be now or should s/he choose what s/he wanted to be when s/he was young? However, it is obvious that choosing a career later in their life will only make them feel burdensome and their life will only be more intricating. A more valid argument is that choosing a path to be taken at a young age will let you have a better life in the future. For example, a girl started to prepare for the career she had chosen when she was young and started to work hard for that. Finally, her hard work paid off and acheived what she wanted to be. This evidence is valid because preparing for the career in a young will let your life go smoothly, will give more free time in the future, and wont feel pressurized. Although people might say that students committing towards your career and choosing it at a young age will lead you to a better life because it makes them to focus on a certain goal of their life, will make them decide what they want for the future, and wont feel pressurized to choose their career.

Sometimes work alone can be a good choice, because is youre wrong, you cant blame to nobody. In conclusion, I believe that groups are more helpful for students, because they learn to take other decision and compare. About work alone, Im not agree, because you try to do something, maybe thats good, but youre not count with other ideas, expressions, or declaration of other thought. In my opinion is more beneficial working in groups that show us compare, analyze, and be friendly with others.",5,4,6,5,5,7,2933,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

First i think is a good thinking because during High School you can find a class that can be related about the job the you want or the person you want to be. My second Though is that it will help you and you will learn more about the job and have more experience that way wen you get the job you will know what is about it and how it works. My third though is that it will make you progress before you get the job you will know what to do. My conclusion is that its good to plan thinks during High School because that way people help you and teach you about the job or the person you want to be it will make you progress.

At this time everybody are forgeting how beutiful is lives with out technology. We can do alot of things with out it. For example: Play outside with friends, go to libraries, and stay outside with natural. Some people say the kids have to have limitation of what they doing on they computer or cells phones. On the other side people say that is good for teenager having not limitation because they can learn more. I think teenager need a limitation of what they doing in the phones. Furthermore parents should cheking what they doing in the internet. However, some people think is good for teenager not having a limitation because they learn more for their future. On the other hand some people say that that tenenager cant complete a taskd with out having contact with other person. I thinbk having a conversition with other is good because you get to know that person and also get stronger the relationship. When you meet a strager in the internet is dangeous, not everyone is a good person. Some parents think that the kids are just playing in the internets but they do not. I think having a conversiation to you or playing games without speaking I think that have a limitation until you know well that person. In addition, sometimes people used to buy alot of things from the internet without knowing that person, that is dangerous. People that are seeling on wedsides that always offer what the really have or maybe they just want the money. If you going to buy anything for the internet just make sure the wedside is safes. Buying staff for the internet is getting wrong because people do not want to go aout and spend time with family. Since wedsides liike Amazon, Ebay, and others came up people atart get all they need from wedside. Bad people are used this on favor to them, they are creating so many fake wedsides to racket people. To continue with, I think a good way to get the kid out the technology is take them to have fun outside like hand out with friends, having friends in a computer like into a videogame or a social media is not healty for the kids. You have to get to know the person before play or talk to them. Sometimes people trick the kids ask them to do bad things. That why technology shoul not be allow for kid at all or if parents decide to give a cells phone or a computer always have to be a limitation.

767,2331,D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"". Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didnt like or didnt want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldnt have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they? Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but wont read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what youre ordering comes with. Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because theyre hurting badly and doctors will say youre perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you dont need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist dont believe in that but most do. So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes dont know what theyre doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",7,7,8,7,6,6,2887,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
768,2332,A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Lets be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody elses ideas In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus mother). To catholic people Jesuss mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lies layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the churchs hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress peoples rights. In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion. I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My arts teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",6,6,6,4,4,4,2155,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

I will try to find ways to helping being kind, nice, social and give new perspective to other people. Being good influence for them is very friendly, is good in all of the reasons. The bad influences are the peolpe who had a to much opportunities and they dont care.

774,2338,924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school dont have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school. First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you cant take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries culture and how did they treat people in their ways. Thats why I think elective classes was important. secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time. In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I dont understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college. Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didnt go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early. Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others.

779,2343,973A3ADFAB72,"My grandmother always says If you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different ways to get in the top of your objective. Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. I am agree with this statement. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people dont trust themself, people dont take second chance, doesnt matter the time. To begin with, most of people do not trust themself. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. You most have to trust in yourself. For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. But one day my grandma talked to him. My grandma told him that he has to try even though things are hard, if he want to accomplish his goals he had to try to make something else to achieve his goals. Secondly, there are people that dont take second chance to get on top of their goals. The 60% of people when they have something done, they dont like the result so they dont want to do it again because they did ones so they dont want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasnt that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong. Hence, it wasnt like that,so what I trying to say is that is essential to try, try, and try, My mom always says dont be scared to do it, the thing that are worth it isnt eassy you have to try and give your best. In addition, many people said you must have to try something else it doesnt matter the time. There are people that doest care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. For example, my best friend Generic_Name always says dont worry about the time you have to get what you want, you have to accomplish the things that you porpuse yourself take the advantage of the time. To sum up, as you can see if you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different things. Just try keep in youjr mind that the ones who work in what they want they to achieve. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but thats not the point. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals. I think people dont believe in themself, dont try twice, and people dont think about the time.",7,6,7,7,5,7,2001,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

They have big stadiums that whole over 100,000 people, they even have some nice features like they have have restruants inside the stadium, one of them has a bedroom inside. Once I would arrive at Spain I would love to try their food because I heard their food was good sou I sesrched it up and the food looks so yummy and tasty. I would also love to ride on a boat and cruise through the city. One of the good things is that its hot most of time over there. Barcelona is a beautiful city in Spain, they speak Catalan. Most of Spanish people would only speak Spanish but with an accent but Barcelona speaks Spanish and Catalan. That would one the languages i would love to learn. Spain has alot of great cities like Generic_City, Generic_City, Generic_City, and a whole bunch more. They each have a stadium. The last place I would love to visit is the capital of Spain which is good. Generic_City is one of the best soccer team in the world.

781,2345,89C7C4115B84,"One place that i really want to go is Generic_City, Italy. i really want to go here mainly because of the stuff i can do their. I really want to see the fancy cars that Italy makes like the Lamborghini or the Ferrari an the Alpha Romero or other car that i normally dont see here were i live. I also want to know more about their culture. i wan to learn their language i want to eat their food i want to know how they live if ts ruff or easy or even both. I really want to eat the real Italian food! i always wanted to see if their would be a difference. One other main reason i want to come is for the tours, i want to get on the cannou then paddle and ride the whole channel. The reason why i really wan to see the fancy cars is because i have a big thing for cars. Ever since i was a little kid my dad will always talk about cars and ill always be with him ill play with toy cars and and when ever i see i nice car i always call it out saying ""thats my mustang gt"" or ""thats my supra"". My cousin always modifies if cars (hes also a car guy) hes another reason why i like cars. He has a Rx-7 every single part is modified he spend more money on his car then he does of him self. When i grow up im going to be a car guy like him. Another reason why i want to go to Italy to see the cars is because were i live you would see a Ferrari like once every 1-2 years and over in Italy seeing a Lamborghini must be like seeing a mustang. so that is why i want to see the luxury cars. I really want to know how their culture is. i want to know how life is over their i want to see if their kind or mean. i want to learn their language so i can talk with them. To me learning their language or understand it will be an easy thing to do. I think it will be easy because Italian and Spanish language is closely the same. I just dont want to be in on part of the country i also want to go to other places because i know that their are different cultures around the country. I mainly want to try the real Italian food i dont want to be eating the American version of Italian food. I want to see if their a difference of the the foods i want to know witch one tastes better or if they taste the same. thats what i want to know about their culture. Another thing that i want to do over their is go in tours. i want to go on tours because when i see on the TV shows, movies, and commercials i always say ""im tryna go their!"". I also want to go to tours over their because i can see the cultures and how places look their. When i go on tour i find out stuff that i didnt know about and finding about new thing is good for your brain. I also always wanted to go to the cannel waters and ride. ever since i was a little kid i would see that people would ride on the cannel waters. This is why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. because of all off these fun stuff i can do their. All of these are reasons why i want to go to Generic_City, Italy. I hope one day i can go to Italy and explore their. ",8,7,8,7,8,6,1830,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

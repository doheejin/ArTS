I agree to this statement because when the people have a possitive attitude they can faund a job and to have a positive attitude is very important in life and also to have a god attitude is important in the hausehold. First: I work in a reusturant and I always have a god attitude with the costumers for example, I now a manager how work in the reastaurent she always have a negative attitude, and I think that is not god to have a negative attitude , to have a good attitude help a lot to have a job in my oponion a think that if I have a possitive attitude I can work very well and also a think that possitive attitude that we have is because the parents of as they teach as how we can have positive attitude . second: I have some friends that they are negatives and that is not god we have always to are positives some people think that is god to have a negative attitude and is not real if we are negative we can do thinks bad , my mom always tell me dont be negative that is not good that why Im always positive, my grandma always tell me dont be negative . Third: positive actitude is good to have I think if we are happy we have a possitive attitude all people can have a positive attitude,if people dont have a posittive attitude they cant get a job thats why all people can have a possitive attitude is important if we have a positive , in all the works they need that we can have a positive attitude because in my job a girl how wants to work in their but she just went one day when my boss are treaning her she dosent have a possitive attitude thats why a think we have to be positive always. In conlusion if all people wants to have a job they have to learn how to have a possitive attitude if you have negative attitude plis change you attitude the negative attitude is not god in work or in oder things , we need to have positive attitude always , the positive attitude depend and how we traet oder people if you dont want to see oder people sad for you bad attitude be positve, have a positive attitude always .",6,5,5,4,4,4,1553,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

What would you like to accomplish in the future? and why would you like accomplish that? I would like to accomplish to become a billionaire for many reasons. First of all if I would accomplish to become a billionaire, I would buy a house to live in, because Im not gonna stay in my moms house all my life, and I dont think my mom would like that either. I would have a pool in the back of my house. I always wanted a pool so I could swim there and wouldnt have to go all the way to the water park. Or just relax in the pool whenever I have free time. Have parties so my friends and I have fun, and my mom wouldt have to tells us to keep it down. Second I would buy my mom a house, a car and some new clothes. she deserves it for all the hard work shes done. I would sell the house that were living in now. And all the money that I will get for the house, I will give it to my mom. I would take her to see a car that she likes and buy it, because the one that she has is a little old and she is always having trouble with it. I would take her to the Mall to see different stores so she can buy different kinds of clothes that she likes. Then I would buy a hospital. I would not let the hospital charge too much for the patients though, because whenever I go to the hospital they charge to much, and some people dont got a lot of money. I would hire the best people for the job so they can help their patients, some nurses or doctors are not too good at their job. I would let any patient in no matter where theyre from, because some hospitals judged the way people look, their race or the color of their skin. Finally I would help the homeless. Not all the money that I would have would be for me, because some I would give it to the homeless. I would buy them food and clothes, because some homeless people have clothes and some dont, and some are just waiting to be feed. I would buy an entire city block, so I can construct apartments for the homeless. whenever I look out the window, when Im in the car, I see a lot of homeless people siting in the side walk or sleeping on it. They deserve a home! And those are my reason for why I would like to accomplish to become a billionaire.",8,6,6,7,7,7,148,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
2,2383,EE855A723FE0,"First of all Hello, Ms. In my opinion I think that is better to work in group. I have 3 reasons that I would like to share with you my reasons are that everyone would like to share differents ideas, Also working in group we can finish more early, and we can socialized with different people. Now Im going to describe you why I choose this reasons. By sharing ideas I meant that everyone can have the opportunity to think and talk about that that person think. Because we dont have the sames ideas as other people thought. After all people in the group share their ideas we can writte in a piece of paper and see which ones are good and makes any sence, about the topic we are talking and we see which ones we can put on the class work we are going to do. Also about that we can finish more early, we can show it to the teacher on time and she can give as her opinion and ask her for some help about what part she think that we can add more especific words or meanings. Because sometimes we think that we have a good project but sometimes we have to figure out what part we can change and put differents things. And the last but not least that we socialized with others this one is my favorite because in this one I can discribe a little bit of my self when I just came to this country from another I was so shy because no one came to talk to me in my second day of school. In my English class my teacher make a groups and some people start talking with me 2 person from that class help me in my english because it wasnt that good. I was so scare because first everyone was looking to me like I had something in my face and in this country everything is different to my country in this one we need some friends that help us when we need some help in english. Them I introduce my self to everyone and I start making new friends. When we are new we think that no one is going to talk with us because we are from another country. Sometimes they dont talk with us because we dont speak the same lenguage as other. But we have to try our best to be friendly and make that the person doesnt feel shy we would like to that person feel happy in school and in each classes. Thas why I think that is good to be working in group not alone. When we have homework or projects we like to have some help then doing by our self that is more hard, the projects are always so difficult or sometimes you dont understand what the teacher said because we are seatting on the back and some students are talking and we couldt hear anything about what the teacher is talking about. But in a group they are 2 or more then 2 in the same group is good that one of that person of your group understand and explain to the people didnt get it. The internet is a big problem to alot of us some of us that we dont have internet or computer eather. I think that is a problem for me and one of the reasons that I like working in groups some family doesnt have enough money to put internet in home or buy a computer in home but also go to a public places that have internet and computer we have to pay. But working in group one of the students may have internet and go to that person home. I know that in our school we have computers in the library but on weekends is close the school or some of us we cant stay after school. Because we have to pick our littler brother or sister from other school. But the good thing is that one of us could have computer or internet in home and research some things about our work or project. Another thing that is good working in group is that when we are explaining a project in from in class we dont feel ready because we have to talk a lot or others reasons but in groups we can break parts and each one is going to talk about that part she or he loves more. My Final opinion that I would like to share is that working is group is a good option then working by our self. Because not all of us have the opotunity to have internet, not all of us speak english some of us we need that someone speak our language for example sometimes I need someone that help me with some words in english that I dont understand because my first language is spanish and its hard came to a country that dont speak your native language. And we can know new people to talk, not with the sameones because there is a lot of people that we dont talk and they are in the same classes of us we just want to be with the same ones and have to talk with everyone and help then when they need help.

3,1011,B110268BBFEC,"Albert Schweitzer the philosopher,physician, and humanitarian is great at motivating people by saying, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing. What he means from that is everyone behavior is different. When it comes to behavior anybody could act different. behavior influences some people. when it comes to influence it often affects a person or events. Albert Schweitzer is a very successful man and he probably accomplished that by having influence in him self and believing on what he is capable of. Say one day i was having a rough day and somebody asks me, ""hey, do you want to know something"" or if they are being very annoying your attitude and behavior is going to change into something bad. Yes behavior could change somebody attitude and thats not good and thats what hes trying to say. Albert Schweitzer is setting good examples for people who struggle and people who really needed to hear his example. Everything that Albert said in that quote is very true. Always setting good examples are a good and great way to influence somebody in many ways as what he just told us in his quote. Albert Schweitzer probably learned in the past and maybe thats what hes trying to tell us to watch our future that is ahead of of us in time.

4,907,10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emersons statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what Ive live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and hes happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow. Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasnt accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didnt give up, therefore, he became a dictator. Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you dont reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you dont, thats when life gets too bored, you dont have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day. In conclusion I agree with Emersons statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. Youll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

6,1980,46302B93EF09,"Dear Generic_Name, I know youre still a little young to understand what technology means ,but I believe that technology has had a negative impact on us. Technology has increased the rates of kidnapping, human trafficking ,sexual abuse ,and murder. Due to technology we are also losing our eye sight. It has also limited our communication skills . Young adults usually download dating apps to meet new people ,but they dont understand the risk they can get them self into. For example they usually meet someone online and start talking. After awhile the guy probably ask her out on a date to go for a dinner ,and of course the girl is going to say yes because shes interest in the guy. Few days later the guy ask her out on another date to go and watch a movie ,but he says that hes going to pick her up; and that were it all start she get in the car thinking he going to take her to the movies ,but instead hes taking her somewhere else hes going to kidnapping her and she doesnt know. she goes missing for weeks and no one knows where shes at. A few days later they find her body dead. Now in day more and more people are using glasses. Technology is ruining our eye vision. People that work in offices are more likely to be using glasses now in day. They sit all day looking that their computer ,but they dont realize that their eye sight is getting bad. Young adults are also using glasses too because they use their phone to much or watch to much TV . One way to prevent that is you could put your light dimer on your computer and phone. You could also set your self a limit for how long youre going to use your phone or computer. Another reason why technology is bad because it limits our communication skills. More people are getting used to working independently. Teacher will usually give us a project assignment; we can either work with a partner or work independently. Most students like to work independently because they dont like to rely on someone else finishing the part they had to work on for the project and not doing it. We are also able to text or video chat with other people instead of talking to them in person. By talking to someone in person it can also increase your self esteem. In conclusion these are my reason why I believe that technology is not good for us. Technology has impacted us a lot in society. We need to be more careful and caution about the new technology we are going to be inventing in the future. we also need to be careful with the action we take. No one can predict what going to happen in the future.",8,6,8,8,6,7,915,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
7,1155,5C764A810680,"Do you want your child home school to adopt the four-day school week and extend the schools hours? I do not agree with schools extending the schools hours nor adopting a four-day week. Some students have just do not like what they are doing in class or do not get the chapter, so they get others students to do it for them. They can get a lot of homework, so if they extend the school day they are going to have more homework than usual and be tired. Students can get home late and cannot spend time with their families, if they have a lot of homework. Within four-day school week students can get stressed out worst than usual. The way that parent can react for adding more hours. First, some people act like they do not know what they are doing, just because they are lazy. In my opinion, some students like others students to do their work and that is not fair for the other student. Allowing to extend the schools hours is going to mess people schedule or their parents work schedule. Some parents get out of work early and they got time to pick their child up, if we extend the schools hours that could really mess them up. Students are so much smarter if they focus on what they want. I believe that once you put your mind to it, you will get it. Next, parents do not like their child to get home so tired. Some parents like to know how was their day or how their grades look like, but if a student is tired all the time how she or he suppose to have good grades? Sleep is one of the most important things that a human being needs. A human cannot go long without sleep. Parents like to see their child happy, with energy, and doing things that she or he likes If students do not have the sleep they need to have, that is going to mess with his or her grades. School is hard itself and I do not think adding more hours is going to be helpful. Finally, getting home late and stressing out are one of the worst things ever. Stress can lead you to have some type of illness in the future. What some people do to release stress is that they get a day to themselves and go to a spa or shopping. Other people get things done first and they would like to shopping or to do something they like such as going to the movies, play video games, and play any sport. Students get a lot of homework in a week, imagine in a four-day week. People should really think first what they are going to do and get it done. Some people just like taking everything as a joke and that is not good, but that is on them. In my opinion just do it, just get it done and get it over with. Some people just get lazy but they still get it done. No matter whats on your way, you can always get things done. When getting home late from school or any activity all you want to so is rest. Some people go to sleep knowing that they have homework or a test the very next day, if they did not study or got their homework done, they might have a zero or both things. That is why I think it is important to study and not to adopt the four-day school week. In conclusion, conserving energy and resources has a lot of benefits, but I do not agree with adding hours to school. Students have it so much harder now days that I think extending the school day is going to be even worst. Some disadvantages are people get stress easily, they will have a lot of homework, and finally they can get home late especially if they have to stay after school. Honestly people who agree on this have their good or bad reasons, but these are my reason why we should agree to extend the schools hours nor adopting the four-day school week. However, just do whats have to be done for you to accomplish your dream. If they add more hours to the school or not, do not worry just focus on you.",7,5,6,5,7,7,1195,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
8,1259,5EFF1BA0FBC1,"Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people dont wanna stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work. I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add a after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barley have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework,or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day .And they will probably be grumpy or stressed. My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we wont get to learn anything. And dont forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work. So i think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like peoples sleep schedule,The time they might go somewhere. So over all i think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects,and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced. But if they did change it then we would have to get used to changing our sleep time and doing school work.",8,7,7,7,8,8,1225,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
9,2688,E8E07D453C9B,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks, without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends. The first reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we cant talk with our families that are in long distance. And we dont know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. Thats why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because its important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you cant go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you cant come today, if there was no technology it wasnt possible to do these things. Second reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However thats good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you cant drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money. Third reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you dont know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you cant ask question because you dont know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you cant talk or ask them for help. Thats when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator. Technology had positive effects on peoples lives technology helps people with more stuff, and they can use technology as a useful thing we use technology for everything.",6,4,6,6,5,4,3381,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas. As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work. My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesnt. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done. To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial. I choose working in group because their are many advantages.

I could see the nice green grass moving side to side, smell the fresh air, and see the pretty nice tall green trees giving a nice long shadow to the ground. I can tell people were having a lot of fun by their smiles on their face, and by running up and down the field. I can see people are having fun it made me want to have fun too. I remember the first time I went to the Community Park, then I went to the State Park, and also I went to the National Park. The first reason, is when I went to the the Community Park for the first time. I could see this big blue, and yellow playground. Also I could see people running up and down at the Community Park having so much of fun. There was also other people playing tag with other people at the park. Lastly, the Community Park had so many fun equipment to play. Like the swing, slides, wall climbers and the monkey bars. There were a lot of people there so we had to wait for our turn to use every equipment they had at the Community Park. Second reason, is when I went to the State Park for the first time too. I could remember walking under the trees with a nice wind blow to my face in a nice shadow made by the trees. Also I kept walking and I saw a lot of animals that were not attacking people. Animals that I saw were Frogs, Turtle, Fish, Lobsters, Birds, Snakes, Deer, and Ducks all over the park. Lastly, I saw their was a big river where people were fishing. Then Other people were swimming in the river water because it was a very hot day outside at the park. Last reason, is when I went to the National Park for the first time also. The park has a lot of fun things that we can go look at and visit animals at the park. The animals they can go and visit are Monkeys, Snakes, Giraffes, Turtles, Tigers, Pandas, Birds, Frogs, Crocodiles, Gorillas, Sea Lions, Donkeys, Horses, Lions, Lizards, Iguana, and Elephants. Lastly, the National Park has food stands were we can go and buy food if we get hungry at anytime. We can take brakes if we get tired of walking in the National Park and sit down. In conclusion, enjoying the outdoors is very fun because we can go and visit a lot of different Parks. I will never forget the first time I went to the Community Park, State Park, and the National Park because its a very fun way to enjoy the outdoors day.

12,2159,A53DEC5A2DE8,"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone. Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it. The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity its more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you dont know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do. Another reason, why working with someones else its better. Sometimes student dont like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students dont really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and dont let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher. Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because its fun. Working in a group its more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. Its always nice meeting new people and getting to know them. And if they are from different country or different culture. It is clear for me i would work with a group than working alone.",7,6,6,5,6,7,2218,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Also, something kind of the same happened to me some time ago when my father was teaching me how to drive, and every time I did something wrong he yelled at me and one day I was with a really bad attitude because of that and than I realized that been mad was not going to help me so i changed my attitude and i learn to drive really fast. Been mad only makes us worst at doing that because we are not thinking about the positive thinks of that activity just at the negative thinks and thats what makes everything worst.

14,2979,78A3B43DFF8E,"Former British Prime Mrimister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going failure to failure loss of enthusiasm. ""Do you agree with of Churchils statment about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success ? Take a position on this question. Use reasons and specific examples to support your ideas. Yes I agree. The Failure in My life. The failure in the life is just the first step of counsel to success. From experince , Im saying yes that the failure makes my life better. like when I came America with zero English that was the biggest straggle in my counsel. As emyplee , student and self developing. Emyplee. First, as emyplee it was not easy to find job because of English language. So way where was applying for jobs the company require have whether Spinsh or English so I can not speak any of other, for tow year I was just home, job no money to help my family back home because of language But I did not stop after two years fund a job so I was dishwasher, it was too tough to communicate with my Mangers and employees too. They were making fun of me when I spook English. But that never stop me from what I want to do. Now Im a superior in the pace I work for it. I did not let the language or anythings else to stop me back from what would me my life best. School and Study . Second , as student that was the hardest than that I though . No back round of school like knowledge or education because I never been in the school in my childhood so that made it for me so difficult to understand what the teachers were saying. So another attack of failure in my way, I did not no how to study because there was no one to help me what should I do in that time so fall at school. Because of what other people were saying about me like that impossible that you can go further than that you are now which is can not get high school diploma there were a lot of failure in my life .From failure to a big surprise that I making this year, I will be my graduation form high school and the nest will be collage. Because I do not what let other people make decision of what should I do or not. Self development Third was to wake to believe of myself and to make nay decision. there were a lot of pressure no me . I could not focus with what I was doing like school and work and other thing because of people around me. I could not eat well for two years and I got sick. All my families were worry about me. So over and over I fall of everything. And one day I asked one of my friend what you did to be successful in your life. she said be yourself and if you are important to yourself that will makes it different. That word change my life to think positive. Nothing can make me stay a way from what make me successful. And the end, as human our enthusiasm can make us stronger then failure. We have to look what other people did in the life because of enthusiasm. As human we can learn anyn things that we thought that is hard to learn it.

Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time. When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin. Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting. Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience. They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.

17,2756,A1B06DEEA15C,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, that failure plays an important role for some people in life, If they fail once they could get it right the second time and succeed. People will learn from their mistakes and it will take time for people to be successful in their life and accepted that they failed for the first time. Its very important for people to know that if they fail they can try again and can go back and check to see what was wrong or think to them self what they did wrong, They can learn from their mistakes and not give up when they fail the first time. People that have failed in life know that its not a bad thing when they fail. Its actually a good thing to fail in life and people that know what its like to fail would get inspired to work extra hard and take more time to look over everything. They would also stay on the positive side and have family, friends, and other people supporting them and cheering for them no matter what happens if they fail or dont fail. The British prime minister probably has fail in the past years when he was younger and was successful after he learned from his mistakes. Nobody is perfect in life thats why we fail in life to see what we did wrong and make sure that it doesnt happened in the future. Here is one example, If someone wants to open a coffee shop the person would need to get a loan from the bank so they can purchase a building and to start their own coffee shop business and come up with the names for the coffee shop, drinks, pastries, and food that will be on the menu. People that have wanted to start their own coffee shop business or other kinds of business, doesnt always work out for them for some reasons and are not very successful when doing the planing their ideas and would want to hire someone to help them come up with more ideas. The person might not be happy when he or she were unsuccessful for the first time to try and open their own business and take a few more months to come up with more ideas to be more successful for the second time. Overall, I think that failing is good thing and not a bad thing its just people dont have to give up after they fail the first time they need to give another second chances until they get it right. People should get inspire to keep working hard when they fail and not quit, because not everyone in the world is perfect in life.

On the other hand success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success is gain through those who choose to succeed and you do not need to fail in order to succeed. Working hard towards success without losing enthusiasm is important because you have to be patient and sometimes we can be inpatient so, we loss our enthusiasm we will loss interest and will no longer be motivated to succeed. Enthusiasm is strong warmth of feeling interest. Failing is alright because to succeed you are going to fail and you learn from your lesson, try again, and move on. On the contrary side success is obtained to those who seek it. Studies show that 78.2% of people dont succeed because they chose to be comfortable and not motivate themselves.

26,3297,BF0AF86DFDE1,"I agree with the plan of having an afterschool homework club. Because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. Also some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. Although if their is no afterschool homework club that may be good because students cant get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and your hardest. Another good reason that I think might be good for having afterschool homework clubs is that sudnets get a chance to enteract with other students and they also get a chance to veiw or examine how the other students do their own homework. Some kids migh take advantage of having afterschool homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. So I think if the afterschool homework club shouldnt let students look at each others work until they are done. And some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. But there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. They do not play around,joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do.

27,1882,45E5B6DE09E9,"One of the most frequently debated questions in todays society is whether or not first impression are possible to change. Many people argue that first impression are almost impossible to change. They say that is not possible and inevitable. I disagree with the statement. I believe that first impressions can be can be changed because we cannot judge people just by looking at them, everyone has different viewpoints, and we dont know the struggles that the other people are going through. Words can also hurt! The first reason as to why i disagree with the statement is because we cannot judge people from first impressions. The way people act or interact is not essential information to see the intellectual development and capacity of those individuals who are being judge. There is a famous quote that says, ""Our words can sometimes hurt even more than a punch."" We all can relate to this, sometimes the words that other people use to express are very damaging and hard to listen; even when is just a silly joke that one of your friends is saying. Nevertheless, everyone has different perspectives and view points, but just because we may think differently, doesnt mean we have to get driven by our perceptions or speculations. There are millions of people in this planet, and every single one of us think and look different. We are all not the same. The complementary diversity we have nowadays is a great example of this. It is good to have a great range of diversity, but the race we all come from cannot define us, nor the judgments that other people make from us. The last and final reason is that we dont know the struggles that the other person is going through. Sometimes, we may look tired, weary, or even depressed. Sometimes we are having problems with our families or with our own selves. The judgments we make can potentially affect those individuals life. Sometime we make decisions without thinking about consequences or how those decisions are going to impact others. Decisions, such as the judgments from different speculations we make. As you have read, I disagree with the statement. I believe that the judgment from our first impressions is not inevitable. We are capable to change our own perception from other people that can potentially affect their lives throughout the struggles that he or she may be facing.",9,9,9,9,9,8,910,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
28,3626,77FAA33476CA,"Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I dont mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know whats right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what. What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems. In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person. This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they dont want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they dont want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they dont need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often. Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why its importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice dont think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. Again by attention I dont mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know whats right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

Seeking multiple opinion can benefit you make new friends, have good relationship with your friends and make someone trust in you to tell their secret to you. Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion. Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example, if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you. Seeking multiple opinion can make you have good relationship with someone. Having a good relationship with someone is a good thing to do in life. Having a good relationship with someone can make him or her get close to you .

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices. Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful. Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.,7,7,6,7,7,5,1958,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
35,2715,911DD337DD61,"In my opinion, students should take electives instead of music, drama, or arts. Some students may dislike to be in music or drama because they dont have experience to be singing or drawing. They should focus on what they are good at for themselves. One reason that students should take electives, they will pay attention to their classes and finish up their work to get the credit. Some students cant multi-task if they do drama class and math at the same time. They would have to focus on the important things that theyre good at. Students shouldnt be wasting time on taking drama or music classes because they may not be interested in doing those classes. Itll be easier for the students to learn more with their assignments, instead of worrying about arts or dram classes. For example, during in my junior year, the school wanted me to take art and music. I never wanted to take art because I knew I would be awful at drawing and fail the class. I had to take music also, I was horrible playing the guitar and I was failing in that class. Ive told the teacher that I couldnt take art nor music because I wasnt great at it. I just wanted to focus on my course classes, so that I can graduate and get pass all my classes to graduate my year. Second reason that students shouldnt take it, they will finish with their course classes and will get to graduate their year. Its hard when some students cant do what others can do at drama or musics. Itll be the best opportunity for the students to focus and work hard on their course classes. They should not worry about the electives because that can be done at the end of the year. They wont have to stress about their grades to be below F if they dont take the electives. They wouldnt stress about taking electives and course classes at the same time because itll stress them out. Last reason, students shouldnt take advantage of making themselves work more as they are now. They should only worry about their course classes because those are the only classes that will make them graduate. Some students have no talent or experienced to do art or to be in musics classes. Its better for them to finish their course classes and then at the end, they can take their electives. Therefore, these are the reasons why students shouldnt be required to take classes in arts, musics, or drama.

If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that. Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for.

If you continue with good behavior you have a higher chance that you will be respected in society even in your own home. good behavior is really a life skill you need for example, your trying to get a job, how are you going to behave in front of the employer? your going to act like a mature adult and tell him that your looking for a job so you can buy a house or a car. so you need to behave correctly in any given situation. It can be hard to behave correctly because some people are very disrespectful and like to get on other peoples nerves, but in the end your the one that set a example to everyone else that you know how to act in any situation. dont let other people get to you because then your going to justlash out on everyone else and thats going to make you look bad no matter what. you hsve to show that you are well behaved in any type of enviroment weather its at your house or at work or even at the movie theater you still have to show that you know how to act.

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest students in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didnt have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldnt skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldnt do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. thats something I will remeber the rest of my life. We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what its we are going to get something back recompense. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesnt have money to buy some food or maybe he doesnt have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didnt know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""Im living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever. We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, thats when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didnt know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourselfs. Getting more by doing something, is better than dont do anything expecting that we are going to get something. By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another persons , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it. Its important for people to know that in this life they can have the opportunity to accomplish everything that they want tio improved their life ,but also at the same time they have to know that to accomplish something they have to work hard , have confidence, and they get everything they want in this life.",7,7,8,7,7,6,3224,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
43,3798,01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like. Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they cant stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions. Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law. I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well. In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",6,8,6,8,7,6,18,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

47,1568,C8DF8FD0D69D,"""Succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss enthusiasm"". -Former British Minister Winston Churchill Immigrants who came from differents countries to United States are the most strongest people in the world. These people really know what failure means and how brave they are to leave their families and find the success that they could not get on their countries. Thats the meaning of this statement and Ill explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase. I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America. Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries. They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes, sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not. Im agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price. I hope you have an idea about this statement means , and do not give up on your dreams and the goals that you made some day thinking about make them reallity and if you always want to triumph you have to spend time on it.

In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesnt want to participate because theyre lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up. I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didnt followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies. If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities. And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesnt want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter.

The libary is a great place as well you can find books that match up with your career ask they libarians to help you find the right book.

You can ask your counsuler any questions to help you set up a plan after you graduate high school, talk about why you choosed this career for you, do you have some experiences with this career yet, what do your parents think about this career that you want to have. Counsulers can help you look for colleges or universities that you wan to attened. You can also have your counsuler set up a meeting with you and your parents to talk and see what they can do for you. If you know anybody who has the same career that you want to have. Have a talk with them and ask he or she questions about what do you do in your job, how much does your job pay you, how much do you make a year, if they can take you where they work at and see the other employees there and have conversations with them. Its good to talk people who has the same career that you are studying for because. They have worked hard to get where they are today and they have jobs that they enjoy doing making money and living their best life. You should start looking for colleges when you are in your junior year of high school because. When you are looking for colleges you have to check how much you have to pay to attend the college, how much do you have to pay a month. Thats why some teenagers start working while they are in high school, so they can start saving money for college. Some parents pay the college for their kids, but i think its better if you pay some of that money with your parents, so they dont have to waste all of their money for you to go college. Some jobs will help you pay for the college that you will be attending at. As we read this is why i think students should start pickcing their future careers while they are in high school because.

Another reason why I would not like it is because Im not getting the same kind of education like most of the other students. I wouldnt have the chance to learn with my classmates or go on trips to historical monuments and historical musuems with them. When youre home schooled youre mostly self-taught. One other reason why I wouldnt reccommend home schooling is because youre not interacting with other students which can cause depression and anxiety. Another reason why home schooling is not such a great idea is because when he learns how to write and read and play a musical instrument and masters soccer, running, or other sports in general how will this particular student learn how to communicate to the real world if the parent has kind of isolated him from meeting people. One of the other reasons why home schooling is bad is because the fact that parents may lose patience when they are trying to educate their children.

I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I dont think its a good idea. But who am I to judge other peoples opinions. So im going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because there either doing school work or there to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

Exercise help our body to stay healthy. However not everyone is agree with this position. Some people belive that stay inactive is more accomplish because doing the same thing can become bored,Doing nothing doesnt help us to progress and be success for the intire life,The students who dont practice any sport or are not involve in any school program have more time to study and rest their maind that can result good in their final grade. Forthemore,be active help us to increase our skils and the practice made an expert because if we are always active in what the teacher tell us to do at school,we can increase and be more and more faster the next time,that also can help to find a job because every boss want a good worker, and also that give us a good reffert because anyone can say good things about us depending on what we have done do far at schools,even outside the school like comunity service. In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world. Moreover,sleep good and having the hours to rest help us to be active the next day dont feeling tired and sleepy because the students have to wake up early on the morning and gives all what they have at the school,everyone want to be a good student and pass the tests and everything,also be active depend in how much energy we have thats way we have to eat on the morning to have energy and be active the all day. Finally,it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something because we can get our goals working hard,students making goals to the end of the school year, stay active help to makes goals and get what we want to the of the school year,stay active can include be participate en class,colarate in a school proyet,sport team,drama,school announcement and everything that involve school learning,after Hig School or in the collage,be active helps to go to the collage because we can get a Beca for our work in Hing School.

56,1033,698A3F2B43B9,"Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. Lots of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they dont start in a young age. In my opinion young students should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young students shouldnt start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family. My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age students can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young students gets lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, students get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kids have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take. My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, students can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they dont have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid wants to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, students knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the students a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, thats a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute. Some would argue that students shouldnt start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kids are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , its nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career. In conclusion, students should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world.

58,2397,985FC4A0FAE2,"Some school are offering distance learning ash an opportunity for a student attend classes from home by way of online or video conference. I think this would be a good idea because is offering a good opportunity for people that can not be able to attend the school during the morning for other occupation personal and give a chance to get the diploma .Also is good opportunity to the people the can not be able to attend classes because they work. Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school thats a lot of benefit for people that dont work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school. Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason. Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you thats helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home. Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they dont have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work. Finally i think this opportunity is huge benefit for the people the dont have the chance to go the school and for those students that need to graduated because they have to do a lot of think but want to get his diploma this can be the best opportunity for those people that want to be some one in his future some people have to work hard every day and they dont have good opportunity to finish they high school but in this school they offering a huge benefit that give to us a opportunity to take classes online thats going to be for me the best opportunity the i never seen before in schools .",5,5,5,4,5,5,2017,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

First of all, you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase. Secondly, some time people love to be a better person but there will be people who doesnt enjoy the time to increase, I just know one thing for sure sometime people like to stay in the same step because if you want to be a winner, you must try and see what you can do to go up, I will try to have a good future, a better future for my family, to have my own things, living failure make you a weak person everyone can see that you are weak, that you are not smart enough , that you are comfortable for what you have, but you must be a ambition person to have more than what you have. Thirdly, if you dont want to live failure you must to win the opportunity, I just know that this world is for smartest people, here survive the person who can use there brain carefully, people who are not making bad mistake but we are humans,m humans make mistake but that is okay you must fix it you must to increase yourself to keep something in your heart that can motivate yourself.

61,994,E28221F47AE3,"Yesterday, I was talking with my parents and they tell me that I have to start thinking about what career I want after I graduate from high school. I start seeing what issues can cause and I think that it is bad idea to select what career I want at this age, because whats is going to happen if I dont like the career that I choose when I was younger or if that career is going to give me the money that Im looking for and what about if my parents are not in conditions to help me pay the career that I want, after think all this I meet with my parents again and I tell them the reasons that why I dont want to select my career at this time. The first reason that I think why is not a good idea to select my career at this age was, what is going to happen if I select one career but after four or five years later I like other career and I really want to be in the other that its totally different from the one that I select five years before, maybe they are going to get mad at me because they are going to say that am just wasting my time or something like that and I dont want that I want to be sure about the career that i get is going to really like me when I get older. The second reason was, who knows that is that career is going to help me in my economy because some career with the time they lose demand on the thing that they are doing and they give you fire or reduce your salary, but if I take my time to think and analyze all the careers that i like that can be better, because everyone wants a job that can provide a good salary and a good benefits and thats what I want, in that way everything is going to be more secure for me that nothing of that issues that I said before is going to happen and my economy stays in good conditions. And the third reason that I think was, what about if I select my career and my parents after the four years that we have to do in high school they dont have the opportunity to help me pay my career and I ready get very excited thats is going to get me very nervous because i didnt think about what other career I want to do. This is why I want more time to think about it and see if my parents can help me to pay the career that I choose, in this way me and my parents dont get frustrated, I for having multiple choices of what careers I like and my parents for paying something that they can afford with their money. In conclusion, I think that it is a really bad idea to let young kids decide what career they want because not all the time it is going to like the same career that we choose when we were younger or what about if after high school you decide to no continued in school because you have to work because your parents need help for paying some stuffs or because you want to buy your own things or just you dont like school anymore, so in my opinion I think its very important to have a lot of time for choose whatever you want to do after you graduate from high school.

63,1208,153C3543E432,"People who value self-reliance defined as the need of each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. Should people make their own decisions about life important matters,or should they ask someone else for their opinion. People should ask for guidance from experts about life important matters. There are times when depression comes and stress appears because,of bad decisions made by one-self. If people do not ask for experts guidance, there is a possibility that in the future the decision they have made, might affect them in the future and cause a fatality like, depression which can lead to deadly thoughts and mental problems like bipolarity. Depression is one of the most know in all over the world which is caused by,bad decisions,over working by mental and physical jobs, family problems, and an unhealthy life style which all of this can lead to suicide thoughts. For example, one of the most famous singers from United States Sia known for her most popular song ""chandelier"", she committed many bad decisions which had lead her to drug addiction. Her fame was getting higher; and many contracts for more shows where she had it to attend to, were exploding her head which lead it to an over working stage. She has an amazing soprano voice, with more than five different tones, and because of that, different music productions wanted to sign a contract with Sia, but she instead of taking a rest she decided to continue, knowing in which stage her body was passing through, she decided to take drugs to cover her stress but, instead of taking away her stress she became a drug addict which lead her to suicide, but thanks to the doctors she is alive; now she keeps being one of the most popular singers but, because of her pass, she covers her face with long hair bangs to the top of her upper lip; and no own has seen her face since that incident. Also, bad decisions might lead to mental problems like bipolarity, and sadly most of the cases are seen in schools where parents and teachers do not notice until is late for that youth to recover, because of his or her bad decisions that this students had made. For example, a student from a school in Virginia known for his great intellectual was passing through a rough time, he had to go to work every single day after school from Monday to Monday his hours to school were from 7:30 Am to 2:15 Pm, and his work hours were from 2:30 PM to 10:30 PM every single day. He never gave up he always was the top student of his class, but there were times where his parents were putting more pressure, and Test were near to come and work was getting more and more exhausted until one day he exploded. The day of hes graduation arrive and his most treasure sister wasnt able to accompany him because she was getting into the same stage that he already pass through. After his graduation he wanted to have a life and do what he always wanted to do since he was a child which was being in the Marine, he was already in a bad state because of all the pressure he gent through but, he wanted to fallow his dream. One Saturday in the morning he decided to apply for the Marine but, sadly he was not accepted because of his migratory circumstances and because of that, hes brain collapsed in a stage of dementia, but his mother instead of giving an affection, she got mad and told him ""Stop, you are a man already, act like one"", the only one who tried to calm him down was his little sister who did not know what to do but to say ""He needs some experts help, he needs to go to see a doctor in that way, we can make a good decision and know what to do"". After all of this happened he went to a mental hospital where he was hospitalized for three long months and now he is living a life with medications from an expert who helped him to go through all of this where he was diagnosed with bipolarity. In conclusion, if someone wants to make a decision which is about their life importance is better to ask an expert and prevent all this things to happen in that way there can be a reduction in mental problems and suicide attempts.",5,5,7,7,7,6,288,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
64,2063,E56D7CC27444,"Some people believe that glorifying a students work might help them build self-steem, even when they have not put a lot of effort into it. They believe that students should be confidents in themselves in so they can learn. Others believe that glorifying a students work that does not have a lot of effort into it lowers their levels of learning. They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it. It would make students think that what they did is perfect and that they do not need to work more on it or to do some more effort to achieve what they want. Although some people might not agree. They would think that it is a good thing to glorify students work only to make them feel confident. However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves. One reason I believe students do not need to be praised on their work is because it would only make them rely on what they have and not work to achieve more results. They will not do more of what they are capable of. In addition, they will not put more effort on what they need to do. They do not need others to praise their work only to make them feel confident with themselves. Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a students work will help them to be self-consident. Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort. Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem. In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",7,8,7,6,6,8,3316,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
65,3615,29905A8482BC,"- Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier. My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home. This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion: Do not have to spend gas going to school. Do not spend in different clothes everyday. The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower. We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work. The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher. This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that dont let you go to school.

66,3729,A68AABEAAB4B,"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they dont treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that its a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer. My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I dont feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really dont want to leave them (the people here are great). In some reasons the people dont treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didnt like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didnt want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didnt even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didnt tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun. The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they cant control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he cant control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem. Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people dont always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thankyou for hearing me today!!

67,2412,1846CE5F244D,"community parks, state parks, and national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities. Write about an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors. Using specific details and examples, explain why someone might find that activity enjoyable. First of all, Let say that you dont really see your family that often, You can take them to the park when they come to your house so you all can spend time together as a family that you dont really see. You can talk to your brothers if you dont see him him or her that often you can take him or her to the park ride around with bikes, Maybe go for a run to burn some calories down so you can stay healthy and in a good shape. And if you have a problem with someone in your family the park is the best way yo go and talk it out, Why because you can smell that fresh and clean air from the outside world you have time to think what you really want to do and talk to your self, If your a religious person that likes talking to god Im telling you go to the park you can talk to him you get everything of your head and you dont think stupid stuffs, Because some people when they are mad or they are sad they just go on their room and lock them self in their room thats not good because you are not breathing clean air like the outside world and the firs things teenagers do is yeah I am a bad boy I am going to smoke with my friends, I ask you this what benefits do you get from doing that? The park is the best way to go and take your stress out and clear your mind. Second If your an athletic and you dont have money to go to the gym or you dont have time, Dont worry about that I have one way for you to stay healthy and on shape by going to the park look there is so much stuffs you can do at the park you can go for a run, push-ups, curl-ups you can Stretch your body, And the good thing is that you are not breathing that air from the Gym and at the park you are breathing clean and fresh air. The best thing is that it is totally free and you can take anyone you want to take and you can see more people there that you dont know you can make more and new friends. Another reason is that If the house you leave in is to small to make a party, Guess what I have the correct spot for you the park you can play music you can make a big party invite us much as people you want to invite. The good thing is that the park has games for kids to play on and other stuffs and they even have food you can go buy food they have a little lake where you can go on little boats of four people and see different stuffs. Why would you want to have a party at your house when you dont know If people are going to come and where is going to be crowded and people might want to leave because there is to much people. When you can have the park because a lot of people like the park because they can go for a walk they can spend time with friends and family and there is a lot of space there is a small lake with boats that can carry four people you can have fun and experience the park. Finally going to the park is good for you I mean I am not going to force you to go to the park but you should go just one time and you will see how cool and beautiful it is you can go with your dog, son, or your daughter, Plus sometimes they make a little concert and a lot of people come and dance with different people and different music. And in the summer they make a little fair and let me tell you man It is amazing, You can try different types of food because people come and sell food and It doesnt cost that much you can smell the delicious food. If you dont want to buy a ticket you can just walk around the park and see the different types of foods and you can go see the ocean and smell the nice wind.",5,5,6,4,6,5,330,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
68,2827,5AC16E188F1B,"Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things. First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for students. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention. Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it. Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school. Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem. At the end non one benefit from this online courses. ",7,7,7,7,7,7,1173,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
69,1444,F5FF5E9E553C,"On september 2, 2015 Generic_Name was entering his first year of high school, and already knew what he wanted to do with his life, and that was to be a doctor, but was having trouble on what kind of doctor he wanted to be. So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school. The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. Thats the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they dont get stressed out too much. If you know what you want to do then youre fine because the more you know the less stress youll be in. If you know what you want to do then youll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you wont have to take extra classes for no reason. Also if you need help dont hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. The more you ask for help the less youll be stressed. Thats the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they dont get stressed out too much. Some people would disagree with me because they think its ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, dont even have a plan, and would just be stressed out. In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Also, so they dont get too stressed out for it. If you know what you want to do then youre fine because the more you know the less stress youll be in. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement.

Off this quote i feel that sometimes in life you can accomplish things with no effort but mostly, in life you gotta work hard to earn and get the things you deserve and have well accomplished in life. Another thing is that you gotta have a really good effort in life to get really far. I agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote on,"" how much maybe be done if we are always doing"" because thats how it has to be done in life , you gotta work for what you want and need, everything is earned in life and its way easier to get things that need to be done quicker by putting your effort and always working, than to just be standing or laying around doing nothing. One main reason i agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote is that you gotta work for what you get in life,you gotta always be doing something to get stuff done. Its an amazing quote that is used in a way that many dont think or have had the thought of. His quote is supporting the fact that it takes hard work and focusing to get work done and that work wont get done on its own. Another reason , is that no matter what you do , you always gotta work in life. To not take things for granted and actualy work and to not be lazy and get no work done that has to be done, done . Itll help out in the long run and make things easier in life by doing what you have to. Thomas Jeffersons qoute is there to incourage others to do great in life and do everything possible to get your goals achivied. This quote is a great figure of speech that can help out in the long run for people in need of it. One last reason i believe thomas jeffersons quote is a great and an amazing quote is that it justifys that life isnt easy and everything isnt free, also that things come with consequences. To also, not take things for granted and be grateful for what you got because thats the amount of effort you put in , instead of just laying down and or doing nothing at all. The quote has a alot of great reasons and thoughts that are put into peoples minds off this one quote it could help motivate someone in need of motivation. In conclussion, Thomas Jeffersons quote can help people that are in need of something to motivate them. To help them by telling them that its fasinating to see what you get out of completing your work by always doing something. Lastly, how easily it is to complete something by moving around and not just sitting and down absolute nothing about your work. Isupport this quote beacuse it well help people understand how life goes and how youre supposed to live in order to be great and wise.",7,7,7,7,6,6,372,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
71,1824,ACE1BE41A8E0,"One of the most famous quote by Thomas Jefferson is, "" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if its little it can be done but may take time. I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you dont practice everyday then you wont get better at soccer. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism. If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. I always believed that i can do a lot if im doing something all the time. When i was little i use to make Legos i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. My mom always told if im building them everyday i could get done fast. I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast. If you dont practice everyday then yo wont get better at soccer. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When you dont do that you wont get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasnt practicing everyday so i didt get any better. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasnt training everyday so i didnt get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. Most people dont make their dreams because they dont do the little things that matter everyday. There is a lot that need to done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. Police officer shooting black men that didnt do anything. That causes people that have been killed familys pain. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because its not fair to the people who died familys. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday. As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. Only when we do something you accomplish more. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe.

I think is not a good idea for a student to commit to a career at a young age. because students are not old enough they careless and not make the best decision when they at a young age. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, students are not old enough to know what they career in specific. they not prepared for the world students in high school dont have any experience of any career. I think is a little to early. I will explore all type of career when my senior junior year starts I would make sure to select the right courses and the better one to be prepared or have experience for your career. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses. One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because, when you are in a young are you make the wrong decision well sometimes but I think the best decision for me during high school is to to wait and study the better classes and the best and better career. and to be able to do that you have to care about classes and be responsible with school and career. As you read you can see the reasons,I think the best idea for students is to focus in high school and get good grades when you get to senior year or college, you know more about life and careers I think that would be the best time to selected the best classes that are gonna guide you toward a specific career.",5,4,6,5,5,5,3645,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

It depend of the schools and the parents, if they approve the extending of the school days and also see if there is any benefits or disadvantages of this. In my opinion it can be a disadvantage for some students, because some of the students have to work after the school and they will not have time for do the homework or projects or even their own free time, and that is why they dont have time for do it,but the most problem of this is; if the parents of the students are going to approve or not about this change to the school, because some of the parents take the education of their son or daughter so serious, and that can be one of the big problems to the schools. But there is too benefits for students or some students only, because they are going to have more time in classes for learn more and also for do the projects in the classroom and not in their houses as homework. Another benefit too is they can have for time for the activities in the school if that was as a class they have. I will approve and disapprove, because there is so many disadvantages of this, but to the same time there is benefits too about this change of the school.

74,3555,BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they dont are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that dont live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really dont matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things dont define you like a person and this aspects dont give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you dont have happiness you dont have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they dont want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people dont can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they dont be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are dont be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward. Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they. First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself. Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their lifes or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they dont are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy. Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself. Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person dont have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that dont have that be equal and that its fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, dont care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down. Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that dont accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and dont allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal. Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive. Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.

People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you. When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You cant have character if you dont want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you.

Everyone can different trait and same one. You can never find someone with all the same traits. People see them in other and copy. People learn from them selves and make them. Traits are something you learn and keep. Now if traits were something beyond your control thats different. If something beyond are control was doing this youd think different. If you are talking about TV thats cool yeah I think so but not like that. TV is kinda like school but a lot of different things. You learn a lot of things from the TV that arent the same. So you build off that. If you are talking like someone controlling of thats a whole different story. People would be more a like and thats how you tell we are in control. People make their on character always. People will always be different from others . We all want to be are own person in the near future. Who wants to be someone else thats boring.

I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts dont change. In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it. Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldnt be together. Your mind wont change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way. So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

Failure is always there, a lot of times we thing failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you efor even much harder situations, if you dont fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress. Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it give you choices and failure let you know the things you couldve done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didnt know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but i didnt give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kicked it with more precission. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way. Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail and you are beaten down and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesnt give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it.

What i didnt know was he was having a bad day. After a while he started to feel better and being nice to others, and I realize he was good person. Another example is when i transfer from Generic_School to Generic_School i fougth it was going to be horrible. I have to start from zero like meeting new teachers and new people and knowing the school. After a week the teacher and people i met were nice and good people. I didnt like idea of transfering of schools and leaving the people i know from Generic_School. For some other people the first impression is impossible to change. Like when companies are looking for people to hire but they want people that are self condifent,hard working,resposible. If a person dont show any good impression in their interview most likely is not going to get hired. However, people can change impressions over time. Like in the If a person didnt show a great impression in the job interview giving them a change it might change their first impression. I think it is possible to change first impression.

86,2442,0D382343F3D7,"Why do curfews interfere with young peoples lives? For some people, they have to stay at work really late because of this reason. A curfew could really mess up someones life when theyre doing something important. No wonder why curfews interfere with young peoples lives and heres the reason. Curfews interfere with young peoples lives because they have to stay at work very late, have to intended to something , and have fun with their friends. However, some people dont agree with this position. They think that a curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble. For example, When the teenager comes home on time, their mother wouldnt be scared where they have gone and why they stay out late. So, this explains why the council thinks that a curfew to young peoples lives could get them out of trouble. However, young people still consider that having a curfew could interfere with their lives and heres the first reason. Going home on time when theyre at work is impossible. For example, some people working at a restaurant stay late some times because of cleaning the dirty dishes or taking a long time to do their side jobs. Also, when theyre working for the government, they have to stay really late because of paper work or something urgent. This shows that having a curfew could make young people really stressed because they would have to rush their side jobs and get home in time. That is one good reason why they shouldnt adopt the curfew and heres the next one. A lot of young people have things to do when theyre out . For example, when the teenagers are in a play, they cant stop the play until its finished or they will ruin the play. When theyre at a school dance,they cant leave if theyre participating the dance or they have a date. Young people sometimes have things to do after hours or want to go and participate. Thats another good reason why the council shouldnt adopted the curfew and heres the last reason. For teenagers, they just want to have fun and stay out late. For example, teenagers like to drive out very late with their friends or drink with them. Also, play games with their friends and stay up until they finish a level or a quest at a arcade or Dave and Busters. A lot of teenagers dont always sleep on time when theyre having fun. That sums everything and heres the closing. In conclusion, this stats that curfews interfere young peoples lives because of them working very late. Also, when, theyre intending in an event. Lastly, when theyre having fun with their friends. This shows that curfews interfere with young peoples lives. They can stay out as long as they like, its their life.",8,8,7,7,8,8,175,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

For example if some students have to work , and because their works schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities.

There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study, when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done. So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.",8,5,8,6,7,7,277,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 5, cohesion 8"
88,1331,DF9E11F7A06E,"Ralph Waldo Emerson says""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow.""On one hand,some people disagree with statement. On the other hand,some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow,it makes them feel good,and make their live easier. However,not everybody agree with position,some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they dont want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless,this opposition other important,namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example,my biggest fear in live is airplanes and i never been on it,but if i try it for the first time in my live even i scare or not next time,i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and i try it. I could do more. Further more, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live. In addition,it makes us feel good. For instance,my cousin was always sad and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming,everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time,she try it. On that time,my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus,people should try new things to make them feel good and happy. Finally,it makes the live easy. To illustrate,if someone be so strike in live and doesnt wants to try something beyond what he/she already mastered,that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover,we should get out of our comfort zone so we could have an easy live. Based on this argument,one must conclude,people never get better unless they try new things in live.

Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Hes because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emersons statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said ""You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"". Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they dont continue their survey. Finally as you can see, Emersons statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.

90,1679,E1EC4869981F,"The decision that the principal made that students should get involved in the activities is an unethical idea. Who would like to waste their time doing something that is not really beneficial? At school students have a lot of works to do, and now being in another activity might have a bad affect in their academic goals. If a student get involved with the activities they wont have time for there daily work. They will have less time to do their homework or projects. This can keep students away from their academic goals. They also wont have much time to spend with family. which means that there will be problems with those relationships, and there will be separations between there family. Getting involved in these activities brings stress for students. There will be one extra program added in their daily routine, Which contains more work. The work that they didnt choose to do, but the have to do. By having stress after this much work students wont get enough sleep, Which is an unhealthy situation. Having this much pressure can affect studentss grades. By spending their time on something that they dont really want to do, but they have to can put them in a lot of pressure which keeps them away from what they want to do. They will join these activities and wont focus on their studies. Students will start getting bad grades.

We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime Many student dont like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I dont think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they dont pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life. Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience. In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more.

I think that students should have a positive attitude because. it might make them forget why they were even upset in the first place. They can also brighten someones day by giving them a compliment or just as little as smiling at someone. Also if you have a positive attitude you can accomplish your goals. Therefore if you have a positive mindset not only can you achieve and accomplish your goals. You can be proud of who you have become and your hard work. Once youve done everything you dreamt of achieving. Your parents would be so proud. Having a positive mindset encourages young children to treat everyone with respect. And children could learn from the elderly and mimick their actions and words.

My school should not follow this model or even consider extending the school day by two hours. At my school a full day of school consists of seven hours.

Also most students have a part time job after school and wont fit everyones schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help.

Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isnt picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired. So it would not benefit the students much , by adding the two hours. It will most likely have the students failing, because theyre not leaning or doing their work.

94,1854,EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to "" The Washington Post, "" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important. The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Names goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic. She wake up every morning at 6:00 oclock to go school, and she always fought for have a better future and accomplished her goals. Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job. The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in Villages Company . He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Villages Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Villages Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs. In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life. We can show a lot characters in our work such as: be respecfull, be on time, and the most important things is love our jobs.",7,7,8,8,5,7,3518,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
95,3741,D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy. For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades. My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng 2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school. I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle. ",5,5,6,6,4,5,2928,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
96,2699,DDD3771E1DF6,"Many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. I do not agree with them. It is important to listen what other people think about it. Each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. I believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before. One of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. For example, You are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but youve also wanted to play piano since you were 6 years old. Your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from Monday to Wednesday after school, and swimming classes every Friday after school, but you have to work from Thursday to Sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every Monday and Wednesday after school ,and Swimming classes every Tuesday after school .You believe that is what best suits for you. Another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. Another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to Canada for spring break or going to The Bahamas for Christmas break. Generic_Name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to Canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .You tell your parents that youve decided to go to Canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision youve taken. Thanks to your friends advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion. On the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. A simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. The first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; You cannot blame on somebody else except for you. In conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. All persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. Humans are not perfect and we do not always take the best decisions in our life; but with help from others , we will be able to make them right and move on.",7,7,8,7,7,6,3148,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

When i was in my home country schools was only for six hours i disagree that schools extend two hours a day because the students will lost their focus, teachers will get tired from standing more than two hours, and some of the student will change their high school. The student will lost their focus for example when i was in Afghanistan our school was from 8 to 12 and we where tired from listening to teachers. However, when i came to united state it was tough for many reason. for instance When i came to united state it was so hard for me to get up at six and come home at two o clock. In addition if we have school ten hours of school each day the student and the people who work inside the school they all will get tired of school and student will not learn the teachers will get tired of teaching ten hours a day. Teachers will get tired of sanding for example they teach more than two hundred student a day so they will get tired and they teach for tomorrow. Once students get tired they will lost the focus form the teachers and they will start to talking with each other playing around the classroom or they will using their cell phones taxing their friends planning to skip their classes or panning to drop out of schools. The student will not get everything in their mind they will forget it for the next day. Maybe some student come to school and stay at school longer than seven hours a day but maybe some student cant stay longer than seven hours a day because maybe they work after school or maybe doing some think at home for example maybe they take cares of their little brothers or sisters or maybe they clean up the house.

Some students will change their schools because they doesnt want to be at schools more than six or seven hours a day. And also those who works in the schools it will be hard for them to clean up the schools the bad rooms or to cook food for students and than after that they have to wash ever think for next students that are coming after A lunch. In conclusion, imagine you dismiss on the usual time of school. I wish that we dismiss from school on the usual time.

Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision. Lets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didnt like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class. Second, start with the negative reasons. It wont be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class its likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, its going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life. So I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.

A lots of people think that if they dont do it in the first time, thats going to be it. They dont realize that if they just keep going theyre going to get there, and be success. Wouldnt it be great if we didnt have to fail? but thats how its some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want. Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, thats the most important reason of all of this. if we dont have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. For example, I used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didnt want to be a doctor. He wanted to be a teacher. Farthermore, he study to be a doctor. He wasnt that good but that was what his mom wanted. The second year, which was even harder he just stop. He talked to his mom saying that was not for him. He did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. He did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs. In short, he never lost the enthusiasm to be a what he wanted. Some people migth say that you dont have to fail, that you have to be success all the time. They migth say that is not ok to fail. However, thats not true, you can fail its going to make you strong. you are going to have experience and youre going to do things so much better.

Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK. When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People dont like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self. Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person. Yes, honesty can hurt them,but, lying hurts the most.

Each person have different opinions, and we have to respect it. Working in groups help to have everything done on time, since we are gathering many types of ideas and information from everyone. For example, in USA there are a diversity of people from different parts around the world, and each person have a different opinions and ideas in how they see everything. However, some people think that they have better opinions about what they are doing than others, but an opinion or idea is just a help that can guide to the best option. Having groups in classes is a help that can benefit. Because, they are helping each other. When someone is working alone can be struggling and do not ask for any type of help to keep going and make things nicely. When we are working in groups, we can establish a good environment with our classmates, since there is a lot of communication between classmates. For example, if we work alone, we would not be able to communicate each other, because, everyone is concentrate in what are they doing. Otherwise, people from different parts of the country would not have the opportunities to meet each other and learn different cultures from their classmates. Knowing each other can create a calm and gradable place to stay and share with every student in the classroom. Even other students would prefer to be there. Many people would like to be in a place where they can share and work together.

If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because: it could impress the collages theyd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time It would also be a great benefit for students whod join the work force instead of collage because: they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work theyd have a head start on their life The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year. in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.",6,7,6,7,7,7,1647,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
107,3189,529A633179FF,"Have you ever wondered about the importants and the difference between imagination and knowledge? Knowledge and imagination are both very important but I think knowledge is more important. Imagination is like thinking about something, or putting your self in that situation, while knowledge is an understanding gained by actual experience and it is also known as something learned and kept in your mind. Knowledge helps a lot of people to get jobs so everyone should try to get a knowledge so they can use it to help other people that dont have a very good knowledge. Majority of all the humans in the world get their knowledge from schools. They either get it from a public school which is made by the government or they get their knowledge from a private school which is made by and individual, or a group of people. Schools provide knowledge to students by putting them in classes with students that are their age. you need knowledge to give the students the information you learned, you cant be selfish with you knowledge because you must have been thought by some one, or you must have used someones resources to be intelligent. So if you a good education help other people that are not as smart as you because they can help you when you need it in life. If there was no knowledge in the world there will be no electronic devices that we can use, there will be no new inventions. We are gonna need more doctors to study and find out the cures to all the new diseases that is spreading around the world thats why we have schools and teachers to help. I think all knowledge should be free from first grade to the end of your college year. having to pay for college education makes a lot of students drop out and do drugs and they always get addicted to drugs and alcohol they even try to be you tubers or rappers which must of the time does not work. finally I disagree that imagination is more important than knowledge. So if you have a good knowledge you should be proud to share it with others. Imagination i also good for you but you should focus more on getting you knowledge so you can help others. helping others makes makes you feel much better about your self and it makes you day better.",6,7,8,7,6,7,1078,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience. Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings. Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better. Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others. While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

Eventually, you will learn how to spend your precious time wisely. Additionally, it will lead you to good decisions. Basically solving problems is like, when you have to make a wise decision.

Although some people may hate setting a goal high and falling short, it can cause a person to give up, but they forget to neglect the part that goals or achievements come in different shapes and sizes. People should be aiming their achievements high because people can achieve more, people can feel more motivated, and people can feel more successful. Some people may not agree with this position because setting a goal to high and then falling short can cause a person to feel less motivated. they believe this because when setting a goal high and it fails, it can make a person give up and not try. they may think this because when giving up on a goal it can cause a person to feel empty and wanting to not try again. this shows that some people are afraid of failing, and when they do fail it makes them not try again. However, the oppositions looks over other important points. People should be aiming their achievements high so they can achieve more. when a person sets their goal high, it could mean they are setting multiple goals and not just one, having one goal is great, but having multiple is also fantastic. this can also make the person feel good about themselves, knowing that they have accomplished more than one achievement. it can also make them feel proud about themselves. Even if a person failed one goal that doesnt mean they cant accomplish other goals. People cannot accomplish every goal, all goals are different then one another, but other harder goals can be accomplished. people should be aiming their achievement high because it can make a person feel more successful. Once a person has completed an achievement it can make them as if they succeeded. it can also help with their confidence, it would give them less anxiety. it also shows that the person who is working towards his or her achievement can do so much more. it can also help some people in the future because they have the confidence they need because they hit different goals. people can also feel like they did something with their life and not feel like they did not accomplish anything in life. People should aim their achievements high because they can feel more motivated. Setting an achievement means working really hard. It means you must focus on, it should be the only thing you are working on. Most people in their mind focus on this and this is what motivates them to work on one persons goal. In their brain they get this sense of energy, their brain is telling them to work on their goal. that is what make some people want to work towards their goal or try to finish their goal. So this is why aiming your goal high is a good thing, motivation, success and achieving more can help a person in life if trying complete an achievement. People can get scared of goals, they are afraid it could fail something could go wrong, but the thing is in life you will fail, nobody is perfect, people will have get over their fears and accomplish their goal.

When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her fathers house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first.

The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didnt have any one to protect them .Generic_Name dint want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said hes waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said.

Although some say it is good idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students can to learn more, actualiy it is a bad idea for students to commit to a career to young age because the students dont have time for explore new things and they dont have time for fun in the high school. Some person belive that is is a good idea for students to commit a career to young age. One reason is because the students can to learn more in a specifit environment. For example, the students who choice a career by time they enter high school. They have a idea about the class they want to take. For this reason, when they finish high school they are more prepared. A 35% the students choose a career to youn age because they think it is help for your future. However, it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because they dont have the opportunity to explore new things. For example, in the high school the students have the opportunity to choose 2 or 3 elective class. this clas to help the student to find or explore a new hobby,and some time this class to help to discover what do yuo like or what do you want in the future. In my opinion, I think that this class are good for the students who not have a idea what they want to study in the future. For example, I want to learn to play guitar and I take the music class, but I discover I am so bad in this type of class. My second year I take a math class and I discover taht I love math and I think that I want to continue to learn about this class. The other reason is it is bad idea for students to commit a career to young age because the student dont have time for fun. One reason is that students is only focus his study and they dont pay atention her and his friends. they are worry because they have -B in your class or they dont make the homework. In my pinion, It is good that they are worry for your grade, but they need time to fun because tha teacher and old people think taht is good that students take a breack (rest landing) some times.

113,3581,E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you wont grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing? First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldnt you want to challenge yourself with new things? Its good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things. Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You cant master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good. Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be. However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you dont work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you dont do that than you would struggle a lot in life. In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and dont want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because youre going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldnt it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",8,6,7,7,7,7,3396,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
114,2578,68685615FE0C,"There is a debate about the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing. Some people believe that the best way to learn is going to the school independently if the student live close or far and participating with more students in the classes. Other people believe that no matter on what way you receive a class, you always have the opportunity to learn something new. I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn, because the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. First reason why I believe giving the opportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student can pay more attention. Sometimes when you are in a classroom with more than 20 students is really hard focusing on what the teacher is talking about, because there are always some students who really like to make fun of the teacher, laugh with other students, interrupt the class with questions like ""can I use the restroom?"", and in someway you cannot even take notes; but when you are at home, all by yourself, without any distracction you can really be sure that you are paying atenttion and taking notes. Second reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily. For example, lets say that you are in a classroom with a bunch of students, each of them have differents questions about the class, and the teacher said that he is going to answer each question by alphabetical order, unfortunately, your las name is ""Generic_Name"". In this case one of the best way to get that question answer as soon as possible, is having a conference class between you and the teacher. Third and last reason why I believe giving the oportunity to students that live far from the schools can take the classes by way of online or video conferencing is a great way to learn because the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. There are some cases where a student just have one class every day; what if this student live half an hour away from the school, it would be way more easy if this student can take all his classes in two days online, also, this can be a great oportunity to have a job while you are studying. In conclusion, the opportunity offered by the schools for the students who live far, to receive classes without going to the school by way of online or video conferencing is so great, beacuse the student can pay more attention being alone, if the student have questions the teacher can answer them easily, and the student do not have to waist time going to the school just for one class. So, this opportunity offered by the schools to give this type of classes can motivate each student that live far to not excuse themselves to not finish a class, also, each school that do not have this classes should considered create them.

115,1866,1E4E4216EB39,"I believe that schools should not adopt to a four day work week each consisting of ten hours. ten hours of school in one day is too much for a student. not only is this too much time for a student, but it would interfere with sports and clubs that they do. on top of that some students also have jobs that they have during the day. For some students sports and clubs mean so much to them. they might want that sport as a career. if student were to do the four day work week it would effect them physically and mentally. students might not even make it on time to that four oclock practice or that very important meeting because of the ten hours. being late, not getting much playing time in the sport you wanna exceed in, and worried about school work that you have to make up,and that could lead up to stress. ten hours in school is a lot of time and that could be too much for a student, it can lead to stressing over too much work and being tired. ten hours can take out a lot of a students day and could interfere with there schedule. student also need free time, with the ten hours they wouldnt have much time because of school work, sports, and jobs. in addition ten hours of school work is just a lot of time, not all student would have that kind of energy to work for ten hours. students have jobs after school and need money. therefore with these ten hours students wouldnt have much time to work because of school work and other activities. jobs are important to students because maybe parents dont give them everything they need for school. some students struggle with just there overall day schedule. ten hours would make it worse, and wouldnt be good for their heath. in conclusion students care about sports and clubs, also sees that as a future career. including that ten hours takes too much time out of your day and that you dont have much free time for yourself, family, and friends. students care about jobs because they need money to help them out with school and other things. ten hours in school just wouldnt be right in a whole day when you can only do so much.

118,2798,DC467256CD82,"Technology, 21st centuries finest product. nearly everyone loves technology, is it really that beautiful? When i was a kid people used to say ""technology will end our social life."" I didnt believe that then, but now i see what they were trying to say. Primarily technologys goal is to make certain tasks easier, not to make us anti-social or make us obese. In my opinion technology has a great potential, and we are not using it to the full potential, we are supposed to use it to make simple task easier, but people are spoiling this potential by instead of making our own food we now order it from a restaurant which is ten times unhealthier. Another thing that is a huge problem is people building their life around technology, if they lose that technology they think theyll die. Everyone uses social apps on their phone, and thats a huge issue because that is one of the main reasons of people choosing social media over having conversations face to face. Secondly, technology has its pros as it has its cons. One of the main advantages of technology is minimizing the waste of time in simple daily life tasks. For example, before technology people used to communicate with mails which took a long time to arrive at the designated place, however currently you can shorten that whole process to only a minute or two. Also with technology we can make waste free houses, cars, planes, and many other things by making them operate with electricity rather than fossil fuels which harms our planet. We can harvest electrical energy by solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric turbines. Another great thing about harvesting electrical energy is that they are infinite unless a disaster happens and suddenly all our water vaporizes or the sun gets blocked or the wind stops blowing. Until disasters like those happens we are good to go with waste free energy. Third of all I think that technology is a great invention for the human kind. Although it has multiple harmful effects for people, the way to cure those are as easy. If we stop building our life around social media or technology, and keep technology as just a secondary communication device. Technology has come a far way from where it started. Once it was used just to power a light bulb, now its used to power our cars, houses, phones, cities, everything you see that is human built has some sort of technology in it. Finally all these great inventions, all of these dazzling things took our attention and isolated us from the others. I think that technology is a brilliant invention but also it is a very harmful one for our social life. Human is a social creature by its nature, if something blocks the socializing part of being human it will end badly. If someone tries to change a creatures nature it will try to avoid it, for thousands of years it has evolved to its current state, and now we are trying to change it... All Im trying to point out is technology is a beneficial element of our life but social-life is not one of them.

119,2413,573E39E45177,"Is distance learning such as, online learning or video conferencing more benefical than traditional learning?. In my opinion, I believe that most students that take online classes have a higher risk of failing. Therefore, they have a higher change of getting distracted. Studies confirmed that young adults are more likely to get distracted than adults since, their minds are not fully develop. I also believe that, every human being has a different way of learning and goes on their own pace. There is positives and negaitives reasons about person-to-person learning and online learning. Person-to-Person learning helps the students gain more knowledge and interaction. While being in a traditional classes, you can ask questions anytime and gain a relationship with one another. The negaitives of tradtional learning is that, students attend to skip class, not listen to the teacher, and sleep during teaching. Students attend to do these negative actions because they might be force to go to school or they can not go on their own pace. Online classes are not benefical but you can go on your own pace. Another reason is that, techonolgy is popular in this generation that students rather be in a device. Online classes have a positive side to them because there is many options online in what you want to learn about, but keep in mind that visual is harder than interacting. Visual is diffcult to understand because there is no instuctor or a teacher helping you in person. I believe that everybody is different and we all learn in different ways and different pace. Some Students would not be able to attend at home classes because of personal problems such as, not having food to feed themselves, some do not have a roof over their heads, or they do not have access to a device. For an example, there are some students at Generic_School that do not have food at their home and all they eat is school lunch. It hurts to see Children that are not able to afford things in life that are in need such as, education. Education is in all of our lifes and I hope traditional schools can still be popular as online schools. In this generation techonology is taking over students!. In conclusion, I support my reasons and my opinions about, traditional learning is a better way to learn than online learning. They both have Pros and Cons but Traditional learning has been in our lives for so many years and techonology and devices are taking over students. Distraction is what young adults have trouble with, Online classes is not a great idea to pursued. There are many reasons and studies, why students should keep attending traditional schools. I also believe everyone works and learns in their own pace and that is why Person-to-person is way to pursued.

I would color what i felt and i would take my anger out its like telling someone what you feel except your drawing it. My secound reason is its not always about drawing you can also the other things with it. You can gather resources and you can build things with that. For example if you had feather and bottles or cans you build a bird out of it. And even just painting something like a wall with difrernt kinds of color thats art. Also it can be soothing because when you have a lot of tress you can paint. Because whe you paint and your trying to paint the beach it relaxing. For meits relaxing because whe you start to paint the brush wont be hard like a pencil it will just go by so soft you wont have to worry about messing up. Its also great becauseyou get to learn about artist. Because it will kinda help you. Because it can tell you about how they draw or paint they can have a special way doing it.

Although, Some people believe that the cell phones shouldnt be allow in classroom.

They think that students that use their cell phone in classroom dont pay attention at what the teacher is teaching them and that could be something that might help them in the future and they think that it is really disrespectful for the teacher that the students use their cell phone during class while he is talking. Also they think that student might use their cell phone to cheat during a test. Cellphone allow students to find any information fast about what they need for the class or group project. A school computer sometimes takes a several moment to log in. Waiting for the computer to log is really stressful because we might not have much in class and many students work after schools so they might not have time to finish it at home. Also help students that are new in this country and that do not know English. They can translate any word they dont know in English. This way students learn more English and faster. The students can use their cell phone to write notes on their cell phone that they can read at any time they want because students are often using their cell phone. students might in their work, in their friends house, walking home or any where else and they just need to take out their cell phone. Also students they can study for a test anywhere they go at any time they want to because they always have their cell phone with them.

School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad. Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they wont be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they wont be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out whats good or bad for them economically. I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she cant get a boyfriend because she doesnt know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me shes having economical problems because shes doesnt know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world. In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world. ",8,7,7,8,8,7,3013,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize students work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all students work not only some students. In conclusion the teachers only need recognize students work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Students with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.",8,6,8,6,7,6,1720,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
130,3097,93385DED39E7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. When i was 15 years old, i broke my leg and that made me incapable of going to the school for 3 months, during those 3 months i didnt get any support to keep track on my classes because the school i was attending didnt had distance learning; Consequently, i almost failed my school year, because of this i support the option of having distance learning. The fact that some schools have the equipment to offer distance learning is motivating, because it gives an opportunity to teenagers that struggle to get the education they need and this can be for several reasons that can limit them to get to their schools such as a medical condition, being isolated from their schools, or any circumstances that can happen during the school year; Furthermore, having distance learning as an option that is beneficial to the students and to the schools in general. Students who are having problems to get to their schools, for factors such as not having money for the transportation or the schools are located too far from them, will benefit of having distance learning. For example, if a student cant get to his school because he cant afford a way to get to their classes on time; Consequently, the student is probably going to fail his school year for not being able to get to his classes, this shows that having distance learning support is beneficial for students that struggle with this type of problems. Students who have for a medical condition, will have problems to get to their schools because of their medical state. For example, a teenager that suffer from osteoporosis is hardly going to be able to get to his educational institution, and this is not going only to affect the student in his education is also going to damage his life by not having that knowledge that he needs to be progress as a person in his life; Furthermore, having support of distance learning to student that cant arrive to schools is an important and necessary characteristic that every schools must have in their options, this demonstrates that having distance learning support can help student that suffer from a disease that makes them unable of being present in school. One of the most important characteristic of having distance learning is that it can be useful in scenarios where the students are in danger of coming to the school for something like a pandemic that would make the schools close, losing a huge a amount of days that will have an impact on the school year; Similarly, to what is happening with the COVID-19 in several countrys around the world that are getting infected by this disease and where they are closing the schools because of this virus, however with the use of temporary distance learning students would be able to keep on track of their studies even when a disease or something similar to this is happening at the moment. On the other hand distance learning can be used in a wrong way, where students simply dont care about their classes, this shows that is not a perfect system that needs to be used only when is necessary to put on practice. In conclusion the use of distance learning in schools is important and useful to the students when they have problems to get to their educational institution and that it also can be used in scenarios where the student wont be able to assist to the school.",9,8,8,9,8,7,1951,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

So it is said Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also its a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but its because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that its better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand . ""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all .

133,3725,8AB55CB5992E,"There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it. One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea. Asking for help and guidance. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now hes now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you. Talking to your priors, family members and communicating. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. Thats how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them. People who dont communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what. Having confidence in yourself. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you wont be nervous to talk in front of a class. One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. this relates to the having confidence because he was scared of talking to people until he starting talking to everybody he saw in the hallways and built his confidence to a new level. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you dont know. Whats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesnt like it either. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because thats a big deal if you dont, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV.

135,990,50419253BA19,"Should take classes like music,a drama,or an art class be required? Although some say that arts class should not be required,actually it should because students can develop talents and also it can help students to lost some stress. In addition, students will find a fun way to be less stress. I am agree with the assertion that student should be required to take an arts class. Those who believe that arts class shouldnt be required they have their reasons. For example they believe that students may not like the class assigned and they also think that it can cause that a student may start cutting his classes. From my perspective I believe that arts class should be required to students because they can develop talents. I believe that because when I was in my country there was one private high school that was located at my city,in that high school all students were required to take an arts class and nevertheless some of them knew how to pain,act,and sing and they were so talented in any arts class that they were taking. Also in my country every year there is a competition that call the most talented students from the country, this competition only awards students that are very talented in arts class such as pain,act,and sing an the students that just to go to the high school that was in my city they frequently just to take first place in those competitions and thats why I believe that that arts class should be required for students it will help develop talents. From my point of view, I think that arts class should be required because it can help students to lose some stress. I believe it because like a student that I am every time when I get off from my Algebra 2 class I am always super stress,but after that class I have the art class. In that class I always lost all my stress when I start drawing things even though I do not how to draw but it help me a lot to keep my main clam. Also why I believe that arts class help students to be less stress is because the environment in the class is always nice,and the students are always focus in the things that they are doing without making to much noise and that is why I believe that arts class should be required to help them to dont be stress the all day in school . To summarize students should be required to take arts class because they can learn to do other things that other people cant do and also it can help them like a way to feel better after coming from other class that was awful.",7,6,6,6,6,7,1051,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
136,2513,E6346D434004,"It is a most important thing to be yourself. At first pass, it would seem to be obvious that you would aspire to be yourself. But we all know of the pressures to please others as we grow up. First the pressure comes from your parents, then your young peers, on to teachers and bosses. You find yourself constantly trying to live up to the expectations of others and why not? It is usually a good things to follow the wishes of those who have raised you, and it is natural to conform to the ways of people who help you along the way. it is alot like osmosis. It is also expected that prescribed pathways are followed, in a way, to repay kindness and debts. As an example, parents pay for your education, including arts and sports activities so surely it makes sense that you would try to excel in those endeavours as a form of Thank you. The same goes for showing a good teacher or mentor that you understand their lesson and often end up developing further on the path they revealed and recommended. However, at some point your own predictions and dreams emerge. Let them and pay attention to them as they will become your guide to your ultimate destiny. While showing respect for your parents and elders, start to forge your own identity. Those who truly love you will be on the sidelines cheering your every step. Consider he words of Dr. Seuss, ""Be who you are and say what you feel because those who mind dont matter and those who matter dont care. I couldnt have said it any better. Essentially, and ultimately, you dont have any choice in the decision about being yourself. Since the time of Socrates, and no doubt before, a predominant human instinct has been to know thyself. The problem for some people however is that they harbour the inner self and keep it separate from the self they display to the world. This predicament can eventually morph into a personality disorder if the gap between your inner person and public persona is too wide. Soon being in public will become a chore you will feel like a phony. you will probably end up living the life of the recluse. Not a good result for most people except the odd monk. The best way to allow your inner self, that part of you that holds your real aspirations and dreams, to become what the world sees is to start cultivating the key aspects of those chracter traits. Start becoming that person in your mind and begin to feel this is yourtrue self soon actions will follow. You will begin to feel comfortable in your own skin. For example, if you want to become a musician then slowly tell people that you ""are planning a career in music"" and start acting that way. Surprisingly, this will start you help you as other people will begin to look at you in that light. Eventually they will tell others who are interested in the same path. Soon that will led to communications between you and a host of other like-minded people. Your network will expand and you will soon be part of a musically inclined community nurtured and growing professionally all the while gaining confidence in the new you. Another way to look at finding yourself involves a more prosctive, less reflective path. Life is not about finding yourself ; Life is about creating yourself"". This is the other side of the coin. Maybe our ""selves"" are like a blank slate waiting for someone to write the future. Maybe we should not dwell too much on ourselves. Too much soul searching can lead to a sort of paralysis an inertia brought on by excessive searching for the meaning. I think we all instinctively know what we want to do it is just some of us are a little hesitant to breakout. But, it is the only way you will reduce anxiety and eventually find a sense of fulfillment. So just do it as the Nike ads encourage. Step into that real you and have some fun along the way. Be Yourself. Everyone else is taken. So, we need to keep this things into our selves that way we could improve our selves as the best human being in the world. No one can make you feel inferior without your consent. So, I totally agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson that ""To be yourself in a world is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.",7,7,8,7,7,7,3325,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
137,3214,40467A05CC2A,"Career is the most important in people life. if people do not have a career, then will become a unemployed vagrant. People do not have work, so they do not have money. As the saying goes,if you do not have money then you can not do anything. therefore career is most important. At a young age,students thought is more brisk. student will thing about the career that they will do in the future. At that time people have a illusion,visualize a bright future, have a expect on the career in the future. At this time, if the teacher gave student guide to selected towards a specific carreer. students will fiem and unshakable their thought. they will do the best one can to achieve the goals. Student will bring pressure on thierself. if do not have pressure,then do not have improve. In the high school, should provide the courses of select to guide them towards a specific career. For the reason: first ,by do this can develop good habits on the student, in the school. Second, student not only can study hard but also can get skills. Third students will be good at their class that they choose to be a career. In the school,develop the courses of specific career has more advantage. For example,student graduate on the university, they are not face with on the obtain employment. I think it is a good idea for student to gain the skill for the career. On the another way, develop the career courses early, it will give student more pressure, because in this time student are still immature. if gave they more pressure,can not make students students but can make students fell repugnant. This way just run counter to students intentions. Not all students need pressure to improve thierself. But some students do not need pressure.

138,2912,F57B95D17755,No not good for older and younger students to be in a program. But sometimes older kids become mean and dont care about the younger just care themself to have fun. Its not normal for that to happen and it will feel weird harder stuff for the younger ones dont know and the older kids think its too easy. Theres so much reasons that it shouldnt happen doesnnt feel right. If it was like in the summer for an activity that would be great because you learn about how the older and younger kids are. The younger kids will want to do childess stuff and the older ones want to just be on there phones and just talk. Sometimes the older ones need to teach the younger ones to be more grown up so they learn about the older ones. The teachers mostly will try to tell the older ones to help the younger ones to be grown up. So usually they shouldnt create schools like that it will feel completly different because there will be different stuff then real schools with older and older kids and younger and younger kids. The younger ones could sometimes scream and run or goof around a lot and the older ones sometimes will feel annoyed by them. So lots times I feel like the older ones will feel unconfortable from the little ones. When you grow older you learn what you do now and not like when you were younger. Most the time you usually want to be friends with people your age not too much of a different age. Sometimes it can happen to be friends with someone older or younger but most times your age. Always try to be yourself and not change your additude. Sometimes the older kids will need to try make the little kids happy by talking with them and have fun with them. But not for to long you should because it will get boring doing it for a long time. When u finshis they will sometimes try bothering you because they liked what you did but just leave them alone after. These are examples why sometimes you should or shouldnt allow those schools with older and younger students. After when you grow older you the one teaching the new kids to be grown up. Try remeber the times you were little and what the older kids did to you do that with others. But there could be lots of times younger ones a different and you were that way 8 years ago.

First, working with a group make things more easy for students because they will all work together in each part of the assignment, one student can do the research while the other one write the information the other student can be looking for graphs or other information that they might need, students also get to have fun by working with a group because they can talk to each others and also laugh from their mistakes . In addition, students have the opportunity to learn no just the topic of the assignment but also learn from each other, working with a group gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and toughts it also help us to see the differfents points of view,by working with a group we also get help from each others because if one student does not know the answer to a questions the other students might have the right answer. Last, for some students working with a group makes them feel more comfortable because they can help each other and support the different positions and ideas, by working all together they will have better result and they will learn more by having discussions and sharings their different opinions. In conclusion working with a group have more benefits because the students learn more and have better results, they learn more from each other, they discuss the different points of view and they also learn to respect and listen to the different positions that they have.

140,1471,63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things. Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day. If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday. Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage. Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow. The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",5,6,8,7,6,6,1297,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Sometimes it is not the best idea to mirror other peoples behavior because some people do not always have a positive behavior.

Growing up in the Generic_City area, I have been able to witness a lot of drugs, gangs, and violence.

Out of my three years of high school I was able to see some students making their way for others by not being selfish; a lot of them did volunteer work as well to help the community and to hopefully inspire others to do so as well. I actually got the opportunity to throw a kids halloween party at a church: I enjoyed it, it was a lot of fun. Honestly, I do not feel like I am a good example nor do I feel like I am a bad one either. I make mistakes: it is how I was taught. Growing up I believed that the only way you are ever going to learn is by making mistakes and being able to evaluate the error of your mistake; only then you can truly improve yourself and help insipre other people as well. In conclusion, I am mutual about examples being the best way to influence other people because of it not always being a positive thing due to the poor decisions some people choose to make. Truthfully I think it is a better idea to be the best you that you can be because at the end of the day there is only one of you and so many of us; it is best to stay unique.",9,9,9,9,9,9,1060,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

144,1820,5241864FBC48,"My Grandma always use to say that ""working with a group is fun and all, but at the end of the day, I would have to understand what the group activity was about, but at the same time working with a group can get more work done and we help each other."" She explained to me that there isnt group work when it comes down to taking a test or quiz. Students are always sitting down and learning maybe getting up and working with a couple of classmates can help learn too. Im the one in a seat answering the questions on a test or quiz. There is no group work involved when it comes down to that. I think working alone and working as a group can both be beneficial. First when working in a group I can understand my classmates more than my teacher. I can understand more especially if a student just like me explains everything. I might not understand somethings or tend to forget, however someone in my group could know or refresh my memory by giving me notes, or vise versa. I can get a ton of work done as a group, but do I really understand what I just did. For example, say we have a group of five students, three of them are constantly talking, the other two students are the only ones in the group that are actually doing the work. The grade that the group received was a 95. If the students are quizzed on what they have just completed, the students that were talkative are most likely to get a lower grade than the two students that were actually doing the activity without getting off topic. Second when working alone there are no distractions. I would get my work done peacefully, at a rate I would like to go. I would not get as much work done as if I was in a group, but the teacher would know that its all my work. For example, say Im working with a group, we get a 93 for the whole group work. I received a quiz on what we just did and I got a 78. After that performance, the teacher gave me notes and went over the same material with me. I studied; and I took the quiz again. This time I got a 90. Therefor, this goes to show that working alone helps the teacher figure out what you need help on. Some people say that working in a group can cause fights,distractions, and poor quality work ethic. I feel like working alone is more beneficial. Everything can not be done in a group. Sometimes you have to work alone to fully grasp the subject. Working alone lets your brain process better especially at its own rate. The teacher can really see what you need help on. In conclusion, I think that both working in a group and working alone are beneficial. I think that working alone is more beneficial because everyone works and really understands the subject at a different pace. Working in a group does not show the teacher a specific persons work. Thats why I think working alone can better help yourself and is more beneficial. ",8,8,8,9,9,9,1074,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

146,3023,B9B71CEE162B,"This is a very important important subject to me Thank You fore giving me the opportunity write about it. In my opinion i believe that graduating in four years is a lot better than, graduating in three years. The traditional four years of high school does not put the student under pressure, unlike the three year plan. The four year plan allows the student to have some elective classes. The three year plan helps students graduate faster but it also, it does not give people time to enjoy the summer or have free time to do their favorite hobby. High school is the best time of every students life, because in high school students do not have a lot of responsibilities. Students who decide to pick the three year plan will be making a big mistake. Students might not be able to have any elective classes, these classes are made to be easy classes that help student do their favorite hobby like playing guitar, piano and sports, these type of classes help students remove the stress from their brains by doing something they like. I am pretty sure that students who do the four year traditional plan will be doing better in school because they are not pressured, unlike the other students with the three year plan. I was born in Egypt i moved to the United States in 2015, which was my freshman year of high school. I had to take all the mandatory classes in my first year in order to be able to graduate on time. I was not able to take any elective classes, which put me under pressure and made feel bad, because of the amount of homework and the number of hours i used to sit in my room and study. Students in high school should be enjoying their lives. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to enjoy their lives with their family all year long, because they will have to study in order to pass their class and graduate. We all know that social life is important to every single one of us and, it affects how we do in school. Students who do the three year plan do not have time to do anything but study and do school related stuff which causes a lot of people depression and anxiety. Last year one of my closest friends had to do summer school, every time i call him he barley answers and says that he can not hang out because he got school related work to do. My friend used to hangout with me all the time but he did not because he had to go to summer school, he was telling me that he was not happy be cause he would wake up go to school finish school, go straight to work, come back from work do his homework and sleep, he barley had time to eat, which made him very tired mentally and physically. Some of the students in high school are independent, they live on their own have a job and dont ask parents for money. Independent students can not do the three year plan because the will not have any time to do anything other than work and school. For example i have a job i live on my own and i do not as my parents for any money or anything in order for me to do the three year plan i will have to quit my job, so i can be able to focus on school or else i will fail in school and not be able to graduate and if quit my job i will have no source of income to take care of myself and pay for my rent, but i do the four year traditional plan and i have a good job where i can focus on both school and my job so i can live. In conclusion the three year plan is not a very good decision to make and everyone should think twice before deciding on it. The three year plan does not let students have their free time to hand out with their friends or do their favorite hobby. That plan also does not give people time to have time with their family or the people they love. The three year plan will not give you time to have a job if you need one. I believe by going to high school for four years students will be able to get more experience and enjoy the best time of their lives.

149,854,7A68E1FB7863,"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary. To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager. In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they dont want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didnt expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students. As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher dont give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.

150,925,D7B9BEAEE50E,"Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that its a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us. The first reason is because the parents of the students wont have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food. My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain wont function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day. My last reason, is that the student wont be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier. This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.

Elementary students should need to know what will go on in middle school and its expectations. So explaining it will make it easier for sixth grade students. once coming to middle school First of all, students should know about the class room expectations. Middle school student should be respectful, responsible, and productive. Kids should know better than to play around ,or ignore teachers and ignore their work. Students should come to school ready to learn not to play around. Kids should be quiet while a teacher is talking and should also be silent while taking a test or quiz. They shouldnt be throwing stuff around the room or be yelling or screaming. When i used to talk i would get in trouble but, i would always listen to the teacher. Second of all, students should know about halls and lockers expectations. While walking in the halls kids should be safe. Students should not run in the halls and, should not push and shove other kids. Because students could get injured. At your lockers you should get your things for the next class and not talk to your friends in the hallways. If you cant open you locker ask a teacher near by. But you shouldnt kick your locker. If i couldnt get my locker open i would just ask a teacher to help me. Dont kick or slam you locker respect the schools things because it provides you with the things you need to learn with. Last but not least, you must know the lunch expectations. During in line to get your lunch you shouldnt be touching everything nor, keep a hold up in the line. Be productive and get your lunch fast then take a seat at you table. If you need anything raise your hand dont get up with out permission. Dont throw food at people pick up your trash once you leave and, dont make a mess. While eating you should stay in you own seat and not at others tables. Once i would go to lunch i would get my food fast then take a seat with my friends at my table. In the cafeteria it is super loud so try not to scream or yell because it will be extra louder if you do.

School will use the same amount of energy, because they will be using a energy for two more hours each day which is equivalent if they reduced the five-week day to four-week day. The same amount of energy will be used in both ways. Make a new change will afect not only at school it will also afect society. Everyone is adapted to the sistem as it is now if thre is any change there will be needed new rules for example what students will be doing two more hours in school or what we are suppose to do with an extra free day during the week. If students have an extra day doring the week will not be beneficiary, because they can use these time to play video games or spend their time doing things that are not good for them. If school approved the new model they will need to raise the works wages for the two more hours of work in each day which will count as over time, because the legal hours per day for a person should work is just eight hours. In fact they will be paying more money compare to the money they are paying now. Now they are just are not paying over time. The eschool should not be adopted this new model, because they will be using more resources. In my opinion school definite should not adopted the new model, because there are more disadvatanges than benefits. If any other school have not done before is because it is not good for students. The new chage is not neceessity for our school. The same energy will be used and there will be more resources used. For some businesses might work but it wil not work for our school. I hope my school do not decided to make this new change. ",6,5,7,6,6,5,2525,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Doing small act of kindness can really help people by if they lost money and you found it and you gave it back that helps them or you clean their car for them that could mean a lot to the person. picking up trash can help the earth that why no matter how small act of kindness it is it can still have a big impact on someone day. I think more people should start being kind to other. tell me this when someone is kind to you. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you thats kindness they were kind to come and help you. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it.

161,2547,45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent. In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just dont want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they dont want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they dont want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything. Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy. Some people argue that in this life you dont need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you dont need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible. In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",6,5,5,6,4,5,908,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
162,3785,0A324290AFE7,"I disagree with his statement, because if your good at something you can always put more effort in to it , and you can also be better at what you are good at, and last you can never stop growing of what you mastered . people in general they always get better of what they already mastered . First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, im good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve. Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking. You can be better then someone ; become better than that person that you want to challenge, or you can challenge yourself. Challenge yourself is a good way to grow. Perfect takes practice; be good of right now, but become better in the future. Taking your time and taking it slow, you can 100% be better. Trust me its not easy to be better that you have already mastered, but theres always way and a chance. The important thing you need to know is you cant not stop growing; you can always keep on growing even though you are already good at it. Only because you are already good at something doesnt mean you stop growing, you can keep growing, if you try a little harder. I will always try my hardest to be the best at it; no matter how hard it is. There is always a way to keep on growing. If you show others that you can be way better even though you already good so far, they will see that there is a way to keep on growing. Show an example to others; let other people know that it is possible to be better, at something you are good at. Prove to those people that thinks you cant keep on growing of what you already mastered. You will not grow, if you dont put more effort in it, and time. If you just stop of what your good at, then you will not grow. Remember you can always grow of what you mastered. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant. practice comes perfect. Do all the things you need to do to be better, then you will grow more then you expect.

164,3101,462769ABDD5B,My opinion about performing a community service is that they should have a community service. i think that they should have that because the a community service gives a help to the community because helping out in the community is very good and could give a good help to residents in the community because some communities have old people or even paralised person which cant help out in the community. So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community. I think those students who say community service takes too much time they should just give some time when they are just sitting their in the couch and go help out your community and the environment.,7,5,7,6,5,6,913,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

166,3639,78E8970D0C13,"I argree with haveing a afterschool homework club, because It well help out alot of students improve in school, and do better overall. also dont you want extral help when you need it? students are the same they want help on schoolwork and homework cause it could be difficult. students dont really like difficult homework, so they give up and do something else, but with a homework club they can go afterschool and do the work there teachers can help students out. for example I sometimes need help, so I have a teacher that helps me at home with my work and my parntents has to pay that teacher. and some parntants dont have the money to pay for a teacher, so if we can work togather to make a club that helps out students that would be great for the students, and the parntents would not have to pay alot of money to make they child good at school. a other example would be that students can stay afterschool with there teachers, but for a little bit of time, so if were going to have a homework club lets make it more than 47 minumies. More time equlas a lot of work getting compled. in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers dont feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest. overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.

At first I joined chorus in 1st grade and finished in 5th grade. I really enjoyed it ,so I chose to learn an instrument, which ended with me joining band. In band, I learned how to play the recorder. I played it from 2nd grade to 3rd grade. After learning the recorder I switch instruments to a xylophone, that played during 4th grade. Since I didnt really like playing the xylophone, I chose to do percussion for 5th grade. I was also learning the guitar during 4th grade through 5th. when I entered middle school I decided to turn things around by choosing to do orchestra. I learned everything I had to know in 6th grade ,so I was ready to play the violin in 7th grade.

I has a day where I saw a homeless man at a store and I had to give him $5 dollars because he was a nice man, plus he gave me respect. After that day I went to the store to see if he was still there, since he was so generous . When I was him I was shocked that what was he wearing.

170,971,7F0703CF058E,"Many people success because of their behavior or attitude and how well they do in school or how great they are with other. But having a positive attitude is good because, If you are a positive person other people would like to be around you more, You will feel better and in a good mood most of the time, You could help others do well in work or even if they feel down or without motivation. It also helps in your daily day. A good attitude is great for everyone and it shows the real you. Having a positive attitude is good for you and others. Many people are depressed and being around someone with a positive attitude makes them feel better and more confident. An example of this is if your friend is going through a hard time and you help him or her or even talk to them positively about the issues they will feel better and even could possibly start getting a better attitude. Just because they getting the support or talk they need by a close friends with a good attitude. So people even feel so much better about them self whenever they talk to someone about their problems. And Having a good attitude is like having a good vibe and people love being around those type of people. You will feel better with yourself if you are in a good mood. Being positive helps with your mood and they way you see life. If your having a hard time at work or any other ativities such as school, sports or even at home.

A positive attitude helps a lot on your daily basic. Lets said you and you wife or husband argue. All you would need to do is think positive like about good memories or moments together. Im pretty sure if yall love each other the argument wont really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude. However, A lot of people would believe that not having a positive attitude is the key to success, They are wrong because a lot of things could happen when you are a negative person. Such as being depressed, losing motivation to do almost anything, making bad decisions, not like being with others, and not liking things you use to do. All this reason could be because of a bad attitude. But soever if you have a positive mood everything would feel so much better and you gonna have better days and other would respect you because of your attitude. In conclusion having a positive attitude is good for everyone and it makes people life better. Because of the good moods, helping others and yourself, having better days. And it just makes life so much better and easier. No one deserve to be negative or even mean to others. We all created equal and we all live in the same world.

171,3109,DC5DAF538DF2,"During the World War II, most of the people were influenced by the behavior of the people. For instance, a lot of people choose to follow the anti-Semitic politics of Hitler and the Nazis because they were afraid of the death because the Nazis convinced them to follow them. Indeed, by setting a good example you success to convince them because you use both of the major things to influence, the feelings and the acts. You try to reach his heart by the sensitivity and by the concrete you show him that it is easy to do it. In this way, when you are setting a good example you are using the feelings of the people in order to show them the better behavior to adopt. The fear, the happiness, the solemnity can influence a choice of a person and that is why it is the better way to persuade. Through the fashion, the advertisements, the politics the sensitivity is always utilized to change the mind of someone. The behavior is the only thing that can help someone to change their opinion because trough it you can transmit all of your feelings to your speaker. Furthermore, people can be persuade by acts more easily than by words. So, by setting a good example, you can also influence people by showing them the better way to do something. Although people disagree with philosopher, physician, and humanitarian like Albert Schweitzer and affirm that there are better ways to convince someone, people should consider that to set a good example is the better way to persuade somebody. Firstly, the behavior is using the feelings to convince people. Indeed, whatever things you do to influence someone you use their feelings. And this is the best way because the feelings are something that stay in your mind and touch you directly and can let you do things even bad. The first example is in politics. A politician who takes a solemn tone and does a serious, and sad speech will influence your opinion and by modifying your state of mind he will transmit these feelings to show you what he wants you to think. Martin Luther King said: ""I have a dream"" so immediately you know that this dream is something anchored in his heart and he will give you all of his arguments to persuade you. Then, the second example is advertisement. As well as the fashion than the TV shows, each publicity lets you feel so be it fear, so be it happiness. They carry away people with them in their opinion and by choosing beautiful musics or pictures they help the spectator to feel the good vibes that the actors or advertising want to give you. Secondly, by setting a good example you can convince people to do acts. The first reason is people of our generations need to see to trust someone. And this is the reason why you need to show the example to someone to help him to trust you and give him the directions to follow. It was always easier to speak instead of to act but people want to see to know this is the better choice. For example, when you are doing shopping most of the girls prefer doing it in the shop instead of in line because women want to see their clothes to try them and be convinced this dress or this shirt is the better. The other reason is that you always want to have a concrete thing. So when you show the example you demonstrate that what you do is possible and affordable to you all and you encourage them to do it with you and this is what influence others. You give a proof of concrete and the speaker only need a little bit of will. For example during an humanitarian mission, if you are the leader of this one you need to show them the example not only with your behavior but also in what you must accomplish. If you are here to rebuild a public building you will do it with the volunteers to help them and lead the group. To conclude, the example is the best way to influence people for two reasons. The first one is obviously the aspect of the feelings. The transmission of a posture or opinion can help you to do a choice. The second one is the aspect of the concrete part. You give the example of what to do and the others can do it easily. Finally, there is not better way to convince people as Albert Schweitzer said. Because there is only one way which combines feelings and action and it is the good example by your own behavior.

173,2277,DF328FBE5029,"The British naturalist and John Lubbock wrote. Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.Do we choose our own character traits ,or is our character formed by influences beyond our control. Although some people think that character is formed for other persons that are around them and that their character is always going to be formed for people around them but character is formed by the way of your own emotions that shows how you feel how you are, other people says that if they dont be like other people want to they be they feel out of the group in that moment some people starts to hate their self, but what other people do is they ignore what people says about them as they dont hear anything and never give up. Other people think that if they dont change their character they are going to success in their life and that they are obligate to change for they future and when they change they start to feel bad because they change something better than what they get and when other people ask them for what they change they says that for be an adult they have to be like one but what is a adult is a is a person that looks death and is always mad with other people or they say that the character is formed from the moment they born and that hey can not do anything about it . In my conclusion, We choose our own character and its doesnt have nothing with others person ,we choose how we wanna be and how we feel better with our self...

174,1457,F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldnt offer differing alternatives,because technology wasnt as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,theyll be able to benefit because they wont feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wontt have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they wont have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,theres a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because hes always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldnt have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people dont tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,its an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, whove unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasnt for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldnt have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldnt really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we couldve ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning.

Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student? The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosent feel like doing it.

186,1871,F1B4412674FE,"My thoughts on what author Ralph Waldo had wrote, is something I can agree with. The things i have experience and has made me the person Iam today, has taught me that doing the same things will not help me learn and grow. Being fearless and taking a risk on something, will change me and anyone else to a more powerful and successful person. When I was young, my parents had gotten me a bike with training wheels, I had started to ride it and it was pretty difficult to ride. Every day when I came home from school, I would go outside and ride my bike. I started to get better and better, I wasnt struggling anymore. My parent had saw that I have gotten the hang of it and told me that I should try and do it with out the training wheels. I was to afraid and nervous that I wouldnt be able to ride the bike with training wheels so I didnt let him take them off. He told me that if dont take the wheels off, how will I grow and take risks in life when im older and have big things that id have to develop and learn what I made a mistake on not doing and learn from my mistake. So i started to think to myself, ""If i didnt take them off how will I know that im good or horrible"". I told my dad to take them off, once he took them off i was pretty scared but then i started to get better and better that i wasnt afraid. I was pretty proud of myself and gave me courage. Once youve done something in your life that was huge and still did the same thing over and over what would you grow from it. You are in this world to learn and grow. To become a stronger, and successful person to accomplish something big and grow from where they have started. If someone was to started off as a employee at McDonald and was thinking of being a manager somewhere and have his own company how could he do that if hes just a worker at McDonald. If he wanted to be a manager and own his own company, he would have to be the hardest worker there and show that he can handle and work and follow all the rules. He ends up getting a raise and is the employee of the month for showing that hes a hard worker. the manger realizes that hes got a big future ahead of him. Years later, hes a manager at his own company and is being successful in life hes learned that not giving up and risking things to become what he is now is incredible. Last but not least, if someone is not challenging them self, how would they know that they are good at it and could be able to do so much. Ralph Waldo has gave people the courage and make them think that they can do anything to become someone youd never thought you could be. If you believe you can do anything then you are growing and realizing that all you need to do is to be fearless and take risks. Thats the point of growing. I have learned so much and ready to learn more and to become successful in my life. The statement Ralph Waldo had wrote is something i agree with and will grow to be successful.",6,7,8,7,6,7,3578,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Now in days their are people that expect if they try on doing something once they can not succeed again. Humans relay on others for their own achievement.

In my opinion, the technology had negative effects on peoples lives, because the technology had been corrupt the mind, also expose the life of people. in the actuality the people act like robots. Most of the time, they do not think by them self. In addition the interaction between family and friends is been losing a cause of social media or videos games. However many people think the opposite, they think live before without technology the people was illiterate, and they think the technology is a progress for the world. The technology brought a lot of invents like explore the human body, talk with the people that is not near from us, or maintain informed what happens in another place, Even still the technology is giving us a lot of sources like buy things without leave the house, but the technology is had been negative effects on peoples live because nowadays many people, most kids and teenagers they do not think by them self. One of many example of that is when you ask a girl or a boy about something really important how it is, if the water has energy? Most of the teenagers is going to answer yes, and I know this because in my science class the teacher asked this question, and everyone in the classroom answers yes, but the teacher said the water does not have energy, and she explains why, but no one has convince and what she told, so they look in Google and they arrived the conclusion what the teacher say was correct. The point with this example is to see nowadays the people believe more and what Google or other things what form part of the technology say. if the people need a solution to solve any problem, they actually do not think about it. they go to the internet and look for solution. another negative effect of the technology in the daily life is the interaction. I am going to expose my family and friends. when i spend time with my family and friend, they always happens in their cellphones, they do not pay attention around of their behavior. They lose the notion of their time and everything a cause of the social media even my brother he does not want to go out and play soccer or to walk, because he is more interesting to play videos games or watch videos. In actuality a cellphone is indispensable to live. to do moments that suppose there are good moments, or that is the people believe, but they forget the feeling to talk, to joke without check their cellphone every two minutes. We slowly losing our feelings, our taste for life, our friends, our family, and even our jobs. In addition the technology expose our private life. Example is for every transition you do, you need to give your personal information. The social media is turn in our worst enemy because across of the internet many people has been bullied for the videos or picture that they shared until to lead the people to suicide. in conclusion the technology is our worst tool to improve ourself. The time of Elbert Einsteins was afraid is coming soon. The technology is opaquing our intellect. The technology is turn into robots without the capacity to think by ourself. thanks to the technology the humanity is turn in unselfish, unsuccessful, and unsure of themself. The effects of the technology cause ours children, teenagers are negative and we only watch how the future of the world is going down.

189,816,1451EA314B8A,"Students in the classroom always debate about working alone, or in groups, both of the ways of work have beneficial and non beneficial aspects,In fact; some students do not like to work in groups, they may say things like people in their groups do not do anything ,and they would rather to work by themselves, but in my personal opinion working in groups is a better idea. When students work in groups they can divide the assignment in different pieces, in that way it can be easier for each person in the group, another aspect to think about is that students in the group can help out each other. Working in groups will also be less stressful for each person in the group. First, when students work in groups they could perfectly divide the assignment in small portions. for instance, if they have a project about global warming, they could tell each person to find something different, one person can find the characteristics of global warming, a different person the reasons why it happens, and someone else some examples of the topic. Second, students always need help ,and they could help each other in the group. Help out each others in the group is a good way to develop team work, it may help them when they go to college, or after when they grow up and have jobs. Furthermore, teach students about team work is a really beneficial aspect to think about because students are the future of this society, and teach them how to work with others is going to help them to develop an open-mind. Another important thing is that they would have less stress, if they work as a team and divide the work, they will feel less stress, also they are going to find more time to work in different assignments from different classes. In addition, if they have more time for others classes their grades may increase, and they will have a better academic performance. To summarize, working in groups have a lot of beneficial aspects, students may grow as a person and develop different values when they work as a team, also they will learn more as individuals something that the new generation needs, students will also accomplish new things and be more successful.

It is important to fall down and dont loose our hope because that hope and the enthusiasm make us better persons and that is our impulse to succeed and make our dreams real. We need to think like a winners no matter what is going wrong in our life, take our weakness and make it strengths.

191,2796,4665A1D77D6C,"In this passage i will tell you my point of view of this, I believe that it dosent matter how much experience someone has over the other person, it only increases there chances of getting picked, and only by a small margin. my reason is that people shouldnt pick a person by what or how much experience they have, but pick the people that are best for the job such as being a hard worker, fast learner, or by being determined to work. you might not have the experience but they can still pick you for the job, all you have to do is to prove to them that you can do learn it and will be able to do after it. I think getting a new job is like learning a new unit in a class all you need is a person to show you how they do it and improve on that and, you will have setbacks or things that you wont understand. but you will still have the teacher or the person that is helping you, that can tell you if your doing something wrong or to answer your questions. once you had enough practice with it, you can help other people that have the same problems as you or the same questions. by getting the job youve learned how to do those things and how to teach other people how to do it too. you dont need experience you need people with experience to teach you so you can teach other people. In my experience to have a good worker they dont need to have experience, they only need people to teach them while there working seeing what they are doing wrong and improving on that. while i was working in a construction job, i was making mistakes all over the place, i wasnt doing well with tools or machines, sometimes i would cut the materials too small or too large, so most of the time i would hand it over to one of my coworkers and with the tools, most of the time would get them mixed up, for example one coworker will ask for a tool and my mind would just be blank then they would just get it themselves, so after i had to practice with the tools and by the end of the time i was working there i never got one thing wrong, this proves that all you need is practice during the job or work, it dosent matter if you have never done it before all you need to practice. Although i do acknowledge the people with experience have more of a chance to get the job there going for but all im saying is that you shouldnt doubt yourself when someone has experience and you dont, just keep your eyes open and your head strong and see if you got the job, and if you didnt, try another time, it dosent matter if you fail to get the job once or multiple times, it dosent matter if someone has more experience then you, if you prove to them that you can work harder then them, and learn more then them they will pick you for the job. all you need to do is go to the interview and show what you can do and what sort of person you are. In this passage i have show that you dont need to have the experience to get the job or being a good worker, you just need to be determined to do the work and they will recognize that, and they will respect you more. but only if you do good work you cant expect good things to happen because of bad results, but if you prove to them that you will be able to learn how to do it then you will get the job. i have also shown my own experience with it of being a worker that had no experience to being the one that never messed up at the end.

Students wouldnt have to get up so early in the morning having to look presentable or anything just having to have a good schealue that works good for both work and school.

How nice people are to them . First, Being stuck in the house isnt fun because you wont meet new people or reconnect with people from your old school or meet the love of your life .Things like this is what makes people kill their self because they dont have fun.

Try something new that you never done before its something scary for humans it doesnt matter the age or how brave you are, if you had a lot difficulties doing it; probably you will be scare if you have to do it again even if you already know how to do it for example, I been working in a Japanese restaurant about one year and half and it was the first time for me working as a server and I was scare to do it and the reason why I decide to do it was the money, and I got surprise of myself because I made it and my boss was telling me that I was doing really good job and I felt so proud of my self because at that time my English want perfect and after Im got problems with him about money and it was too much problems, so I decide get another job my friend told me that her boss was looking for new servers so I went to apply but the problem was when I saw the size of the restaurant and the different with the other restaurant was a lot and also when I saw the menu in mind I was saying "" You will fail"" I feel too bad that day, and all the progress was long and suffering for all the mistakes that I made but I made it one more time and today I thinking all that I went through it wast that much difficult and Im not a master but Im still learning. Many people are conformist with their life and dont want to learn more and unfortunelly Im include in that group of people and it happens to me that I fail many times because I think already know everything even more than others for example, One day I was taking a Spanish test and felt confident about it because my first language is Spanish and I remember the majority of my classmates were studying for that test but wasnt and I fail the test because I saw questions that I never imagine that even exist and that was very important to get a credit so that day I learn that even if know many things is always good learn more. In conclusion, you have to be better every day and know that is always more to learn every day, even if you know the stuff and always keep in your mind that try something new dont have to scare you because every human has the ability to learn and do the much that they want and the only obstacle you put it to your self.

My reason is if we try to done good stuff for people, and not receiving anything back for example: If I give people chance to not try anything, then how are we gonna communicate? how are we going to accomplish our goal when you dont deserve it? so my point and my reason is the we need to do something about not being inactivity with people are around you.

The older and younger student have different experience with their childhood and their elementary, which they can help with each other and the program for the older and younger student will help them improve their skills and their grades.

200,882,E6338A929654,"Having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self. Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them. Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like. In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. The persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life. ",9,8,8,8,7,7,3324,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
201,2118,CA966FF7F1E6,"The results of talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choices can be absolutely helpful. People will be able to develop new ideas with the help of more than one person. They will be able too learn things way more faster. How ever you have to ask the right person for help. Some people are not able to help others, because they dont the right mind set as others. Last reason why talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better is helpful because people need someone too talk too and get ideas from. If someone is sad or they need help with problems that happen in their life. They need too find someone that can help them and seek for multiple opinions. For instance i think that if you develop new ideas from the help of more than one person can be helpful in so many ways. One way is if you talk to the right person you will actually be able too get a good job in the future. Second reason why talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choices and it will develop new ideas is because people will be able to get new opinions and for information to help them with their career. How ever theres many reasons why you can be able to develop new ideas. If you wanna talk to someone about seeking for multiple opinions and making better choices. You need to find the right person. There are people that can lie about so many things. People like this can ruin so many careers and dreams from people. They do not have the right mind sets of others. Thats why you should find the right people too seek new opinion from. There are so many people that need help and need ideas, because they are going through tough times in their lives. This is why i think its better for everyone to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions. They are able too talk too you and they will be able too make you feel better. Those people are able too make your day. If you have found the right people too talk to than they will easily solve your problems. They will also give you great opinions too seek. In conclusion people say that talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choices is a bad thing. I disagree with their opinion. People need more than one person to seek new opinions. They also need others to make better choices. How ever the results of talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choice is a good thing.

202,2097,5EE526AB840B,"How can a students learn more from home than attend classes in school?. A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future. Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said ""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friends name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing. Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her. Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life. In conclusion, the offer to learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing in not a good idea because all of them are under 18, They does not have a good criteria to take that big decision that can bring serious consequences or affect their life.",8,6,7,6,6,6,1222,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
203,3340,108CA77CBAB4,"although former British minister Winston Churchill says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" actually to get to success sometimes does take failure to get it. actually this is very true for people who never give and work hard even after they fail time and time and again. for example when you fail at something to keep trying after till you succeed. some people think if you fail you wont be successful that is not true. if you never give up you will be successful. another example when you fall you always get back up and keep going and pushing forward. only you can decide if you want to always fail or try harder. to get success it aint easy. there is a saying nothing that is easy to get is wroth having. this relates to what Churchill said. Winston Churchill is a wise man and i would agree with him. everything he said about failing and being successful after is true. they are so many successful people who have failed plenty of times in their life. it happens to all people no can be perfect at what they want or do in their life. inconclousion Winston Churchill is a wise man for his saying. his saying can motivate many people who feel like giving up after failing.

204,3535,15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience. Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well. On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have. To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us. Life could be bored if you are stack doing what you already know and not trying something else.",8,6,7,7,6,7,294,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Simple, not everybody has the same capacity, as somebody said ""we can not judge a fish by his ability to claim a tree"", we must motive the student to take the class that he/she wants and they will give their best. thanks for the attention, in addition, I hope that the principal could take a smart choice and leave the classes electives.",6,5,7,7,7,6,3260,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
206,3171,CD1D7EC5810C,"It has been asked by one teacher about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Work is the ability to do something that given by any one it can be a person, a company or at school that we do it by ourselves or with group. One scientist said that, ""one country can developed not by the Prime minister(President) its by working together"". Although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work. Some people says that working alone is more beneficial than working in group because they learn how to accomplish things by themselves. In our world almost all people struggle to accomplish their work by their own, which is good to learn many challenging things in our work. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with out asking for help, he also fail many times to passing light through in the bulb. Also Leonardo Davinci took him more than a year to draw the most expensive and beautiful woman Monaliza, but he didnt ask anyone to help him. We can do any thing by ourselves if we work hard and struggle not to fail. Actually Working with group is more beneficial than working alone because more ideas flow out from another person. In Biology our nerve system can stuck when we thing over and get stressed, the last level of stress is stuck. One person can do one or two things but if another person help him they can have more ideas. For instance, the two brothers who made the airplane, now a days we can see what kind of airplane made. However because of they are two they mix their idea and get it done. Time is short in this world. God gave as the time interval to do in our inter life. Bible says God gave 900 years for Adam, and when the people become a lot the time interval became more less, and now a days the interval for our age(time) is 80 or 90 in average. When I came to my idea, it is limited by shorten time to complete the work when we working with group. Lets give an example for this; the teacher gave an assignment for each student to do research about global warming, he gave 1 month to submit it, but if they had work in a group they can easily do it with in less than a month. In this world we stay for shorten time interval we can work together to accomplish our goal. although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work.

207,1628,EA40087521CC,"Failure is a dreaded thing in our daily life what we try to avoid. A lot of people trying to not get in any situation where they can fail, and just a lesser layer of the people want to face with them. Those people find it as a learning process and they a make great outcomes from they life. Fear controlls every aspect of our life. How do we looks like? Did we made the right decission? In most cases we fear about failure because we are not sure about the success or a positive outcome of the situation and the consequences of our actions. This idea divide peoples minds to two sides, two ideology: shy, safety player and brave, risk taker. Both sides have pros and cons. Those who chose the safety game, are using they background knowledge what they learned for long years and made it highly sure to not fail it. The word shy is not the best representation for them just in that case when something new and unknown came in to learn. They dont take the risk to fail it and they obviously will not fail because they will not even try. That can be any situation like answer the question in class; try out a sport; go to the gym; wear a new cloth; ect. The only thing what is make a gate between them and to try it is the fear. They dont take the risk and they will never know the outcome. If its a fail then they take it as a lose. Maybe the only thing what is a benefit in their thinking they will really not going to lose anything but then the successes will come lesser. Also that doesnt mean they are not risk takers or they live in constant fear, its just more safer. The cases where they are need to take steps can be not that scarry or its doesnt need to be a big deal. These type of people are already made mistakes and the reason why then fear to try it again the previous experiences. Said something dumb in class and everyone laughted; tried a sport be he/she was not succes at all; in the gym he/she felt unconfortable because he/she was not that strong like the people around them, ect. On the other side those people who trying out new thigs and got experience are usually the ones who make something in their lives what will stand for them after time. Great example for this is the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill itself. His life shows the importance of trying. If we just think about how he becamed a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, its easy to realize it was not always easy for him. Biography of his life tells us how many times he tried and failed but even through he gained success. People like Churchill are thinkers and they take the failures as a lessons of the life. For them is a learning process of making an idea perfect; make an action successful; decide a the right way; answer a question rightfully. If a fail cames up after a wrong move they face with it and they are most importantly proud of it. Not proud about what they failed, about the correction, the knowledge what they gained and driving them to avoid the same and similar fails. Yes they can make the same mistake again but at the end they will be the winners. And this is the point where the enthusiasm came in. People are trying to reach their goals and enthusiasm drives them. Winston Churchill won the World War II because his goal was to not fail his people, the mankind, and everything what he built. Enthusiasm can have different faces like duty as a president, joy like an istrument player, or to bring happyness like a parent. To keep the enthusiasm is depending on the person. The goal what is requires it can be lesser, greater, midling, makes no difference. The person who keeping it is matters, not the size of the goal because anyone can be a president if he/she really wants it but cannot go to the gym a few times a week if he/she is lazy and dont have enough willingness in their heart. That is a close connection with our life goals. Doesnt matters if its short or long tearm goals. That enthusiasm can broke after fails or can be even stronger than before. My example is with the martial art also an example for this. I learned how to dual wield the nunchaku and the learning process was painfull. Im right handed and to learn, just to spin it, with my left hand hurted me. I was hitting my forearm thousand times. My skin was red after an hour of practice. People asked me why do I still trying and why do I dont stay down. The reason why I didnt stoped was my enthusiasm in my goal to master the nunchaku. After months of practice I did it successfully and in these days Im not a master yet but at least I cannot hit myself. A lot of people who going to failure to failure are also taking a risk to fail to the point where they cant try it again. That means a fail where a people can die. These are specific cases but not just death can stop us. Also there are situations where a person just become unable to do thing what he/she did before. And yes there also situations after tragedies where we can stand up stronger than before. There was a boy who loved to ride his bicycle and do tricks with it. One day he had an accident with it in a car crash and he lost his leg. He was in wheelchair for months but doctors offered him a chance to make him a plastic leg. He spent a lot of time in recovery and when he was able to move by himself he wanted to return to his dream. For a lot of time he failed to do anything with his bike. He was angry and broken. But he didnt gave up. After failing again and again he finally on his bike again. In these day he riding like before the accident because he never give up. His strory is inspire me. I agree with Winston Churchill. We need to fail to learn and enyoj what we reach. We need to try and train not till we can get it right, till we cant get it wrong. And we need a goal to be enthusiastic and to never lose it, to make it stronger after every fail. We can stay in our comfort zones and try to avoid the fails or we can face with them and get experience.

I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people dont get along because they think different about each other. In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when Im going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if Im going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I dont know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, Im going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions.

Introduction: We can see to simple nudes ayes when some people have the high enthusiams and we can detected if a person are sad, happy, when you talking or with yours expressions to the other people. The people who have enthusiams are the persons who ever have more people in the around whos can help them, so if they see a person sad, they go where him and they try to be happy him again or they asked you how they can help that person, but a person who doesnt have enthusiams they worry about to other people. People who have enthusiams: They can to do all whatever they wants, because they are happy. They can create a grat ideas when they are happy in that moment.

If your enthusiams is bad, dont be alone. If you dont have enthusiams, you doesnt wants to do anything.

210,2375,AE0DB193F5B5,"Today, in the actuality, a lot of people have a big dreams that we can to complete have a better life for our future family or also to own self but a many people be surrender becuase most of the time have the fuilures, when they are doing something; I think that our life without the fuilures will be bored and easy becuase we dont have the energies to work hard or fight for our goals or dreams. I agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because you can help other to complete their dreams or their goals, also you can have more spirit and a positives attitudes than you have in the begging, also you can be a successful and strong person. You can help others to complete with their dreams or their goals, because sometimes a lot of people who want to comply their dreams or goals they dont have the motivation of their families or the economy necessary to buy all the studies or all the things that they need, so when you finish all the goals that you make you, you can assist to others. I know an experience of child from Mexico, his name was Generic_Name. Generic_Name was a child with the low economy resources, I remember that he toll us all the things that he was comply to get a better life for his family and him self. So one day, Generic_Name received a big notice from a presidency of Generic_City, the place were we live, that he can have a opportunity to study whatever he want. He and his family were happy for the big opportunity that Generic_Name have. At pass of the years, when Generic_Name finished study the collage, I know that Generic_Name is a big entrepreneur from a big company that he created after finished the college. Today, also Generic_Name likes help other people who want to be a successful in their life like the presidency help him. In my observation to be a good person likes Generic_Name makes that you have a lot of open opportunities to get the success or the things that Generic_Name every day was dreamed. Also you can be a successful and strong person because all people knows that the life is not easy and less if you want to do something hard or something that you need put a lot of time in it to pursuit of success and if you think that your goals or dreams are difficult to complete. Sometimes we need strive more that the people or your mind think. Another of my experiences is when was in Mexico, I was little girl, I remember that most of my days I talked with my family, my mother, my father and also sometimes with my grandfathers; about that I want study the High School in Untied States because I saw a TV Shows and movies shows all the schools and also my father lived a lot of years in this country so, he talk me about the schools, the teachers, the classmates, the classes and classrooms that were to different form my country, the lunch time and I think that the thing that was more exercise was with the lockers because in my country dont have lockers or something to put our things likes books, pencils, notebooks and sometimes, the food. At the time that was grow up, I was continue with the same mentality to come to this country to comply my studies. I remember that have a lot of failures in the time to the arrival to United States but,even if never let that my thoughts or the commentaries of the negative people will be fell bad about my big dream. I think that was a strong person because is hard to come to other place with different culture and customers in everything and also is hard and sad separate to the persons who love. Other might say that the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success does not matter or they are disagree because you can lose your forces to continue and accomplish your goals and sometimes this failure can make us fell sad. However, you can have more spirit and positives attitudes than you have in the begging because when you have a failure in something that you study a lot or put your all time in it, you can have the mentality that you can to do well it, just you need strive a little be more that you make before. This is one of my experiences in my life; the last week, in my History class with Generic_Name, we have a quiz form the first unit so, we did the quiz, but the majority of my classmates and me, we dont pass the quiz, my teacher talked with us to give us a another opportunity to pass it. A lot of my classmates tell her that they do not were think that they can pass it even though they study a lot before the retake but, I have the spirit and the positives attitudes that I can passed the quiz with a good grade and study well at home. I think that my experience, it is good example because a lot of people who want to complete their dreams does not matter the times that they need to try to get a good result and a good recompense for the effort that they make. In my opinion, I think that Churchills statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" it is important and I agree with it because you can motive other people to be a good person with good feelings and goals, another reason is because you can to be a successful and respectful person and you can have a good attitudes through haved a bad results, every time you need stay be happy.

211,3504,AF4A2E8AD2A5,"Some people argue that working in a group has more benefits then working working alone. Some people also argue that working alone has more benefits then working in a group. Working alone is more beneficial the working in a group because, if one person in the group does not come to school the group will be short a person, if a member in the group does not care about the project, and not everyone is going to agree with each others ideas and opinions. If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time. When being put with someone who does not come to school often will cause stress on the rest of the group and also a delay. When working alone the worry of a group member not coming to school is not a thing because its alone. When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone. When working alone there is none of this to worry about because it is a independent assignment. When working in a group not everyone is going to agree with each other on the same ideas. If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses. Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done.

212,3432,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us. New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think its also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes. Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation. Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing. My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents wont be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents wont have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that dont they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students. Healthy life with less risk of everything. This is my sincerity opinion and hopefully the Principal takes some ideas of what the students think and what is the best for all of us.

One reason why summer projects from students. Because if the student designed their project they can choose their projects. For example, some students need an essay project but teachers give harder projects for students and they cant do this projects. And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects. However, some teachers did not like to students choose their projects .This is not the only reason summer projects from students is good. Some may argue summer projects from teachers is good. This is because the teachers have more information about summer projects and they know what kind of projects is better for students. However, some students not have information about summer projects and they did not like to complete the summer projects from teachers in the summer.

215,1329,93B8C8DAFE20,"Doing projects at school is really fun when it comes to working in groups. I think working in a groups is more beneficial because of the extra help youll have. You wont have to work a lot because your group will help and share the project so that everyone has a chance in it. Group projects will show you how to work with others and maybe even help you make new friends. Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from. Working at school is hard. You get lightheaded and maybe even get tired. Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice. Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because youll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another. Projects of all kinds have to look good. Lets say your having a hard time trying to find the perfect color background for your poster. You can talk to your classmates who are in your group and ask them if they have any ideas of what color you should pick. Together you can find the perfect color and together you can make your project look perfect and maybe be the one that has the best project in your who class. Group working is so much better for everyone because youll learn teamwork, learn that youll always have help when you need it, and your projects will always look good and perfect. The more people in your group, the more help, care, and ideas youll have for your project. Youll learn something new from all of this and others will to.

Being successful isnt necessarily a way of failing so much its a way to show that your trying and trying while not giving up. I would have to agree on Mister Winston Churchill about ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In other words, I believe being the person whos mistakes or failures is someone successful because they didnt give up they believed on theyre selves and continued to work harder. First, when you seem to fail everytime but, you just keep believing in yourself thats how you know you want to be successful and when you look back at those days in either high school,work,or even at home. Youll noticed that those days werent perfect but, its a way for you to learn about your failures in the end of the day you become someone whose very successful. My parents told me to always believe in myself and to never give up and if you fail over and over then get back up and do better. Second, its not just us people who has failures but celebrities also had failures believe it or not. Celebrities went through what we went through. Classmates either said ""your not gonna be famous your just gonna fail."" or "" Your failures wont lead you to be successful youl only fail again."" They didnt care what theyre classmates said they just kept trying and trying until they made it. For an example, Will Smith he kept trying to be successful in the acting world and he once said that if it wasnt for his parents who told him to keep trying he wouldnt be where he is. Jackson Wang, his a Chinese artist who didnt think hed become successful but now people see him as an inspiring artist who is also in a Korean boy group. So in other words, if you keep failing then keep trying because youll become someone someday. In conclusion, Mister Winston Churchill is right about ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". His message about it would bring people to theyre feet and not give up. Just keep trying until you made it.

If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people. These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home. The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they dont like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesnt want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they dont want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them. The second reason is maybe other students dont like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students dont want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school. Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they dont need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people dont think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

Socend, the city manager called me to ask me if I am still interstiing about the postion or not I said yes I am intersting for it. Then he meet me at the work and said to me to get the position you have to do a lot of things before I gave you the position I said a lot of things like what, I am always dowing every thing at work.

220,952,97167C9DC677,"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in todays era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.

I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more. Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things. How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really dont want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if its not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people. Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this. So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If its happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it. ,7,6,6,6,6,6,1464,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
223,1561,ABFEE879153D,"I believe that graduating high school in three years is the best option out there, the reason why i support this statement is because, i myself im graduating early the reason why i decided to this was because, i felt like i was too mature for highschool and i felt like i could do more things that highscool will limit me from doing. So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool dont really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we wont even need after high school. Ok let look at it this way, when we take history classes in highschool are kids really going to remember what was George Washington favorite food? or when did the civil war began? yes i know it can be important for us to know our history but we shouldnt be taking it for four years non-stop. For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didnt offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he cant do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and its totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i shouldnt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they didnt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they shouldnt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop.

224,1761,D5588B5DD6FF,"Once The great artist Michelangelo said that ""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelos said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that. First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs. Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. At their junior year Generic_Names friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal. Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the danger will not be as big as it appears. As you can see, Michelangelos said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility.

If you hear that your friend participated on a school activity, and keeps talking about what they experienced , and you found it interesting. You can try joining a school activity and experience the fun time that they had in the activity. My last reason is that you can learn new things. If you hear about the math program in school and students kept talking about what they learned and how fun it was. You can get intrested and you will want to join the math program and experience what they experienced you might learn some new informations.

226,1240,4D816E688FBD,"This Essay Is about:To conserve energy and resources do we have to extening the school day two hours, four-day school week? My opinion about this question is that we dont need to extend the school day and go to the school four-day a week. Why? Easy, because if the students spend more time in the school everday, we just loose energy. We get tired, we are not focus in class, we forget what we learned, affect your communication with your family. We get tired even now, that we just come for seven hours. If we spend more time in the school, the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are. Getting tired students start loosing they energy and, they do not pay attention what the teacher is saying. Sometimes I feel like I cant anymore my body and my mind need to take a rest. Your mind start loosing power when you get tired. Get tired and do not have a good rest is not healthy. we are not focus in class. When you start the day after a good rest, your mind start the day fresh. If your mind is fresh, you get better focus and powerful mind to think about what you are doing. During the day after few hours, you start getting tired and, loosing focus about what you are doing. If we spent more time in class, we gonna get bored and we can start talking with the neighbor, distract the others students and interrupt the class. After the school time students are gonna be so tired (body and mind) that they will want to arrive at home take a rest, leaving the homeworks without do it. We forget what we learned. It is so simple forget what we learned during the day, specially if we are going fast and talk about different topics. If we extend the school day, we most see different topics and we will going fast,forgeting about the last topic. This happend because we lose focus,when we are thinking in the differents process and topics. When your mind is process one information (lets say ""Math"") and, you do not even practice for a while, you just get it and, the teacher pass to the next unit (beacuse the period is longer cause the extending school day), you most will forget what you learned last unit. Affect your communication with your family. how extending the school day, affect your communication with your family? Well, lets say the most of the time you are in the school, some parents work during the day. But in the afternoon when the kid arrive at home parents spend time with them. If extending the school day, by the afternoon the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are and, they just will want to take a rest the rest of the afternoon. You have three days of weekend to do what ever you want and, have a conversation with your family? of course you have an extraday now, but remenber thats just for students your parents still working one more day. The weekend the students can use it for homeworks that mean you do not have much time to have a conversation or pass time with your falimily. My conclution is: If you gonna get tired, do not gonna be focus in class or you will forget what we learned, it is not a good idea to extend the school day, because at the end do not bring anyhelp for students. And can be worth for some of them. Take a good rest, be focus in class and keep what you learned, those are the students beneficts. The extratime I spent on my homeworks at home plus the school day, it is enough to learnd and be focus on study and get a fresh mind.",7,6,6,6,4,7,1010,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
227,1043,AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given. Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them. Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class. Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students. Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.

228,2122,FB73ABAB1D14,"Students should have the right to elect their classes that they want to take in school, because its all about in how capable the students are or how much the students can learn if they have the chance to elect their classes. Its hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didnt had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of. However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school. The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, its something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the U.S they wont let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more. In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that. In my life experience, I have become successful in the things that I have done while being in school, because my parents always told to pick something that I would like from school, and I choose to practice sports and after choosing something that I considered good for me and my future, I received an scholarship for soccer. All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future.

231,1069,D96EF27304E5,"Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student. First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the childs guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades. Lastly, if the childs attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time. In conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity. More or less said the families have the most say in the deciding factor unless the students grades are dropping or starts to fail some of their classes. Their attendance towards meetings are bad or if they just dont go to any meetings. ",7,7,7,7,7,7,3045,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
232,1758,F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home. After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine. They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they wont be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home. Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away. In conclusion The school board shouldnt add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldnt be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.

235,2869,5098F28A2EF3,". It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another. Impressions can be changed because people mature in life. For example, my mother tells me all the time that I was not the same kid she raised because of my appearance and the way I act around others. So, it is because I have matured that I have changed, if I was 7 or 8 years old, I would be shay to talk to people and try to be polite to not cause problems. Also, people would never smoke or even talk back if their impressions matter like they did when they were little. So peoples impressions change when you get mature in life Impressions can be changed because of the people around them. For example, my little brother may not do all the things that he does now if it werent for my behavior around others, back then my little brother would be very shay to speak. Then he saw how I spoke to others; with security, courage, and calm. He learned that from me and now he talks to anyone he enjoys hanging out with. So, with people being and influence in someones life, you would make a good or a bad impacted on someones life which would change someones impression for sure. Impressions can be changed because the way life treats one another. For example, a week from my birthday I was going to turn 14 my dad got arrested; I did not feel like I wanted to throw a party, I hated everything cause I said to my self life isnt fair, Then the next morning in school, every ones impression of was that I never felt sad, I was a happy young teen; Until the next day everyone was wishing me a happy early birthday. I didnt feel happy about it because my mind was all caught up on my fathers arrest. People noticed that and their impression changed because I never felt happy in my life, everything went wrong. Instead of everyone greeting me every morning, they just gave me space because they thought that I was depressed and I was for a good time. Now people take me seriously now because I didnt make jokes. So peoples impression changes ever since they saw the way life wasnt fair. In conclusion, It has been said that 1st Impressions are almost impossible to change. This statement to me is wrong. Impressions can be changed not only because people always mature in life, but also people may change by others actions, and they way life treats one another.

Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someones life, and even you never give up, just do you and you will see the result at the end. First of all, Its amazing how much may be done if you always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking to much dont wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain dont feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because hes girlfriend didnt want to with him, for the fact that he only thing he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree.

These small acts of kindness could benefit the whole world, change it too. This could Create self reputation. Self reputation can be created a lot of different ways, but one kind and easy way is by being kind to others around you, this could help create or maintain relationships of any kind, another way this could benefit you is because sometimes other people will be nice to you in exchange this could impact you and others immensely, i know this from experience because sometimes i just give a simple short compliment to others and it lights up their day, and sometimes when i am feeling down and its noticeable, people are nice to me in exchange. This would make you more noticeable anywhere, people will know you as the kindest guy/girl around, so then people will ask you for a compliment or they will be nice to you. This next way i will be talking about could really help out our community, or even the whole world. This could change the world because, the world we live in is pretty corrupted in many ways, but we could change that by being nice to others, for example if you are nice to someone they are going to feel happy so that person would want others to feel happy so he is kind to others, so it basically just loops, if more people are kind then the more people they will influence causing more people to be kind. This could give others the reputation they want, like being more noticeable, i know this because it happened to me, i had just decided to be kind to others around my school, and it made me more noticeable, causing other classmates to be nicer in order to be more noticeable, so everybody wins practically. Lastly a really kind way to impact others with kindness is, you could make them feel better about themselves, like Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."" Like complimenting someone could make their day, and this impacts them and others around that person because they noticed that someone had been nice to that person and had made their day too, because its wholesome. You could change peoples lives, like it changed mine, i was usually around 11 years old, and i had some trouble at school and home, but the people that are my friends now, just made my whole year, maybe my whole life because i knew some of them were going to stay with me till the end. You could be kind to someone that really need support, like people that are having trouble at home and school, this could change their lifestyle into a more happy way.

238,3133,FFED00D6E0BD,"Do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goals and success without lose their enthusiasm? I agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, I think failure is the main key to people reach their goals because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort. First, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason in the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk thats something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they dont give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens. Secondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goals is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they dont have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make things happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life. Finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, thats something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal, they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they cant let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other ones success in life and they try to guide people into failure. In conclusion, there have been nothing that cant stop people to reach their goals and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capables of everything and they need to learn to not give up.

239,3020,2675A97C2B76,"Do you think being hounst at all times is a good thing? I agree with people who are hounst at all times because they dont lie and lieing can cause a lot of problems. No matter how old you are being hounst is a very good thing for kids, adualts and teenagers. I think you should be hounst at all times because if youer not hounst people wont trust you, and people can come to you for advice, it also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. If you are not hounst people wont trust you. Most people want to be trusted. People want to be trusted in a relationship, friendship and a parentship and most importantly you would want to be trusted in your family. Being hounst whould make people trust in you in many ways. However, you can be trusted be not lieing or makeing fake roumers. For example a girl in our school whould make up roumers and lie about an eight th grader. Therefore, after doing all that no one wanted to be her friend because they couldnt trust her. If you are hounst at all time people can come to you for advice. If your hounst your friends, sisters, classmates will come to you for advice because they would know you would have great ones. Mostimportantly they would trust you because youer hounst and they will tell you everything and ask for advice and you will tell them what sounds good and hounst .Therefore, if you hounst you can be trusted by good advice that might actully help that person. Being hounst also helps people with trust issues to know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst. Having trust issues can com from being dishounst and if youer dishounst with someone it really makes that person think that they cant trust anyone at all. Thats because they have been broke by that other person who keeps lieing. That shows me that being hounst is an amazing thing that everyone chould have. In summary being hounst is good for everyone .It could be hard for some people but you always have to remember you have to be hounst so, people could trust you, people could come to you for advice, it helps people with trust issues know that there are people out there that you can trust for being hounst.",7,7,7,7,7,5,508,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
240,2080,A643E3470F54,"No,I dont think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework. You cant even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep theyre getting and If kids come to school the next day,they wont get the information they need for their classes because theyre tired. Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in wont be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why theyre not getting enough sleep. Im not saying its impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it its likely students wont get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students cant graduate from high school. To rap this up I say that the main reason why I dont think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future. I hope the school boards read this and take time to considerate this idea that would just give another reason for students to fail in the future.",6,6,6,8,5,6,2227,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Sometimes it is not important to have a positive attitude to obtain success. In other words you just have to find your talent and prove in a different way that you can be successful. Clearly not everyone needs to have a positive attitude to have an accomplishment. Surely having a positive attitude is beneficial to accomplish effectively what your proposes of life should be.

246,2444,9C3D2911E32D,"Have you ever thought of the affect of going out after 10 p. m. at night? Night time is the scariest period of the day; nothing is more dangerous and harmful than at night. People would rather stay at home than going out at night. A city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer, teenagers can stay out of trouble and they can have more time to spend with their family. However, some people think that curfews would unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because they might have an emergency and everyone has freedom to do what they want. In some cases, for instance, teenagers might have an emergency or something important at night that they need to be there as soon as possible, city council cannot let them stay at home. It will be unfair if other people can go out at night, but not teenagers. Everyone has freedom to do what they want, others cannot force teenagers to stay at home everyday after 10 p. m. at night. Although some people think that having curfews are not a good idea, I still insist that the adoption of curfews for teenagers would be a fantastic idea. In the first place, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because it is safer. It is very scary if teenagers hang out at night because someone might follow or kidnap them without they notice. No one knows what is going to happen next. Staying at home not only keep teenagers safe, it also make them be caution to everything around them. Furthermore, teenagers need to protect themselves from others, so that they will not get hurt. In short, it is necessary to adopt curfews for teenagers because they will be safer. Additionally, it is important for teenagers to have curfews because they can stay out of trouble. Teenagers nowadays have a very playful mind and they would do anything to enjoy themselves; however, they can get into trouble very quickly. Curfews can prevent and stop teenagers from breaking the law. They can stay at home and do something productive and meaningful to themselves. Moreover, curfews can prevent teenagers to meet harmful people outside of the society and make a bad decision. Therefore, a city council should adopt curfews for teenagers because they can stay out of trouble. Lastly, it is a great idea for a city council to adopt a 10 p. m. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers because they can have more time to spend with their family. Spending time with their family is the best moment that nobody wants to miss. Instead of going out with people below standard and breaking the rules, teenagers can have a wonderful time with their family at home. Because of curfews, the relationship between teenagers and their family will grow and be healthier. To sum up, it is nice to have curfews because it helps build up a better relationship. In conclusion, it is the best idea to have a city council adopt curfews for teenagers because it can protect teenagers from danger and risk, they will less likely get into future conflicts, and they can have an enjoyable time to spend with their family. Curfew benefits both teenagers and the law. Curfews can raise the world to a higher level and make a clean society for all teenagers. Lets make the adoption of curfews come true!

For example, if you have a test and you have a negative thought about something, dont automatically think youre going to fail, look over your test and check for any mistakes you might have made. Then when you are done checking over the test and feel better about it, then you should tell yourself you are going to pass it. Having a positive attitude can change your life completely. It is always important to have faith in yourself. You got this! The next thing is when you are out in public, it is always important to give a good and happy attitude to the people you see. Even if you dont know them, it can make anyones days. It can makes you a better person just by smiling at a person. You never know if that person is having a bad day and just by giving them a smile and a few words, it can make their day better. Another thing is if you are a teacher or parents and youre having a rough day due to a personal or medical problem, still try to give the kids a possible attitude. They look up to you and care about you. They dont deserve to be yelled at over the smallest things that wasnt even their fault. Having a negative attitude towards the students or your children is not a good thing. You might hurt their feelings or even worst think that they are not good enough for you. You are not being very successful if you keep on yelling at innocent children or even your own kids.

So If you ever feel unsure about something, look over and think what feels right to you. Also if you see a strangers, kids, etc, smile. It can make anyones day just by seeing that one smile.

This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless. You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished.

Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it. So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what youre suppose to do. Its great to help yourself in life because you dont know how good it would turn out in the end. There is people that i know that always worked hard for what they wanted in life and got what they needed. Such good things could happen to anyone.

People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect. Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces. Some people decide to date someone through social media when it isnt a good idea to do. People can fake identities to make people think theyre another person. people decide to not say who they really are, so they could either kidnap them or make the person theyre tricking to send them money if they live in another country. Its rare that people find someone who doesnt lie about who they are. Some people probably decide to date through social media because they think that they wont find anyone who will really like them. Most people who have technology now use them to communicate with other people instead of in person. Most people decide to communicate through online or text so that they dont see the persons face. People feel more brave to tell a person something mean or hurtful through text or anything. People just decide to not talk, but instead to text. Most people feel like technology has a good effects when it mostly doesnt.

258,3737,3C78D0790E7B,"Is Emerson right about the statement he wrote? Emersons statement stated that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this statement because it lets you know that anyone can push for a higher acomplishment in their own life. As well, reading the passage gets people thinking on their goals, if they should push to reach for higher limits. Ill tell you why Emersons statement is right. As a start, many people are inspired by Emersons statement and its made them believe more in themself. Having a powerful statement can really open other peoples eyes to strive for high goals. As well, push boundries that they never thought they had. People with start to have faith knowing they can rise above their own expectations. For example, many people give up and stop trying to reach their goals. Then they have no idea on what they want to do or what they can manage to do. In fact, people who past beyond thier own boundries have a successful life style. They start to know what they can handle and how to fully succeed, It make them feel like they can complete any type of task that theyre given. People start to feel better on themself knowing what the can do. Some people say its a weight lifting feeling they get once they find out what they were missing out on. For example, people ened up over thinking things and made it harder on them self for not achiving the goals. As a matter of fact, People end up gaining more experiance on what they do. They also start to want to take on new challenges so they can have more experiance. They want to be filled with many different ways to have a strong mind and successful life style. People who has gained so much experiance can get any type of work within seconds because of their experiance, nothing has ever stop someone from believing they can do more. For example, people with the most experiance struggle less for work. In conclusion, Emersons statement shows a strong componet in peoples lifes. Making it one of the most insperational quotes that has ever existed. People start to end up valuing in themself more then they ever thought they could. People who cant do things that are beyond their own ability hasnt grown yet. Many of the people are too scared to reach for higher expectaions when they have the ability to take it.

However, I think the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology have negative effects because people prefers to shop on online than stores, people use more technology to talk, and also children plays with technology than with another person or toys. Today, people prefers to shop by online than stores. I saw and lived this experience many times about buy by online but I not feel comfortable as a store. Online shops makes feel lazy, alone, and when you have questions obout the product nobody can answer you. I bought by online many times but one day I understand that online shop is not healthy for me because when I go to stores Im practicing my English vocabulary, I walk alot that means that I doing a little exercise, and meet new places and people. Shop by online avoid the human contact and gives negative effects on peoples lives. People use more technology to talk, as facetime, facebook, whatssap or others applicationes. I agree to talk with this aplications with people who lives far away but I prefer to join with my friends or family to talk who lives close. Sometimes, I came out with my sister and their friends who always are in their phones texting or taking pictures. In my personality, use the phone when you are sharing with another person is not respect and you are not enjoying the moment. The use of phones during a meeting avoid the interaction with other human, and gives negative effects on the peoples live. Finally, children more plays with technology than with another child or toys. In the past, children plays with toys or they made their own toys.

However, the use of technology had have negative effects on peoples lives. There are three reasons very clear about it. First, technology has a lot of wed-sites which attracted to most people. Therefore, when you walk in the park or wherever you go, you will see most people with their eyes into their phone, ipad, computers or another device. As a result, there are many road accidents or even some parents lose their children in the mall. Second, students are not productive in their classes. They do not need to read a book, to find the information what they need because everything is in the internet. In other words, technology is more intelligent than our students. Finally, technology has ended up with our social life. Nobody what to talk with other person without use his phone. In adittion, the comunication between parents and children, can not be possible these days because they are very busy surfing on internet. They spend a lot time in their devices, when they are in the store, in the house, in the work, even in a date.

Most people wanted to get better after they have had worked on themselves to be successful already, but in the other hand, people did not have opportunity to go to school. or may be they just did not feel confident enough that they could be better. In my opinion, I think that people should try their best to be something that will benefit other people so that you gain support and just keep expanding. The first reason why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. The more you have experience in something, the more chances you have on getting better at it. I think that getting better at something is really important in life in order to live a good lifestyle. But some people are not able to make changes to their selves. They maybe dealing with family issues or personal issues that is keeping them to take advantage of changing. Another reason why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. Most people have skills that they learned when they were young which is considered knowledge. That specific skill or knowledge might help you advance something. But at the same time a lot of people have disappointments on their selves and surroundings, which can cause the thinking of not changing to the better. The final reason of why I agree on Emeersons statement is because. Most people when they are confident and comfortable, then they would release the skills and persuade the change that is going to make them a better person, and that could change their life forever. it is convenience and worth making the change no matter what the situation be so do not take advantages the wrong way After all, there has been a lot of different opinions and ideas all around the world, but you as an individual should know what is best for you. we have talked about why and why not people should move up to the next step which is changing. changing can harm or improve you if you do it the right way, by taking chances since young then, most of us would have a lot more better strategies and know what is right from wrong by the time we grow.

Even if you dont believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It cant hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesnt make sense to try and understand a concept that wont make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I cant grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why its not possible to master difficult problems. Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because its not so much a person cant grow but dont have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement.

264,3868,CBFD5CD8BCD9,"Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe. City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be. Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why. If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story.

Although some people believe we choose our own character, nevertheless, our character are influences beyond our control because technology influences our traits and famous people can influences our traits and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. To begin, video game can influenced our traits. For example, my own experience say 3 year ago I start play video game, when I star play with my friends. We always say that when we grow up we like to do what they are doing because their life look good. Also, we start doing the same things as the game like dancing, and thinking same as the game, and acting like them. Our others friends who do not play the game they tell us, that we are change our traits because we are acting like them too. One day we released that game was influenced our character. Clearly, because we star thinking in the future our life same as the game, and that we can do our future as we see in the game easily. Furthermore, famous people influenced our traits. To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty. Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us. To concluded, our character are influenced beyond our control because video game can influences are traits and famous people can influences our traits, and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. technology influenced our character in form that we that life be like them and people can influence our change in the form the we do thing only, because we see they are doing then older people want to change our though to what they thing. To conclude, our character traits can be influences in different ways that we never expect that can happen.

266,1805,8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people dont have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jeffersons statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something. To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker. For example, When you are given a task to complete you cant sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete. Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you cant possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I dont like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal. On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers. They say this because most high schoolers wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but cant stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably dont know whats going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future. In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",9,7,7,8,7,8,1883,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

268,2323,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone. To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the stores stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals. Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future. As can be seen, it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine. If the whole world have the willing to keep learning despite they are mastered in something already, they will be more professionals and a wealthier society.",8,8,8,8,8,9,937,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

I myself have gone through that where had gone to an alternative school so i could have more time to work in the day and come home to do some of my courses. Many people say education is the number one thing you should worried about and thats right, though some kids cant cause they have to help there family to provide in relation to paying some bills, put food on the table or picking up there siblings. providing school to be done at home will help the kids that have to go through all of this. high school can be hard at times work is stressful some kids hate to having to get up early is hard for them so they miss out in some of class time. You keep missing some of class every day it can turn into hours of class time that you missed, also can effect in the way you are learning having more time in your day to work can help you for there you are learning at your own paste, not the teachers. Some students that learn slow. takes time for them to learn one thing and by then the teacher is on the next unit there learning about. everyone has there own way that they learn better students that are fast learners wish that they can learn everything faster to get the class over with to go on to the next. those students can get classes online so they could do them at home to get the most credits they want this would also help them graduate faster. Very few kids know what they want to work as for there career. Doing online classes can help these students graduate earlier to go the school they want to go to, or there career they want to lean on. This can help these students out in many ways. Going into a career path the earliest you can is a great thing you can get more time to learn and get good at to what you want to be doing like working become a master tech the younger you are the more experience you could have when you get older. The more chances you can get to become the best master tech at your location.

270,3812,A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in todays day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think its hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you dont learn if your not taught in life. Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse wed be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. Youd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesnt blow up on you. Id love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again. Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because its affected my everyday life. Through this Ive mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me. All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you wont grow at all. The human brain is meant to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

In my opinion working in group is better them working alone. Because friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we all can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And we dont feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing alone. Friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. And we all put our interest to do the best as we can with the work. And we try that the work look good and nice. Also we put our effort to do the work and that the teacher see that we all work together. And we try our best to do the work the way that she or he wanted to be. And friends or partners can be good if we need to do a drawing or with the hand writing. Also if youre partners help you with the work the teacher is going to sacrifice with the work that all of you are doing. We all do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Because we try that everyone have one part of the work. And that way we can finish the work fast. Also everyone participate in the work. And we all have some part of the credit. Also we try to do the work fast but also we try that the work look good. And we no just do the work fast because we want to finish quick and them do nothing. Sometime it because the teacher a specific time to finish and with a group we can finish on time and also the work can look good too. We dont feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing the work alone. We dont feel the work hard because we separate the work in parts. And if there is 4 in a group we all 4 do a list one part of the work. Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work. In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation. Because you have to intelligent and organize first and everyone know what they have to do we all can get a good grade in the work. Some of the benefits that we can get working in groups are. Work with friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And final we dont feel the job or work hard s we usually felt doing alone. Also working in groups it help to the development. For me it better working in a group have many beneficial and is very helpful to do the work good and nice foe the teacher can be proud of the group work. And also is mire fun to be in a group with your fiends and all of you get a good grade. ",6,5,6,5,4,6,1779,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
272,3154,E4124757C2B0,"I disagree with adding one and half hour to school each day because students would get tired and it would be more things to the students have to know. In our school we have 9 hours of school and if we add it would have 10 and I dont think students want to stay in school for a long time. I get that school is a place where you learn and school gets you a job and you can get a free scholarships to college without paying but at the same time students need 7 hours maximum so they would fit all the knowledge and all the subjects in there mind. Teachers want students to learn more because they want students to have a successful life and learn more but students have less time to listen because they want to go home .In our school we have 4 subjects were we have tests and some students fail it because there studying for other classes even though its not important like for example,elective classes,I get that elective is important to but students but its really not important. The important classes are Math,Science and Language arts, and History. The school board is not gonna like when students fail there tests when they have 10 hours in school each day. Students should have time when they get home to study so they can ace there test,Since our school is a Middle school we should have less hours so we can pass 6th,7th and 8th grade without having any difficult in school. Students wouldnt benefit if the time is longer they would not even pay attention to the teacher so i disagree with having one and half hour to school each day. On the other hand,I think i could agree to this because in order to become successful you have to study and work really hard and get enough to time to do your work. I think students would go to college if they had a lot of time and students would understand things better we should have a vote where students decide whether we should have one and a half hour or not so then the school board can see which one got the highest votes and they would decide if we should have a longer time or regular time. This year a lot of students are getting bad grades because there is so many tests and works they have to do and its always do on time so i feel like we should have less time in school so when you get home you have a study time. The school board will like this idea because being in school for us is so much and there is no point for staying 10 hours in school because teachers would get tired and students will get bored.

273,2331,D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"". Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didnt like or didnt want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldnt have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they? Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but wont read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what youre ordering comes with. Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because theyre hurting badly and doctors will say youre perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you dont need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist dont believe in that but most do. So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes dont know what theyre doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",7,7,8,7,6,6,2887,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
274,2787,8C645419E1B4,Others would not appreciate kindness. First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment. Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just dont show what kindness really looks like. Finally its not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad. Kind isnt always the best choice. First being kind isnt always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help. Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around its easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school. Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering. Dont be kind to those who arent good people First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore dont talk to them and shouldnt be kind to them. Also a reason to not be kind to those who arent good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right. Finally if you are getting annoyed by the person who is being mean to you than talk to a teacher about it and they can talk to the student about being kind to others.,6,8,7,8,8,8,1867,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

Churchchills is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do. If you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you dont know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can. Make a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well Im still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didnt know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I didt know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things. I was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they dont speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life.

Lastly, people will not support working 10 hours a day, because many people have their routine to work, or some of them have problems working to many hours, another reason why people can not work 10 hours a day is that they have their own routine work, as well student in school will not support to be in class. For example many student gets bored in class juts been 8 hours in school and if we compare there will be a lot if issue with their attendance. another point is many student work to support their self, so in that occation they will not available to work and make money.

First, the first thing we do is give the kids breakfast, and while the kids are eating two of the ladies are looking after them, and the others two, are planning the activity that the kids are going to be doing during the day and try to keep them busy. Also all ladies give ideas and at the end we try to put all ideas together and work on it as a team. While the day is passing, we do everything we need to teach and do the activities, and working all together is easily for us to finish early. when we finish early we always read or dance until the time to go home comes. Also we disgust who was the one that behave was good and we also give stars for the behavior to kids. Sometimes the kid dont behave well and if there were only one person taking care of the kids it most be difficult to do what we all four need to do. Also, everyone goal is to keep the kids safe,having fun, and also learning who to write, so at the time for them go to school they are going to feel relative and dont be scare of going to a regular school. And when that happen is how we know that we make a work together. As you see, I feel that is more beneficial working together in a group because, everyone in the group has ideas, is easily to finnish everything fast and also everyone has the same goal.",5,6,6,5,4,6,3797,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

290,3800,E733508EEB84,"I think we cant compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work. To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school dont have to follow, First, we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and thats not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students. Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school. Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things, so they will not have time and thats will be a reason why they can left the school. Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time. Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they cant do all. People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week. Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit. One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off. Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they dont have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do. students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn. Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do. all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day. In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages . I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change.

A lot people is afraid to be themselves which is mean show to the world who they really are. For these and many reasons is why i am agree with Emersons statement because if you obtain to be yourself you are gonna be unique,you are gonna follow your dreams,and you are gonna be confident. Everyone is trying to do the same things that someones else does, but imagine being unique you would be different from other people you would play or practice any sports that you want. You can get your own style use or create your own clothes, and start to use your imagination. You do not have to be worry for follow any fashion because you would have your own sunshine. Dreams? I am pretty sure that you have dreams like I do, but my dreams migth be differents from yours, probably you want to be a doctor and i want to be a singer. However if you get to find yourself you are follow your owns dreams you will be more happy that anyone else doing the things that you love. You are gonna enjoy your life every single day, every moment ,and everywhere. You alwalys are gonna get the positive side of the things even in your bad days because you are gonna love what you have and what you do. In this time be confident is something really hard for many people but if you are a confident person you will not care about what people say, which is mean you are not gonna care about they opinions because you will be focus in your goals .You will belief in yourself, in your decisions do not matter what will happen. You will be an example for many people who does not felling in the same way that you do and you migth inspire them to follow their dreams. In conclusion be yourself does not matter what people say or what they want for you,live your own life because life is only one. Get your own goals ,and do not try to be like someone else, do not follow their style because if you do not be yourself ,you are never ever gonna be happy with your life and you will not get all the things that you want in your future.

This would be a great thing to do because it would be helping people. Helping people is a awesome way in showing how much people care about other people. For an example; if we were to be require to take community service at school, some students would be need of help in math, language arts, science, social studies or anything that a student would need help in and would be able to receive help. This would make our learning increase and more student would be going to college. Parents, teachers, and even students want the best for themselves and with a help that each student could get it would make students comprehend and understand what the concept or subject they are working with. It will also make teaching easier. Having community service will make students want to be focused in doing good things such as helping students or people and doing things that wont lead them to bad things. Community service will also help the community in having good and safe home and nice people around them. Thats why i believe the principle should require community service to each student.

Because reason #1 is that we are in school for 8 hours doing work and other thing and we get tired and its just to much forus kids or grown ups. Reason #2 is you dont have a lot of time to do your childhood things cause your in school for 9 hours and 35 mins. For example you just cameout of school your tired you what have fun but then you got to do homework and that can take hours to finish your done but you cant go outside cause its to dark and your parents wont let you cause of hours of school. Thats reason #2. Reason #3 is homework you always get home almost every single day doing some extra work and is can take hours to finish. For example you come out of school at 4:00 your tired but you got homework and then you finish your home for like 2 or 3 hoursof extra work but you cant do anything really fun like go out somewhere with freinds cause its to late and dark. Thats reason #3. Reason #4 is a appointment you always come out school at 2:45 and your appointment is at 3:00 but you cant go cause you got extra hours in school i know you can leave early but waste you child or grown up learning time in school. Thats reason #4. I get it if yall schools set extra time in school just to make us smart,or have a good life,and a good job,but us kids and adults need time for are own self so this is all my reason and examples that I disagree for having extra time in school.

I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms. First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we cant stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes. Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We cant just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance. In conclution I must said that I agree with Endersons quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty. So we can leave a better future for our childrens.

When you go outside in your backyard you can have family over and do many activites for example you can plant a garden with your family and get very messy and mudy but still make your backyard look very nice. Other activites you can do is play soccer, have a water ballon fight with family, play in your pool, play football, and play with your pets if you have any. This list can go on and on but I will stop here for now. Lets just say there are so many activites to do in your backyard. The best part of going outside is inviting your family over and take a walk,ride your bike, and walk to the park. The advantages of taking a walk is similar to being outside in your backyard. The only differences is your walkng and your children fall asleep a lot faster. These two activites have many things in common. One of a example that these two activites have in common is you get to spend time with your family and pets. Who wouldnt want to spend time with their family or pets if you have any.

306,830,D4490C9F73B9,"It has been said first impressions are almost impossible to change, but Im not agree with it because people always change and the first impression doesnt define who you are. The people always change to good or bad. For example, I met someone that in the first time I saw him he was mad, he never smiled, and he was very shy. And at the pass of the days he was changing, he started to smile, and he wasnt mad like the first time I saw him. Now my impression changes and now I can see that hes different and the first impression I had about him changed at all. Another example could be that in the first days of classes your teacher is nice, doesnt give you homeworks, and he is patient with the students. However, He is changing every day. Now hes always mad, now he gives you a lot of homework, and hes yelling in class. At this time, the first impression you had about the teacher totally changed because hes not the nice teacher that you met in the first days of classes. The first impression doesnt define who you are because first impression is like a front of a book and the front of the book is nothing comparable to the that is inside of the book. For example, I have some friends that told me that the first time they saw me they didnt like me because they says that Im always mad and I was a boy that dont talk with anybody just with my friends and they told me that they never thinked that Ill be their friend, but they were knowing me and they saw that I was different from their perspective and from the first time I met them, so they changed their first impression about me and their point of view about my personality. Another example, is that some people thinks that youre like they think just because they have a bad first impression about you. I mean sometimes we dont have good days and we are not like always. Lets go to suppose that in those days you met a person and youre having a bad day, youre mad, and with problems, so that person will think youre like that because that person will have a bad impression about you, but if that person have the time to know you better, he will see that youre not like he thinks you are just because the first impression about you is bad. If he is knowing you better, he will change his impression about you compare to the first time. Clearly, the first impression always is going to change because one impression doesnt define my personality and how I am and I can change that impression. It have to be like more than two impressions to know a person because it will be hard to changes those impresions.",6,6,8,6,6,6,2959,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Sometime you can change people impression of you if they get to know to know you. if your first impression isnt good it can messed up they stuff you do in life like a job interview if you dont a good impression you may not get the job. If you move to new place and your going to a new school, your going to need to have a good impression to make new friends because if your new and a lot of people dont know you and if you do something weird or dumb everyone at your new school is gonna have a bad impression of you and that may cost you to make new friends and sometimes someone may bully you for being weird. Some kids at school have bad impression and people talk about them behind their back and their made fun of them for being weird. Like if your in a sport team and your that one kid who always bragging about how good they are, people around you wont want to be around you if they know your always bragging and they will spread rumors about you and people will stop talking to you if they know you like talking about yourself and people wont want to be your friend. If you wanna ask out the girl you like and she heard you did something to a another girl, shes going to have a bad impression of you and she wont even want to talk you and your tried to ask her out shes gonna reject you.

309,3358,E2456BDC6648,"Conserving energy and resources by attending less days to school. Adopting a four-day school week and only adding two more hours; each day consisting of nine hours. It will help to reduce the consuming of energy and resources. As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the schools building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they dont live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people. To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged. Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. Thats one of the best ways to conserve cars energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas. Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that dont have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well. Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs. In conclusion, Adopting a four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources.

311,1813,F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages. First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school. second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students dont work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear. In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day.

Teachers just hand out papers and papers of homework without thinking about it. meanwhile, students are trying to study for important stuff like tests,sols or exams. I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,my work is more important. We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes its just too much. This is why we want to go on field trips or go outside more often. Schools are not the most funnest place to be. Many schools, like Generic_School, are extremely stuffy and dirty.

For example, when the person are positive that will make the person have a lot of friends, if the person are positive that makes him/her happy, and the person will pass all his/her test with good score or in his/her job be the smarter one. First, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because when the person positive that will makes him/her have a lot of friends. For example, Generic_Name always smiling and positive. So, everyone in her school loved her and they want to be friends with her. So, now she is positive girls with a lot of friends. Being positive makes the life more better. As well as, if the person are positive he/she will always be happy. Second, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because that help the person to pass all his/her test with good score or in their job to be the smarter one.

Also he is the good person in his job. Positive person will have the most beautiful life and will live with peace. Some people may argue that to try to be a positive person because the world we born on sometimes have a lot of problems. That is true because the world looks like the mountain sometimes hard to claim it, and the life looks the same usually its hard to be happy and positive because sometimes their is a problem or something happened makes you feel sad, and negative, and makes you feel that you hate your life, but everyone have to try to be positive, and to love his/her own life because if the person always negative that will makes him/her sick, sad, mad, and complicate.

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives? Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty. Especially when phones are advancing in the next years. One day, technology will take over the human population. Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media, but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc. They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but theres rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully youll be there too. Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone, but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it? Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face. Honestly everyone who does this, should just atleast try it and see whats more than life, then just being on the phone most of the day. Once the day comes everyone will just destroy their own phone to prevent from robot abomination. Sticking together as one, we can stop phone users and type of electronic device to end this obsession once and for all. Opening up to someone, its like a flower is about to blossum. Seeing that special someone is a delight! Through peoples lives this is a negative thing toward human lives.

On the Other hand If you do try your best and the work you completed is good, and someone gives you a lot of compliments then it helps you build a better self-esteem. Therefore you got to be self confident also, why? because if youre self confident and you apply for a job you will manage to be confident that you will get that job, when you go to an interview. If you practice to be self confident It will help you a lot in the near future. If you got an affinity for a type of shoes and someone else tells you theyre ugly how will you feel? Of course you will feel some type of way because thats just how the human body works, but you know what? It dont matter what people think. If you Got an affinity for those type of shoes then it dont matter what people got to say about your shoes. At the end of the day its what you like not what other people like. People will always judge you no matter what you wear, what you look like, and how speak. Always remember that only god can judge you. Therefore you should take the negative stuff that people got to say, and turn them into something positive. That will help you build up better self-esteem because you always got to be yourself no matter what.

Although, many people argue that technology is affecting the people saying that human spend most of their time using technology, for things that are not productive. I think that technology is good because you need it for your daily. For example, if you are a student you can use technology to help you to do homework, project, or specific things that require technology. However, there are some people that need technology for their life that is require, if you are very sick doctors will have to use technology to understand what sickness do you have. To begin with, using technology you can do many things at the same time that can help you in your daily. For example, there are some time when you have a lot of things to do, and you dont have a lot of time, but if you use technology you will able to make it, because you can do many things at the same time with technology. Also, technology help you with your job, now there are many machines that you can use in your job that does not need any force of your body, those machines work by using technology. If you work as a security you can security the building by just be in one office and use technology, you can install cameras around the build and you can security the building from that office by using the camaras, so you wont have to be walking around all the build, and will take you a lot of time to make it. Second, technology can make your life easier. People require to technology when there are things that human can not do. For example there are some job that are very hard that require a big force that is impossible for human, but they can use some special machines that are very strong and can do the work. Also, you can search in google things that you dont know. For example, address,news, thing about History, books it is much easier to read a book in google than going to the library that take you more time than just type the book tittle in google. Finally, technology also help schools, every schools use technology for their information. For axemple teachers have computer where they has the information of their students, where they has their work all the materials that they need to teach. Also, teachers have special programthat they use to teach, make easier their work. However, teacher, and schools do almost all their work by using technology. in addition, students need technology to do their classwork when it require to use computer, or personal divice. In conclution, technology is super inportant, helpful for everyone,and eveything. People wont be able to do the work or things that they do now without technology. Humans need it for our benefic to make our life easier. Life wont be the same without technology, schools, Hospital, Banks, everything could be different.

322,1059,7B0C76128726,"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldnt give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success. If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who dont lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain theyve claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice. In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",7,8,6,7,7,7,1620,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
323,1795,14AC534FFE42,"graduating early is a very good idea but before start with my opioun or make any suggestions i would like to take sides first. graduating early comes with a lot of work and troubles . before you will be able to graduate early, you will need two math , two science ,two history and other elective subjects to graduate .but if you dont have any of that or maybe failed some classes in your freshmen year or sophomore year, its all pales up and wait for you in your senior year. or maybe you refused to go to summer school or even take some classes during the summer, its affect you in your senior year. summer school sometimes help you to reduce some classes during your school year. Every high schoolers"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you dont do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good GPA to college , you might as well want to stay and wait for your traditional four years. Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they dont. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her. But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit. And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging. Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early its very hard sometimes because you wouldnt know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schoolers should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

325,3839,CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is. The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year. The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year. Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they dont forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year. In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Dont fix it if it aint broke.""",10,9,10,8,8,8,2806,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 10"
326,3643,4B6DF39107CC,"Is it a good idea to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year? Based on my experiance in high school, i disagree with students who graduate high school in three years, besause students can take college credits while they have short schedual on their senior year, and also they can get into the clubs that would give them the idea of that they would do after the graduations. In order to graduate high school in three years students must take summer school, give up on their elective courses, and give up on their vacations. Students have to take three years of summer school in order to graduate high school early. They are required to complete all the credits that is neccessary for graduations. They must complete the requirements for graduation before it is too late. If the students chooes to skip one year of summer school credit they cannot graduate in three years, and they will have rough time trying to cought up. If they still got lazy than there is no other way to graduate then four years plan. This is where their whole stuggles end up, and they still have to be in school for the fourth year. Students have to give up on their electives during their high school year to graduate. They will have full schedual of requirements to finish up. They have to work hard, do all the work for all of their classes, turn in almost every homework for their classes. They will be struggling during school year since they do not have an elective class that they will be not hard to think about, also some schools offers courses that would give students the ideas for their college life, such as Generic_School. It is an engineering courses that give the students idea of what they would do if they want to be an engineer. Students will give up on their summer vocations because they will be taking summer school to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year. However students will be doing their school stuff while others will be celebrating their vocations. Students who want to finish up their schools early, they will be attending summer schools. Becide it they also be working, and maybe they wonld not have time to complete their assignments on time, it will make them to change their opinnoin on early graduation, they will give up on their early graduation plan. To conclude, it is not the best choice to graduate high school in three years, additionally students would have rough and tamble time trying to finish high school. Therefore, it will be better if they stick with a normal school time and finish high school in four years, it will help them to get more knowledge, and better undrestainding of that they would do for their oncoming life. For the majority of people its better to graduate high school in four years, even though if they are aiming for advance deploma they will need to take full four years of high school, and summer school as well, but if the students are going for standard deploma they will have short schedual, and they can take advantage if it and take college credits for free on their senior year.

Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""What should I think about this person?"". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, theyre opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised. Second, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said. Second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones.

They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you dont get motivated as the people that works in groups. Working in a group is better because people can share their ideas with the other people in the group and they can do a very good work using all those ideas. Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and thats fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do. Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little bit boring because they dont have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct. Third, people can edit their work many times without asking other people what they think about it. Another reason is that people does not have other people rushing them.

The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks.

Most of the time we tend to think that because were adults we are doing the right thing, but instead were doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before youre life falls apart. Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that theirs no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with youre life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what youre going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions. The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured youll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case its easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with youre life. After all maybe guidance isnt a good place to go. One of the reasons that people dont seek for guidance is that its too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, youre not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does. In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices. As we grow we deal with so many things and sometimes its good to always talk with an expert. After all were not perfect but the best decision for you is to seek guidance.

339,2056,D5C8C29F17D8,If school can offer options to students to finish school at home is great because they want students can learn and give them more opportunities. Students can be more benefit if they attend to school and they can learn more than to did at home. Also there are many students cant come to school because they have a job and they have to did school at home. Students are not that much of prepare if they did school at home. If students could attend to school it can be great for them to be more able to did more prepared them for the future. Also that can get opportunities if they attend to school and good reviews from teachers. If students attend to school there are more ways to learn. Also students can be more able to ask more question to teachers. If they did classes from home that are not able to ask a lot of question and they cant met friend who can be a big help for them. If you attend to school also teachers can prepared you more and they talk to you if you did wrong in classes. All teachers in school i believe that they can see your capacity or level that you are and at home they just give you work and they didnt know anything about the student. The teacher at school can see the way that you better learn and they can work with the student to dont fell classes because the know you better if you go to school. Home school is a great idea for people that cant come to school. In the world are students that cant attend to a school because they have a job or others problems to go to school. In the world is not only one single reason to dont attend to school. Many of the students that cant attend to school in the United States of America is because they work and this work cant give opportunity to attend to school. Sometimes they dont attend to school because is hard to work and wake up in the mornings to go to school. They also many times prefer to do school at home because they maybe have physical problems and they feel better if they did at home. Many students cant come to school but if they did at home this shows that they are planing to graduate even if they dont receive a good chance to learn more. Students at home are not learning what they can learn in school. They are not very prepared if they did school at home because sometimes teachers give activities with friends and students can learn from that activities or presentations of projects that the whole class did it. School also you can practice more if you are learning and at home you cant practice what you learn. If you are learning English and you did school at home if they speak other language that is not English you cant practice it. If you did school at home there are also many distractions that you cant concentrate and if you are not concentrated in what your working on you are not going to understand what you are doing. If you are in a classroom teachers make sure that you are concentrated in your own work and they also make sure that you are doing right that why students who attend to schools can be more prepared than students who did school at home. In conclusion if you have time and the opportunity to attend to school you should do it because you will learn and get more opportunities. If you cant attend to a school and you are doing school at home you must concentrated in your work and dont get distracted. Also if you are receiving school at home you must find some one who you can work with to practice. The opportunity that many school offer is a great idea. School wants to students can complete their dreams even if they cant assist to a school. But the schools are giving opportunities to finish at home and must students should appreciate that because school is thinking about the future of the society. In fact school programs are working for people who really want to have opportunities and make their dreams true.,6,6,6,6,4,7,2981,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out. Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didnt know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area. In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not. Why because, I believe we accomplish more if we are doing something and working on it because it might get you somewhere in life or better you future and help you in the long run.

My second reason is students prefer good food than healthier food the taste nasty. In addition, mostly all students would prefer to eat regular food the is healthier. However,it doesnt have nothing to do with your body if you dont want to be fat because of the food you received, thats because you dont care about your body. Students will have to start worrying about their body not about the food they eat. My last reason is about the benefits of receiving healthier school menu at school.

I think that churchills is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure. Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Lets say that student that goes to school that they dont want to succeeded in there education. That they dont want there education for college or a university if they dont succeeded . Another example is if you are not succeeding then you cant do something just as outcome. Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise. Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They dont want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school.

348,2354,47261D6E0F08,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?. We accomplish excellent grades at school by studying , at sports by practicing everyday and never giving up to become an amazing player, and at work by learning and giving a lot of effort to realize our goals. First of all, students stay after school or ask for a raise pass to study more about the subject they have a test or quiz. In the actuality, there is a lot of schools from South America like Peru, Chile, Bolivia, etc. that do not have after school or raise pass for students to study more. Some students have to pay approximate 30 dollars per hour for a personal teacher to help them at home. Students from South America do not have the facility to study with their teachers without paying for extra classes. Another example, when I came to United States, there was a day that I had an important test, and I did not know nothing about the topic. So, I stayed after school with my teacher, and we practiced a lot. When I took the test, I answered all the questions without problem. The next day, my teacher gave me back the test and I was the highest grade of the class. That made me stayed more often at school with my teachers to study different classes. Furthermore, to get good grades, students have to do homework, projects, and participate a lot in class. Secondly, it is important for people that want to get better at sports to practice everyday to become an excellent player. Additionally, people success in sports, when they never give up and try to learn by their mistakes. When I was in Generic_City, at school I was part of a volleyball team, and we played against another school. That day, I was not ready to play with the other school. My team lost the game because I did not played good. I did not want to play anymore, because I was scared of losing again. But I did not give up because I was fascinated with this sport and I kept practicing and becoming better at volleyball. I know that the best way to success at sports is practicing all the time, and never give up in something that you love. I learned that if I stayed in inactivity, and do not practice, I would never become a good player in volleyball. Finally, people accomplish at work when they do new projects to grow the company each day. Another reason is, people have to be responsible with their duties at work. Besides, if you want to get a higher level position, then you can do it by learning more about your job and showing your effort and hard working everyday. In this days, is hard to get a good and stable job because it requires effort and knowledge, but being active and always doing something to make a wonderful work will let you find an amazing job. By the other hand, being idle can give you bad consequences like, you can be fired, never find a job or never be successful in life. I am sure that most people accomplish more when they study at school to get good grades, at sport when they practice and believe in themselves to become an extraordinary player, and at work when they learn and give a lot of effort to fulfill their goals.

Like they shouldnt disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that cant help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if its little people sometimes dont ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help. Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. They think that they cant learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... but the point is dont settle for okay do more. We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is a true fact and you should try to be a better human or person in life and become someone that people can look up too.",5,6,6,6,6,5,2927,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
350,2501,D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back! Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard. First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate. Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong. Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up. In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for. Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",7,6,6,6,6,4,2921,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

People go to parks to have fun and able to enjoy their time with their loved ones. They go to a park to spend their time outdoors. Community parks, state parks, and national parks provide a wide variety of interesting activities like enjoying the outdoors playing sports, kids can have fun playing, and you can also hangout with your friends. Firstly, any parks has a lot of interesting activities that everyone can have fun and enjoy themselves, therefore they make sure that they have a lot of choices to do for example, you live near by the neighborhood park and the weather outside is beautiful, so you decide to call your friends and tell them to meet you at the park, so you guys can enjoy the weather while playing sports outdoor. Secondly, parks is always a good place to bring children to have fun, enjoy themselves, and let them be free. Bringing your kids to the park is always a good choice therefore, they can go to the swings, sea saw, slides, and they can also go run around or you can also bring them to a amusement park where they can go on many rides. For example, Generic_Name is bringing her daughter and son to a water park, where the kids could enjoy themselves by going on a water slides or go swimming around the pool. Lastly, park is the best place to go and hangout with your friends, where you can all talk freely, have fun, goof around, and mess around with.

352,2039,9E49399B42B4,"Some people belive that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art clases. Should students be required to take a class in arts, or should such clases be electives? I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. students should take these clases because theyre part of our daily activity. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take. I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances. Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them. Well its true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they dont know how to let them out. Probaly through arts, music, or even drama theyll be able to express them out to the world. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students. For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. I believe those people didnt just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life. In summary, music, arts, and drama should be required for students to take, and such clases shouldnt be electives in school or for students.",7,7,6,5,5,6,2110,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
353,1897,E7EBDBDD703F,"Do curfews keep teenagers from getting into trouble? The city council is still currently debating on either adopting the curfew to be at 10 p. m. during the week days or at midnight on the weekends. If teenagers were to be out after the hours selected, it would be considered breaking the law. The laws are choosen for many reasons, even if we dont agree with most of them; we have to obey the laws. I believe the city council should adopt the cerfew for the minnors. When it comes to under age people in this world we have to be more conserned for their safety, it is best to have curfews. We should consider all the dangerous things going on in this world. Have you considered all the things that could happen when your child is out? There is many dangerous things going on in this world. Im not saying something will happen but honestly nowadays anything could happen. Without an adults care vision many things could occur. Many minnors are being killed or harmed for reasons we dont know. A curfew is one way from preventing those things from happening to your children. Even though a curfew at midnight on a weekend could still be dangerous; it is our responsability to teach the minnors from right to wrong. If we get them to understand why it is important to have a curfew they would be exrta careful. Theres a high possability they wont want to listen about their curfew; I can speak for myself I would want to spend more time with my friends there was a few times I didnt listen to my mom. I relized how much my safety ment to my mother and how worried she would be when i would be out late. Have you heard about what happened to Generic_Name in New York? He was such a good child. His mother talk about how he loved hanging out with his nephews and family. She said he wouldnt go out with friends, he would always be home. He was very close to his sister, theyd always be together. Generic_Name had good grades in school, he would never get into trouble at all. The reason I bring his story life into this essay is because he was killed a few blocks away from is house, outside a little food market. Im not so sure about the time but it was after dark. It was a group of guys who saw him, dragged him out the market and stabbed him under his arm. He tryed asking for help but no one would help him; he tryed getting to a hospital by foot unfortunaly Generic_Name didnt make it and died on the sidewalk. Those guy were caught a few months later and said they confused him with another guy. Generic_Name had no fault in any of it,he didnt deserve it. Maybe if he would of wanted for the next day or if his mom would of took him things could of happened diffrently. My point is leaving your house alone isnt so safe, when your with your parents it goes completey different. Some people might think they would give the freedom they wanted as a child to there children. They might think there isnt a problem with them going out when ever theyd like and dont think they need a curfew. Everyone wants to enjoy their life and live it fully. Enjoying life doent have to be passed your curfew, theres more to see during the day. Yes, you might trust your child so much you believe its okay for them to leave but do you believe in the other people with your child being out in pulic? During day is much more safe then at night time when its dark. One reason being is because of how many peolpe are out during the day. You could scream for help, run or give signs of being in danger. At night everyone is sleeping, and barely anyone is around. In conclusion, the city council should think about the things going on in this world and do whats best for the teenagers, which is to have a curfew. Teenagers can still have their freedom and enjoy every bit of their lifes with curfews. I think it would be for the best; everyone would be safe in that way. Mostly everyone can agree that their minnors safety is important. Curfews would also keep teenagers from getting into trouble.

354,3818,E060D90D6CB9,Dear Principal I dont agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress. If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishments in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything. If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldnt have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea. I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future. Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me. I wouldnt like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note.

355,1258,67E711AF87A2,"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful. Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at. Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future. Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me. When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better youll get. When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you dont go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything. Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you dont go beyond from where you are at. Its good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow. ",6,6,5,7,6,5,1349,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
356,3060,8E64BE4119C3,"Schools offer different options of schooling, they have is Online School , Public School , Private School and also Video Conferencing . However taking classes from home wouldnt benefit students the same way Public School would benefit them due to the fact; Some students are visual learners, Students wouldnt have a big social life outside of their home , Students can slack on their own education an have no motivation and also they could be relying on Google answers when they dont understand the material. Students have different methods to remembering a material they have learned. Everyone isnt the same, Everyone has their own different techniques; Some people may be visual learners, They need someone to be speaking to them explaining step by step and some students just like peace and quite to figure it out on their own. Personally I am a visual learner for every subject, I would need my teachers to give examples and to go over everything to me step by step to learn the material the teacher is teaching. My classmate, Generic_Name has a different opinion, Generic_Name needs a quite place to concentrate and to think about his work rather than a teacher talking the whole class period. In Elementary , Middle school and High school they plan a lot of activities for the kids. Schools have dances, concerts and even field trips being home schooled you wouldnt be able to enjoy none of the fun activities the school would have planned for your classmates. Being home schooled you wouldnt have that "" high school experience "" everyone claims they love so much and would do anything to go back too. Being home school would also effect your social life for the real world. In school they might not have a class for communication but going to a Public schools does teach you how to speak up and communicate with other people you dont know and that would really be beneficial for the real world after school when you go into your career. On the weekend I personally hate doing homework, I like to think of my home as a lazy environment for myself rather than another school place. I think if kids were to be home schooled they wouldnt be able to concentrate at home the whole time they are supposed to. There would be no consequences for the student as if when they arent paying attention or just on their phones the whole time. There would be no teachers or administrators to be motivating the student to get to work, be on time or even get youre grades up. Being home schooled and doing online school they would start getting on the wrong track after some time. If my house for me was a school environment i would procrastinate my school work so much like saying "" ill do it in 15 minutes "" "" ill do it the next 15 minutes "" and so on to the point i forgot because i have no motivation for my work. Having no teachers or administrator around it would be easy to cheat. not understanding the material and not being able to ask questions your last resort is to cheat for answer. Students will find the answers then think they have a easy way out of online school by relying on Google answers. Students can also pay someone to be doing their work for them and manipulate other kids to agree and do the work for them. Students attending online school or homeschooling have a lot of ways to cheat for their classwork. I disagree that home school or online school would be beneficial for students because they wouldnt be able to learn and understand everything and to being able to ask questions, Students wouldnt have a social life outside of their home and not be prepared to communicate with people outside in the real world, Students wouldt have any motivation for their school work and start slacking off and lastly they can find easy ways to get out of their own work and having it done without them actually doing any work.

357,2032,10ECA491D66C,"I disagree that someone can change you. First of all nobody can change the person you are from the beggining. Second of all no body can tell you how to be or what to do either even if your married or single. Third of all you have to be who you are you dont need to pleasure no body in this world but yourself. You have to be proud for who you are and what you are doing in order to be doing good in your ways of life. To begin with I disagree that someone could change. One because thats for you to decide if you wanna be the way you want to be. You cant change for anybody to accomplish whatever you want. If you want to change youll have to change on you know nobody can that for you. For example when I was a freshmen in high school I used to like skipping my classes all the time. I never went to my classes I liked being around my friends most of the time. My grades drops from 100 to 50 real fast. I didnt realize friends can make you go the down road. I felt like I did not care in the moment but then I realized all those friends were not real friends at the end. Nobody is going to help you get you stuff together, your grades, your education. I believe you have to always be your self in order to progress and success in your own life. Secondly people say that when you get married your suppose to be someone else that your suppose to cook at all times, do laundry for you partner and yourself, I believe that is not correct. I believe that you can still be who you are even if your with someone or not. You dont nessecarly have to be someone your not in order to make others happy. Your friends, your boyfriend or girlfriend are not going to give you a High school diploma, an apartment, a car, and food. You have to get that on your own you have to be happy the way you are. If you are a lazy person, crazy person, dramatic person, you can be how ever you want to be. You do not have to change to make the rest happy. For example I do not like being around friends anymore, I do not like drama at all that is just me I learned from my experience that no body is going to be there for you on your rough times and it is not worth changing for no body ever. Lastly I believe you have to be who you are and be yourself in order to success and follow your goals. Being your self is one of the best things there could be. You do not need to care if someone judges you. You do not need to be worried about anything but trying to accomplish your goals, your dreams and a better life style. You have to have a good character in order to achieve everything you want and especially being positive to yourself. Never let others try to change who you are or what you want to be always go by what you want and do not question your self. You have to be happy by the way you are and not think about how the rest want to see you. For example when I used to skip class in freshmen year in high school my friends wanted me to be like them they wanted me to skip at all times and just hang out in them mall or park. I realized one day I want to get somewhere in life I want to graduate on time, I want to have a good job, I want something different for my self. I realized I was doing my self wrong so I stop completly and started of my sophomore year fresh and different. I began to see the difference. My friends thought I changed and I did because I did not want to stay back with them I wanted to move on forward with my self and goals I had. This was my experience and ever since I realized being your self is a big worth anyone has. This is my opinion on why I disagree that you do not need to change for anybody. You always have to remain being the way you are and never let no one change the character you are just to make them feel happy. Even if you are with friends, boyfriend or girlfriend you do not have to change the way you are for them. Always be proud of the person you are too.

358,3382,54AC60510DC3,"Dear Districts School: I am writing to express my support for the proposal to require that students can finish high school in three years. I am in favor of this proposal for two reasons. One reason I am in favor that students can finish high school in three years is because some students they dont be able to take elective class and they dont have to waste their time to take another class. Most students can have more time to think and choose what career they want to continue to study. Since, they would like to go to the college and finish their career and get better job in their future. Another reason I am in favor of this offer is because students can have their opportunity to start to work more and save their money to continue to study. However, some students they dont have family or helper that can help to them to continue to study. Although, students need to work hard to graduate more early, but they have to keep this opportunity that this programs offer for them. Therefore, because this programs offer opportunity for students that want to finish their high school more early and if they want to continue to study they can take their time to work.

359,2109,B1AFACE6704E,"I agree with Michelangelos statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilties further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life. Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilites. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses: honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want; yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learnt so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits. Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self esteem. With a higher self-esteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emmits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life. In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelos statement. Setting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal.

360,2886,AB86BAABBF68,"Its a good idea for students to graduate of three years of high school instead of taking for years, i think if they have already passed their classes then they would not have to take elective classes and they might be able to graduate early, but if they need more then seven classes then they might do not be able to graduate and they will have to come during summer to complete their classes that they need to pass. For example if they are still missing some of the work they had to complete at the end of the year they would have to come during summer school or maybe take more classes then what they were allow to be taking. If they need to complete more work they might come during summer break, i think it would be good if you have all your classes that you need in order to graduate since when you come to ninth grade, so at the end of high school you might just come to skool just for maybe two classes and it would be better for you becase you need to pass all your classes either way in order to graduate. and you are assigned with seven SOL and one for english actually you have to be able to pass all the work that youre assigned you must complete all these before you go to the 12th grade, because if you dont complete these assignments before thatnthen you will strugle with these at the end of the senior year of high school, but if you complete all your work that means that you are ready to graduate. For example i am taking four classes that i need to graduate, but i am taking three elective classes because i wanted to learn more, and i did not want to go home early, so i told my counselour i wanted to get three more classes, but it is because i took all the classes i needed to take during the freshman, sophomore and junior year, so now that i am in twelve grade i just have to take just four main classes with are the ones i need in order to graduate. Even tho it would have been a good idea to come in summer because i can learn more, but also would not be a good idea because then i would not be able to graduate on time, or mostly like i would have to come to turn in the work i did not finish during school year, and that would b bad because i want to graduate on time just like the other people that passed all theur classes so i need to put that effort and see or talk with the teacher and ask them what do ni need in order to pass all my classes if i am missing some work i have to turn it in. I want to complete all the work due on time because if i do not turn in the work i am assigned to do then that would affect my grades and that will take me away from graduation, wich i have been waiting for since ninth grade, So i think it is good to complete your work in class, or if you have homework assigned then we must complete it, or like sometimes the teachers put some work in google classroom with dates due, so we must turn the work on time and complete all of it, becase if we do not do it our grades are going to go down and that means we will not be passing the classes that we need to pass and that will not let us walk in the stage We must complete all the work, if we do complete all that is assigned then we will be good and would not have to worry about our grades because the grades will be good too, that is why i say that we need to complete the work and sometimes pay attention to what the teacher is explaining that helps us to understand and make the work easy, but if we do not pay attention, at the end of the day or at the end of the class we will have problems with the understanding of the theme we have studied in class because we did not pay attention in class while the teacher was explaining. One of the examples of not paying attention in class is, what is going to come next like we are going to get very bad grades, so we must do all the work listen while someone is giving instructions because that way we would not have problems with anything and when the test comes up we are going to be prepared to take it and get high grades, because we already studied and if we review our work before we turn it in and make sure everything is good and in order so we would get a good grades. So other reason why we get good grades is if we come to school everyday because if we miss more then ten days we will get suspended and that will mess up your grades because you are abnsent and you will not be able to see or work in the class wich is better because if you do not come to school for couple of weeks then you will not know when you come back to school, you will be lost because you have already missed some of the work we already did while you was not here, so for me i rather coming to shool even though i am sick or something because otherwise i will bring my grades down and one missing day of school will make all my work come down or bring all my classes down because i have been absent and when i come back to school i would not know what to do. It is good to keep your grades up and stay them in the same level because that will help ypu tp graduate, so one of my examples is if i come to school and complete all my work, then i do not have to worry about my grades, but ut is not only about your grades or what you do in class is also about what we get in the test and that will be product of the work and effort we put in class if we did good in our notes or study guides that means we will be great in the test too because it is the same that we learn in class it is all the same what will come in the test, so we need to stay focused and ask for help the teacher if we do not understand what we are doing in class. The teachers are able to help in anything we want, well if it is about the classwork because sometimes we do not understand at all but we can review work and try the best for the next class, we always need to make sure our work is complete before we turn it in because if you have a small mistake that will bring your grades down too and we will not pass our classes and make sure complete everything, in order to graduate.",7,8,6,8,6,6,2298,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

363,1711,2D63639F997F,"Is it having a possitive attitude the key to succes in life? If someone would ask me if a possitive attitude is the key to be succesful in life. I honesty would agree with them. Because in a big part of life everyone is going to have to deal with ups and downs, Some more than others but everyone have to go through something bad for something good to happend. everyone have to fight for what they want, and on that fight is going to be bad parts and good parts but if you stay possitive most of the time you are going to win the fight , accomplish what you were loooking for and be succesful, But if you arent just keep trying and be possitive everytime. Always have possitive thoughts a possitive attitude and keep trying, Get up over and over intuil you accomplish your dreams, Do not give up because if something i have learn is that if you give up and think negative, you would never be succesful and know what you are actually capleble of, Thats why a lot of people is just stock in the same place because they are scare for what is going to happen, Because they have more negative thoughts then positive ones, Thats making them not be succesful in life, thinking that they are better where they are and not where they can be. A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery. This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasnt there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wernt going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done. The whole time i was pissitive, I wasnt scare at all i didnt have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i coulnt wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive. And now i am makin almost $1,100 per week and im just 18 years old still bought my second car crash it fix it and sold it then I bought me a 2017 Subaru WRX STI and my life is just going better and better some down and ups but getting up no matter wha, always trying and giving bad moments a smile and always possitive because things always are going to hapend but thats how life is. I dont know where i would be right now if i had a bad attitude all the time, and negative thoughts, thanks god im still here alive. Hope you guys like it and remeber always possitive attitude.

364,1549,14ED79D68BC4,I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. Im agree with Emersons because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why cant try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am going to know what its feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how im supossively to grow if I never have try it before how I will know if I am good for it Ifor not I never try before. Example If I am a person who has a mastered in bussines and I am able to have my own company but Iam scared to try how I am supposively to grow If I dont try I will stay in the same place where I srtart because is does not matter what I am mastered fpr it if I dont try I f I dont take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends in our own personallity because there are person that they are already old but some times they regret their selfs because they never try somethint that they could try it when they were young but now is to late for them I think those kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you dont try is gonna stay in our lives forever and we wiil never are going to see that. Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different then others and always be beyond in everything. ,5,6,6,5,5,5,283,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

I think is bad because adding another half hour to takes time away from there family and it takes to be with there family. some children do not have time to see their family in the week days because there mom or dad comes home after they are going to sleep or before they go to school but maybe Fridays to Sundays is when they can see their family. Some students dont have time to say a few hours because some students have sports to do or they are going do something else at home or have to go see the doctor. If they add a half hour to the school system I think all most all of the student will not come to school half of the school year. I disagree to the school board adding a half hour to school each day. I been to school all year except when I have to go the doctor for cheek up that is the only time I miss school. I play sports so I do not have time say a little bet longer of school or I am not on the term anymore.

366,1777,7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day. Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with peoples attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults dont take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isnt easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through whats stop you from being happy. Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday. Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again. In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

367,3857,80C2ED8BE6A6,"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of students struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff youre interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home. I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so its more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When students get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if youre sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop youll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades. However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eyes. Also that its easier to cheat on tests and quizs in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosent know what your doing on.

Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between 5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life. Many students in high school work after school , I think this program can help they because they can continue working and they can sleep more , this can help they to have a better grades because they can sleep more because sometimes they have a bad grades because they dont have the time to do the homework and the study for the test . Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls dont want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when theyre pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because theyre to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes. For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they dont have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",6,5,5,4,4,4,613,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone.

Some people dont buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents arent like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, thats why some parents dont let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they dont care whats happens around them. Like my parents didnt want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didnt even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didnt have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they dont have money to eat and they cant help out their children with their eduaction. In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people dont speak your language youll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online.

Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes. Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesnt matter what kind of disease can be, it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu. In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",8,7,7,7,7,8,2011,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource. Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes. We are going to help the environment to keep it safe from the pollution, to make a better style life for the humans, and save resources for critical moments in the world. As you can see there are many resources what we could save, if we have adopt this plan. In this plan, there are many benefits but also disadvantages. For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier. In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this. We are going to understand that is necessary protect our resources, because they are indispensable to keep us alive and keep going with this life what we have in the twenty-one century.

In this paper i will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. should student consider their career pass at a young age,yes because when the student gets older and becomes a adult he or she wont have to have a boring and low paying job. Im am in the eleventh grade and I already know that i want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder. The class that am taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is JROTC. You may ask that is JROTC? JROTC is a class that teaches student about the United State Armed Forces. Another class that am taking in my school that will help me with my fucher career is Econ and Finals. Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but i like that class because i know that its going to help me with my fucher career. What if we dont start preparing are self for are fucher careers after high school well be loss, confused,and broke too. In my family i dont think anyone do what they wanted to do i high school . I remember my mom telling me that she wanted to become a Aries but she never became a Aries because in her old school they didt have art and she dropped out to have family. Working is something everyone have to do.

377,3619,03C9E7A15C42,I think that what Auther ralph waldo wrote i dont agree becuase he said that what you already masterd you will never grow i think that with the more you mastered the more you will know in life those things that you had masted are things that you want to do and get in life. you will understand more things like the more important thing like when you mastered drving one of the most important thing to master in life that is the first gole u want to master in life and when u do youy feel like you can do more thing once you have you get your drivers licens. Or even as a kid when you mastered a video game you want to keep going keep getting challeged on each part of the game and when you finished on you buy another one and it keeps going even when you die on the video game you still try to keep going on unless you get fusterated and mad and you just give up and quit. Unless you keep trying you master the video game. The things that i had mastered was the most importent one was driving its was hared for me just to get my permit and i guess it grow on me beacuase i want to do more in life i want to be able to help my family and do what i can for my sisters and brother and my mom. Like out of all the thing i had mastered i say that is one of the thing i want to do becuase be able to go to callege be some thing in life. so i say the more you master the more you grow and know as a person. the reason why i think that the more you master the more you grow its becuase out of all the things that i had gone throw i realised that as im getteing older more and more chaleges that i will have to master will come my way in the future thing that i will want to master. i say this is why they make kids go to school so they can learn more things so that we can be challged and master things as we go throw school so we can see the type of person that we want to be in life so that we can face challeges thats whay i say the more things we master the more we grow so that we can learn from those thing.,5,5,5,5,4,5,43,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

380,1633,38B60A8516C2,"I believe that having 3-4 weeks break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, sounds like a good idea. It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall. The days will be shorter since the school year is longer. I believe not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break. It will be easier for people to hold the information when they return in the fall. A large amount of people forget what they learn in school when they return from the 3 months of summer break. Everytime summer break comes I forget mostly all the information information I learned, it just leaves my head over those months. When we get 3-4 weeks over summer break, not all the information will leave. It will be easier for us students to not forget what we learned over the months. School days will be shorter since the school year is longer or we can have one weekday off and have school at a regular time. They can change it so students dont have to wake early in the morning. Some people cant wake up early and some people get off work late and have school the next day. Students can have one weekday off, like a Wensesday or Friday off. It will give them time to relax and stay focus on school. Since, the school days are shorter, they can have time to theirselfs and not be stressed. I believe not everyone has something to do over the three months of summer break. They might just do something for one month and for the another two months might not do anything. They might just stay inside and play video games all day and not read or not pick up a book the whole break. They might not even exercise all day. Students need to have something to do over the breaks, so they can keep learning. Sometime I believe its a bad idea. Students will stay a school the whole year until they gradute, and they need to spend time with their family. Some students dont really like school and they will get too stressed and breakdown over the year, so they need a long break from school. Students need time for theirselfs, so they dont stress as much. Students will stress over too much work and they have after school jobs, so they cant do their homework. Having 3-4 weeks of summer break, a longer winter, and a week off in the spring and fall is a great idea. It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall. School days will be shorter since school year is longer. Not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break.

381,3075,53D17839AAC0,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks with the limitation of human contact and can provide the use of less work and less communication. it could also be asked that whats the point of working here if theirs technology here ?. Most workers may ask that and will be furious with technology because of the fact that they will have less work and probably less hours of work, since technology is taking over their jobs. it could also be said that technology could be taking over some jobs that require less work, which could be bad for the job environment because that means less job opportunities for people. First, it could be rude to the staff that work their because of less human communication. How is it rude? Well think of it like this: someone is better than you at your job and you wanna be better, but you cant because the person youre going up against is a computer and knows mostly anything and everything on what to do in those situations. Most people may have to face the fact that you cant do anything about technology. Second, The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology will have negative effects on peoples lives because of the fact that technology will help most people in some cases, but most people wouldnt appreciate the help from technology because it could be taking over their jobs and have less human contact with others. But the fact is people should appreciate technology because of what theyre providing. Most people may not see it that way or feel like its helping them. In conclusion, I believe with the reasons I have provided that technology will have a negative effect because of the way theyre taking over most jobs and seeking happiness to people that enjoy it. People wouldnt like to admit the fact that technology is actually helping them and providing less work for them. Technology is actually seeking to steal most peoples jobs by doing their work for other people.

382,1461,ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasnt even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you dont understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think its better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they cant make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because its their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school dont matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.

384,919,E11139259D4E,"Students have enough hours of school already! I strongly disagree about the school board adding more hours to school every day. Im not telling you this just because Im a student, Im telling you this because It doesnt just affect me, It affects other students in many ways too! This could bring students really bad behaviors, because they get tired of being in the same place for a long period of time. This could bring students grades down too, because students do not work the same when they are tired. If they added more hours to school, students wouldnt have time to do their homework or to study for quizzes and tests. This idea of adding hours to school does not just affect students, it brings problems to the teachers and the school. Teachers have families and some of them have children of their own, this wouldnt let teachers to go home and pass time with their family. Another problem I see in this Its that some students have appointments, Just like me ! Sometimes I have to go to my orthodontist, and my appointments are always in the morning, I have to go there every month. I always miss two or three classes, and when I get there I have A bunch of work that I missed! If they dint add those hours to school I could ask my orthodontist to do my appointments in the afternoon. Sometimes students get sick, and if they miss one day of school they would have to do more work than the usual. This affects the school in many ways too! The school would have to pay more, because they would have to give the students more food than the usual. They would have to waste more money in paper, bathroom supplies and they would have to give the student a new agenda with more bathroom passes in it. the school would have to manage more conflicts and fights between the students. If they added one and a half hours to school they would create more car crashes and accidents in the roads, because the students would get out of school at the same time that elementary school students do, and then there would be a lot of school buses. Students wake up pretty early, at least thats what I do. If the school added more hours they would get more than tired, the student wouldnt even learn the lessons or the teacher wouldnt even teach the lessons right. As you can see I listed many ways that adding hours to school affects students,teachers and the school. I think the school board should rethink this new idea they came up with. i think that they should hear other students points of view. I think Im not the only student that thinks that this is not a good idea because it affects everyone. And some other students think different from others. In conclusion I think that the school board shouldnt add more hours of school because of the different consequences it gives to the students, teachers and the school. And it not just gets the students tired but they wouldnt learn the subjects like they normally do in class. Teachers are affected by this decision too, because they get more tired and they get mad at students easier. This could create big conflicts between people in school and it could bring the school more problems than the usual, like more fights and they would have to give students more breaks. So please School board, rethink this idea you came up with and hear other peoples points of view!!!. ",8,7,7,8,8,7,3216,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
385,1870,161E5C8A6719,"Studies has been showed that students that been committing to their dream career before entering high school would be most likely to get their career more successful than other students. However, itll be a stressful/pressure thing for students because they would have to achieve it faster than others. The issue of students committing to a career at a young age is a stressful, mental thing, should not be considered because students would be more stress, they would focus on their future career and not themselves and high school makes everyone change their minds. My firsts reason why students should not commit to their career at a young age is because they would be more stress throughout high school. Yes, high school seems like an easy place to stick to your future career but at the same time its really not. If you commit to your career throughout high school, yourre more likely to be stress because you feel like okay if i do this ill achieve faster but not at the same time if i do this i wont be achieving. So technically you just put yourself in a position that you really cant get yourself out of. Youre focus on one thing that in your other classes its hard to think or studied about. Yes, committing is easy but its not. Itss high school the place where your education change you. You would probably change your mind no time soon. Therefore, dont put yourself in the position to be stress. Pressure is a main key to everything nowadays because its ""fun"". However, it is not. Being put on pressure is the most hardest thing to be in because you feel like you have to do it to make someone or somebody proud. Like in this case your future career. You feel like youre pressure because you want to make your parents, teacher, your school admins proud and know that you can really commit to things. As days or weeks goes on, the pressure level goes up and up and when that goes up you kinda get depressed, sad and not yourself because you are doing this for them and not you. High school changes everyone mind. As soon as, you walk into high school its not the typically high school movie you think. It is place where students and teachers minding their selves and doing their know things. Middle school vs. High school are two different place. The classes are harder, high school have many many electives to pick from so like of course you are going to change so like why would you want to stick to your career at a young age when your havent taken those other classes. Like your never know what you actually like when you have tried taken those classes. In my personal opinion i would not commit to career at a young age. i learned from experiences and from other. Take the classes that you like in high and if you like keep moving on. If not, move to a different one. What your see on TV is not want you see in reality. So again in my opinion Everyone is different, you are different. career is just a word. Dont push yourself at a young age.

Is the same thing as school. Some students is in Community service. First reason, that Community service is important because the mayor of the city will be proud. Some people say What a mess is here!. The community service is come for help. When you left trash then later it will smell bad. Some people hated when this happened. Please dont leave thrash on the floor put it in the trash can. Second reason is that when theres a event the people who work there have to clean up before the event starts. Some people think that takes too much time away but no. They just want to help people and the community. In school is the same thing friends doesnt want to help and some to. Last reason is that theres too much to clean up and during the night. Janitors need to clean up during the night because when the next day comes it will be clean and neat. Some people clean up their stuff alone and sometimes together. I think t",6,5,6,5,4,6,3491,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
391,1448,6642E181B08D,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else. no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework. In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people) they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it. Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer. I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do ) to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue. and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter. In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.",6,5,6,6,4,4,1334,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

393,2240,E1CAFEEB258E,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson, haves kind of a point about the world trying to make you something else. My point of view is that we all have choices we make to better our selves to make us better people in the world but some of the choices we make as humans can lead us to a wrong path. We as people have to set goals for the future and plan ahead to accomplish them. One thing i learn while being incarcerated you got to value yourself more than you value others, if you dont value yourself whats the point for setting up goals if all they going to do is collect dust. Everybody haves different opinions some people might think the world is at fault for the choices they make and thats not true, people blame others when they know their in the wrong or done something wrong than try to say its the other persons fault. Ill say is, with everything going on in the world we got to get together and help each other more and come together as a team NO! more as a family, when one of us fall down we lift each other up, if one of us gets hurt we heal each other. Theres got to be things we can do, hard times dont last forever at these moments we got to remember how far we come from hard times when things didnt look good for us. The world can try to charge you, it can try to break you, it can throw you to the side but the goals you set up and the people by your side will help you complete the dreams and goals you wish about.",5,6,6,6,5,5,3231,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they dont really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students. They dont have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", thats not the life that people want and thats not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders. The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to. In my conclusion: its better to take things with calm and peace, not to take it to fast, we still have bunch of time to decide whats really matter and whats matter to us.",6,6,6,6,6,5,1405,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
395,3671,6ACB38C6577C,"Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them. A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that theyll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired. In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.",7,6,7,6,7,5,1387,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body cant make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he cant do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school. Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you dont have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you cant find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesnt have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor. Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me. Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses. Some students, need go school for the understand better.

Parents have to give support their child with the decision to commit a careeer at a young age, because thats what they want; dont be desagree with them because the only thing that they want is to be independent and lot of mothers dont let their childs be an adult; farthermore, mothers have to impulse their child to make their own decisions and let them learn from their mistakes.

The ocean is an amazing place and is full of magnificent creatures. i would love to swim with sea life and help them in any way i can. if i see an animals caught in a net. I would try and save it. If there were animals in a bad situation such as injured, harmed, caught. I would help it. so many animals are killed every year. either for clothes, food, wild fire, pollution, loss of habitat, etc. over 700,000 thousand animals are killed every year. that includes sea life and land life. So many animals that are endangered like the black rhino. the great white shark, etc just from poaching. sharks are hunted for their fins and then just tossed back into the ocean to die. same goes for the black rhino. they are hunted for there horns and then just left to die. i want to accomplish saving some animals when i grow up. In the ocean coral reefs are dyeing because of people and habitat distraction. some people think that coral reefs are just rocks growing out of other rocks but they are actually animals and they are living and breathing just like us. maybe they dont have noses like us they are animals and they should be treated like animals. in ten years we would have lost 100% of our coral reefs.

Sea life dies from plastic by getting stuck in it or eating since its not biodegradable.

Most of the people and analysts have got the conclusion that working in groups could be more beneficial. A factor the support this idea it is because you get to have different thoughts, ideas and ways to see the life that can help you in bad situations. For example, if you are planning either something as big as a school event, or something as simple as a classroom presentation, there is occasions when you run out of ideas. You can count in the group. They are going to be there giving diverse solutions to the problem, otherwise, by yourself you could be struggling like if you are in road with no exit. Working in a group sometimes can make you relax, laugh and bring positivism, even in challenging moments or when you are facing stress. Every time you have to work in this way, you do not spend boring moments. There will be always something to talk about. You and your team would be saving memories that in a future would be a moment of laugh. Another fact about working in group is that you get to finish the work in a faster. More people working in the a series of things in a quickly way than just one, makes a big difference. It will give space to the creativity, where you can practice more, give details to the work or even do new creations. Because you are working in a team you do not focus only in ""I"" you open your mind and start thinking in ""we"". This is going to be useful in the future, when you go out to the real world. Working with other people, you have to deal with different personalities and thoughts. The team working abilities are going to be place in your mind. When as a team all your tasks are completed you will find a great euphoria in the results. It is going to make everyone proud of themselves and also it is going to be a method to keep pushing them up and never give up. Sometimes when you get to work in a group it might sound or seem a difficult task. But instead, you learned new experiences and new abilities. It become a helpful tool to develop character and to grow as a person. You have to learn how to speak with the people and how to tell your ideas in a clear manner.

I disagree because it can be very tiring to stay school more longer, it can change your mood of being in school, and you may want to got out with friends or family. The First reason, Is because if we stay more longer in school you are gonna get more tired. If you get tired in school you are not gonna have more energy to go outside and entertain yourself. And you would just go home and sleep all day long. However, if we dont extend the school hours, we wont be as tired, and we would have energy to go outside. The Second reason, Is that if we stay longer in school it can change the way you are. Staying in school longer can change your mood because you wont be as happy. Because you would have to stay in school longer. Also you might have teachers you dont really like and you would have to see them longer. However, it doesnt have to be that way, if we dont extend the school hours. The Final reason, Is that you woudnt have time to spend with your friends or family. Because most of that time you would be in school. ANd spending time with friends/family is the most important thing in life and school shouldnt take all the space froem your life.

To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they wouldnt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better. To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays dont really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future its always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and dont be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldnt give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored. Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.

407,2042,F1883C3A8C1E,It has been said that having a positive attitude is the key to success life. I agree but at the same time i disagree. First being positive can bring success in life we so many great people who found the key to success in being positive like Micheal Jordan. He was cut from his varsity basketball team but him being positive and putting in work help he found the key to success in his life. Next my second reason i think being positive can be the key to success is. Da Baby he was always told we wasnt every going to be anything but had stayed humble and positive and keep his head up and now he is one of the top rappers of are time now. he has multiple gold and platinum records and he has millions of fans and followers he has people who want to see him because he stayed positive and found his key to success. last i disagree because having a positive attitude isnt always the key to success because when the people out in war doesnt have a positive attitude because they have to be ready for the enemy and i think you wouldnt want to have a positive mind set in that predicament. In conclusion being positive can sometimes be the key to life and sometimes not having a positive attitude can still be the key to life.,5,5,5,5,4,6,3570,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Doing just one thing, they never try something new they mind be thought the in the future wouldbe use less or they just dont feel like they actully need it but if you get more experiences you will grow as a person and besed on experiences too. For example. When you start growing u learn a lot of things that make you a better person. You know that there is a person that want to learn new things, even if hes young but you know things like that adults know that make you be a older person. In the way that you know things that persons that have you same age not , but you know that you have some other responsabilities, because based on what you know you life have to about on that things that you know or you make or that things that you learn. For example, you go to school that is a place where you learn and where you been intul you graduate because if you know more you have more oportunities to be succecful, and im agree on his coment why? let told you the reason. A lot of people never try new things like if you are a teacher and after like 5 years you dont feel like to teach more. you can try to be something else that help you to grow more based on experiences because if you try more things like other jobs or try to study something else like gona be rich on experience because many people sometimes get stuck on one thing but everything in this world have a solution but to get your goals is not a easy thing you have to sacrifed many things that you love. For example your hoobies or your family or other events, but at the end of the day you have everything you ever wish becuse you deservet and you work so hard to get it. And you start see the succes that you have. You would see that all you did to get there was correct and that make you grow because you have more experience. Nothing is inpossible. For example if you are the owner of a little restaurant and you want to your restaurant grow more, and more but you remenber that you study bussines and also you work for a restaurant and on that restaurant you were a manager, so you have the experience and if you know how spend money and you make a good marketing plan you can be succesfull and you will growing as a person and as experiences. In addition I think hes right becuase how I been saying if you know more you have experience and you can a have better jobs and that way you growing you have oportunities more chances to be a better on your life and unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

410,2380,D9469EFAE287,"Im going to start explaining and giving my opinion, Technology is one of the main reasons, why the world is changing and accommodating with the necessities that the person have, for example: we live in a community that if everything is easier is better, few years ago people had to walk hours or days to go some where, on this days the transport is a lot easier because the technology had increased, you can use or have your own car or you, can take the public transport and go everywhere with out problems and if you want to go to another country you can! because the air lines exist now, and you can fly to go to the country you like. So technology have a positive effect because is helping us to make our daily necessities at home or everywhere better, a reason why i think that is because the future of the students is going to be with more opportunities to learn what they like, with out saying excuses, the help of others is not going to be that necessary with technology in your hands; no body have to advocate for you with your problems and decisions. Technology is going to be increasing, For example years ago you could not talk to your family or friends if they were too far away from you, in that edge the only thing you could do was write a letter and send it through mail and then the people who was waiting for it has to wait like one or two months; for have that note, but all that had changed too, When the telephone was invented people start buying and using, that invent, for the public in general the telephone start to be necessary for the people for emergencies like call the ambulance or call the police in case that something dangerous could be happen; years before, the history of the telephone became with new ideas like you can not just call with the telephone because is has be made it smart you can take pictures play read book and more, today the telephone have a drastic change is nothing like the old phone is something different. technology had changed our way to communicate and transport and a lot more.",7,6,7,7,6,6,3040,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
411,2152,58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and wont even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either. My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think its really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and its shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them. I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that wont do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do whats best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it. Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and thats another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea. Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their lifes for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",7,7,7,8,8,7,1144,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
412,2351,745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know whats best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,6,6,7,7,6,6,1512,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
413,3369,F78366DD5A31,"The decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their family because, students know how to mange their time, families would remind or help out, and teachers give students time to finish or study assignments. As a senior in high school, I attend to many activities after school and still have plenty of time to complete assignments. I believe, that managing time is key on getting everything done on time. In the past, I have asked teachers on how I could mange my time and still have time to complete assignments. After having that conversation, I had improved my grades and also had time for activities. Thats why I think managing time is a good way to complete school work and finish any outside activities. If my family were to see me go out a lot or come back late from any activity without completing my work, they would talk to me and find a way to help me out. After that, they would see my grades and check for any late assignments because, there is no family that would like for their son/daughter to have bad grades in school. Many students would not pay attention on their grades and go outside thinking that they have nothing due for any classes. Although, thats when families come in and remind their child that they have assignments to complete before they go outside. This is why families are good reminders and helpers on getting good grades. Teachers in high school give students enough time to complete assignments or study during class. I tend to complete it during class because I like to go home and not worry about any school work. Overtime if a student does not finish their homework, teachers tend to say that they gave us time to complete it during class. However, I do not make that same mistake and finish my work during class, so that the teacher would not bother me. That is why taking advantage on finishing working during class, is a good why to have time for any outside activity. That is why schools should not control any student, and regarding extracurricular involment shall be left to students and their families.

I believe the appropriate use of technology does not divide, or limit human contact. If we give a good use to it, we will have great benefits. Besides, technology improves communication skills, helps parents, and facilitate jobs. Research has proved that technology has been a useful tool for communication skills. This is shown in the facility that we have now at making a call, or video call to another country. It has improve communication for people who are speechless, defeat or just shy. All of them has problem at talking or listening, but with technology this is getting over. And they are interacting in certain way with other people. To sum up, technology is improving communication in different ways. Parents always have many things to do. Passing time with their children is not easy; however, technology is making easier it. Now parents can work from home; this is giving them the opportunities to share more time in family. Also, for parents that work out new machines are helping them to finish quickly. Although, new phones schedule appointments and others for them, in order to be organize. In resume technology is giving the opportunities to spend time in family to parents.

416,3793,840D73A3804A,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what youre gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because youre a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because youre more active, and youre more unique, than most people. My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then youre powerful already. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. People cant ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Hate on you, but dont let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then youre doing something great, if theyre not hating on you, then youre not doing anything really. My second reason is that youre a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by its neck, and just yank it, cause its yours. You gotta take over your life now. Dont wish, and wait. Start now, and dont let stuff handed to you. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you dont feel like it. You will be great, and youll thank yourself in the future. My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because youre more active, and youre more unique, than most people. Ah, yes nobody likes a person thats just ""normal"". I find that quite lame, and boring. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. For example: You wouldnt want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. You are more active, than just sitting down. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful. My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?

422,2435,053ACB9DFE74,If your having so much trouble in a problem you have just ask an adult or some freinds. It would be good to have more then one person. Because a freind could be fake and give bad edvise like drink alcohal to feel better or cut your self becuase you are depresed. Nothing of that is good so when a good freind comes to tell you advise they tell you good things. Another thing is that maybe somone could be lieng to you about somthing. and some people try to help but somtimes they make it worst by givving you bad edives. Like I said earlier somone might be lieng to you like for example he/she might say leave the house because your parents cause the problem. So you have to dectect that or els e you will get in seriuos problems. so i f you know that their is a fake freind trying to tell you lies say ok and leave. Another thing i said is that they probably give you the best edvise. What i mean about that is that they try to help you but they only make it worst like for example: your bf (boyfreind) breakes up with you and you cry for hours and he says ask him to be your bf again you will be ambaresed in front of everyone the last point i wanted to talk about is that more than one person is good to give you advise because some of them can not be halpfull some of them can be liars and some of them can be fake edvise,7,5,6,6,6,4,70,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
423,959,F3F4454A2E3B,"Most companies look for specific characteristics in potential employees. Some people think that companies shouldnt look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company. Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. But sometimes those people arent good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think Im a very good candidate because, Im good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally Im may not have much experience on this kind of work but Im a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job. One reason, I think I should be hired is that Im good working with people. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, Im always willing to help if anybody needs me Ill be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me. Another reason, is Im always willing to work extra hours if needed. I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours dont hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we cant give the workers that break because the company doesnt have enough people to cover that person. Thats why Im willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire. Finally, Im a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph Im willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me Ill do it at the best of my ability, it doesnt matter what it is Ill do it. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, Ill do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. Im always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent. As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. Im good working with people, Im willing work longer hours if needed, and Im a hard worker. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things Im able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job.

Although some might believe that identifying your career choice at a young age is good for the future. The reason behind this idea is, students are expected to identify a career bt hte time they enter high school, some good high schools helps the students, with the courses they taking, as a high school student they talk to their parents or counsellor about the career choice and what college to choose. In my opinion identifying your career choice as high school student. Because parents and counsellors looking forward to what career im having in the future. And identifying what is the best college for me to attend, because of my career. But the hard thing about this idea is that you got to study hard, worry about all the tests youll take in the future, and trying not to let your school and parents down.

The good benefits of it is that the student gets to have a three day weekend for the whole school year and more time to finish there homework or the work they missing to catch up with there grade for that class. The other disadvantages is if those other two was added the student is not going to pay attention and lose there focus on the lesson also there work or fall asleep in class. If i went to a school that had extra two hours I probable not pay any attention to my teacher or lose my focus and go to sleep till school finish. A other good benefit is that they can shorty the school year and make the holidays week longer or spring break longer.

427,2525,BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years? In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn: How to save up money for a better future How to have a better behavior You learn how to spell some stuff correctly How to write essays There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.",5,5,6,7,7,6,2532,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

429,3089,0A3964629F69,"Generic_Name My grandma, always said that being in a group gives you more things to talk about. The benefits of working a group is more beneficial because,more ideas, partisan,and some one you can talk to. Many calm that working alone will not share your ideas with other clearly, it better working in a group have fun and to talk to others. To begin the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because having more ideas. For example my sister, Generic_Name she loves sharing her ideas. Each ideas they share with they classmates. They can have have a example on what there writing about and have an idea on what there talking about. For example my Mom,is A fourth grad teacher she loves seeing others sharing it means a lot to her. She partners up the kids and so she, can see on thing the can come up with. However,having more ideas well help us share ans being thoughtfully to other in life. In addishly,the benefits of working with group is more benefice because, to pertipat in a class room. For example when i first stared middle school i didnt want ti partisan with no on. Because, i wanted to work bye my self. Later that week i made a Friend and, she intrdust me to the other class mats, we all disided to be together for this school project. Example my little brother Generic_Name ,he was shy to talk to others in the class room. I as an oldest sister, to if him they no need to be shy just talk to others and pertipat in class and get to know every one. that next day my brother was happy to with others. However,partisan is a good way to show others an example and make new friends Finely the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, having some one to talk to for example my friend Generic_Name, didnt have have nothing tot talk to for example my friend Generic_Name,didnt have nothing to think of .I was helping her on some thing we can together thinks of. I as a friend was there to listened to was she had to say. Example my other friend she wasnt at school because,her Grandpa, pasted away she misted on what we were working on. So i want to show her on the thinks she missed out. It helped her a lot. In concluss the benefits of working in a group is more beneficial because, more ideas, partisan, and some you can talk to.

430,1129,39524C93F4D4,"People will tell you that without doing something, youll never get what you want. I agree. Accomplishing something is a great feeling when you know youve done it because when you know you put in the time and effort for it and get a great result. It shows that the time you toke to make it was worth it. Sitting around, letting people hand you stuff will get you no where in life, because instead of you doing something, you wait for them to give it to you, not aware of what that person had to do to. What does it mean to accomplish something? To me accomplishing something is when you worked hard for what you did and youre satisfied with your result. That to me is accomplishing something. Whenever I set my mind to anything, I do whatever it takes to make it. For example, I had a championship finals in a week and I needed time to prepare my mind and body for the game. The time came to play the game and all I could think about was winning that trophy. We ended up winning, and I won what I was waiting to accomplish. I dont think I could have made it if I didnt make an dedicate my time to win the finals. Kids nowadays are spoiled by there parents to get whatever they want just by asking. I can understand that some parents care about what the needs of there own children, but I often see parents buy usless things for there kids and that can be a problem because when they know they can get these things that arent any use for them, they go asking for other stuff that they dont need. A solution to this problem can be when they are old enough to get a job, to get one so they can make money, so they can buy things for them selves. Instead of leaching on Mommy and Daddys money all the time. Getting a job shows that youre doing something to get what you want, for example, a house, a car, anything you can spend youre own money that you need. The effort you showed got to where you are and now you know you accomplished it. A person I know that has accomplished alot in his life is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a soccer athlete and was born in a small town in Portugal. Like others there, his family was really poor and couldnt afford him anything really. He was a trouble child in school and misbehaved when things didnt go his way. He was very talented in soccer though. He would go outside, find anything round and did whatever he would do to a real soccer ball. He was noticed by coaches when they would here a young kid scoring goals not any normal kid would. He moved to the capital of Portugal and would play for the towns Division one team. He never forgot his family back home. He would have made a ton of money to send back to his family and bought them a house in a much nicer and safer location. His goal was to be the best player in all of soccer. He worked in and out of practices to get better and play for a club that people would notice that he was. He was bought by one of the greatest teams in all of europe Real Madrid. He was the most highest paid athlete at the time and whenever he got his pay check, he would always use it for a good cause like, family, charity, etc. He would eventually be nominated for the best player award five times and would end up winning those times. He accomplished what he had dreamt of becoming, and I hope people could see his story and realize you cant just sit around and do nothing, you have to put in time and effort to get what you want. I can understand when people can get lazy and not do anything to accomplish anything. Not everyone is perfect. But sooner or later theyll realize that without doing something, you cant get what you want. Sometimes people are fortunate to recieve things just by asking, but do you want to live a life leaching off people? Letting them know ""oh this person cant live without me because I get him everything"" I know I wouldnt. I hope to accomplish here that, you have to make an effort in order to accomplish something.

431,2981,6C045F130B28,"Technology in todays life is, so advance that it has both positive and negative impact on peoples life. According to me, I think that technology has change peoples style of living. Technology at some point slow downs the physical growth or development of our body and it stops us from learning new things, But on the other hand it helps us to complete many task and save time. Modern technology has negative impact on peoples life. People can check out books, shop, and play games without moving form place and talking to anyone. This leads to no physical activity, which slow downs physical development of our body. In fact, there was a survey taken few days ago and it states that more then 45% of middle schoolers in U.S.A has to take some kind of vitamin medicine as the dont eat their lunch properly because they watch t. v or phone while taking lunch, 38% middle schoolers have glasses because of sitting in front of TV or using phone all the time, and more than 46% students are overweight or underweight as they dont do much physical activities. Secondly, technology stops us from learning new things. Technology helps people to complete new task in every day life, and then we get use to taking help from technology instead of trying it our self or learning it we get a habit of letting technology do our work. For example, if our mom not stopped us form spoon feeding then we would take it for granted and never learn how to eat our self. But, On the other hand technology helps us to complete many task and save time. Technology helps us from not being delayed, it complete task 50% more faster than us, and helps us to save 25% of more time. For example, Our group got an assignment to do on Monday and the deadline to submit it was on Friday, So if i would read books to find some info, it would take me at least 2 weeks to complete that assignment, but thanks to modern technology,I was able to finish it in 3 days. At last, I would like conclude that technology plays a major role in our day to day life. It has both type of impact negative and positive and it impacts on our life, but the main thing is ""how and when we use it"". Technology changes lifestyle of people and if we use it more it slow downs our physical growth and stop us from learning new thing, on the other it also completes our task easily and faster that us. So less use of technology gives us positive effects and more use of it gives us negative effects. ",8,6,7,8,6,6,1404,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
432,2455,82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling. Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people dont finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they cant reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country. Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there were more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand. Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldnt say a word because I didnt know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we were just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came. Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. ",6,7,8,7,7,7,1725,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

I disagree with Emersons statement, because you can keep growing by trying and trying hard on whatever you already know. However; when you try and keep trying somehting is when you grow up more and more each time. Additionaly, we grow more with stuff that we are good already, because we become more and more greatful. Primaly, we think that by trying what we already know, it makes us better each time. Generic_school made a survey to all seniors to get everyones opinion base on Unless you try to do something beyod what you have mastered, you will never grow. sevendy five percent of students desagree, they said that you learnd more and more of what ever you already know.

Peolple be adictive with their phones, They can be adictive with shopping online, and dont have communication with other people. The people is adictive with his phone or the game, in my opinion is bad because they just thinks in his self. For example, if someone need help he or she can help the person because, he or she are used the phone and sometimes mean, their phone or the game is more important that someone need help. That person can be a adult or a child. Sometimes we need to be more kind an have a good heart with other people. I know is you are woman, you always shop online that is the best thing make womans. but some of woman have addiction with shop online. For example, some of woman shop online and that good because you can be indepent and shop you own clothes, others shop a lot clothse and they have big addiction with shop online. I my opinion the person dont have communicate with other people, is a person dont that ispiration for his life or future. For exmaple, if that person never do something that motive or that is good for that person, literally he or she is one of more. In my conclusion, we nedd to be a ligth between that people is addictive in their phone. Because that bad for they life and their future. That was I agree, because technology is nor the best thing human created. ",6,5,6,6,5,5,2828,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
435,3631,AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that theyre more successful than you. Thats exactly why you shouldnt trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but dont put your 100% trust in them because its always that one person that you wouldnt expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldnt let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, dont to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that thats you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself. You shouldnt be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone theyre, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person theyre with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they cant accept who you are? Shouldnt you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how theyre acting towards you. Thats why I dont let people influence me in any way because you never know what that persons intentions. be your own person and dont ever be someone yourre not, and you should never change for someone just cause they dont like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see whos really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend dont respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go. My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and dont let somebody take control in your life or dont get influenced by people that dont have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Dont try to be perfect for somebody elses, if you wanna do that then do it dont do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it. But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you cant trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Dont try to act or be somebody that youre not, show who you really are and your true color because thats how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest. It takes time for other people to open their eyes but when they do they will realize a lot of stuff going on. Be yourself and dont let nobody change you in any way, be unique.",5,7,7,7,5,6,2316,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

When i worked in Krespy Kreem my manager tought me something which is a way to win the customer with a positive attitude that i have to follow. the service called ""the sweet"" service this word stand for smile,welcome,entice,engage,and thank. Having a positive attitude help you to beacame a friend and close to people and people will alwys feel confortable to talk to you. But having a negative attitude will make poeple fell unsafe around you and you will be lonely and not welcomed to the most of people. Having a positive attitude also help you to be a teacher because you will always motivate your students and provide for them education. The reason why students skip classes is because of the teachers attitude. students prefer the teacher who give a friendly smile. Positive attitude helps me alout to be an successful athlet because my coach is always happy from the way i act and my leadership that i do infront of my teamates. It makes me a respectful person and trustful guy. In fact attitude is the way the person present his/her personality. People with a negative attitude are mostly asocial and introverts. In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person whos always angry and frustrated. thats why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and whos open for evryone. The best way to live your life and be polite all the time is to have a positive attitude most poeple respect the person who give a smile and greet them. One of the importance of good attitude is bieng a family member. My uncle is the type of person who communicate and discuss with evryone and the way he talk is likeable from evryone because his always friendly and welcomed from poeple. Politicians with positive attitude are always persuasive because they use communication skills to convince the audience by telling thier speech. Attitude is a way to find a job because when the person get an enterview with a manger he has to answer the question kindly and with a respectful way. One of the reasons of bieng a good student is acting with a positive attitude infront of my classmate. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life becuase its the way to live with poeple and find a job and create a family.

439,2001,E80C88E9837C,"I agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of succes, because the way to become to the success is not gonna be easy. All the people that try to have a good success they gonna have failure on the way and sometime they fall apart, but they never have to loss their enthusianm, because the succes consists in fall apart and wake up again, and keep going looking for a good success that gonna be graet for their life and their family gonna be haughty of them. I agree because, the life gonna put many impediment to have a good success we have to keep going do not have to loss aur enthusiasm, for example. My family came of a poor family, but I have an ancle that he never loss his enthusiasm of has a good success, so he worked too hard for it. One failure that he has on his way to the succes was the poorness, but he keep going wrestlering for get uot of the poorness and help his father and mother, one day he found a job and begin to meke money and his first thing that he made was to buy a bed for him, then he to begin to save money to come to this country, now he has a lot money in his bank account because he put his own company of landscaping, but he never loss his enthusiasm about his success. I agree with this statement, because there is a lot example of how the people have many failure and they keep going never loss their enthusiasm of their success, one of this example is of one soccer player his name is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a famous soccer player, but to have a great success he had many failure one of thase failure was that his father died when hi was a kid it was hard for him even has to see a psychologist and he to overcome that, he keep going looking for his success, but he failure again because the people and couches that saw him, dont believe him they say like he doesnt has future, but he keep work in his success and show to all the people that dont believe him that they was wrong. Because he has a future and he gonna has a great success, now he is the best soccer player in the world for many people, but he always worked so hard to get out of the failure and he to obtain a good success. I agree with Mister Churchill, because the way for a great success is gonna be long and we gonna have many filure to obtain this, for example. I am trying to graduate from high school, but one of failure was that it is not been easy for me, because this is a new language for me and it is dificult to talk, but I keeping going trying to get my diploma , another failure is that I have to work for pay may rent and buy my own stuff, shoes, clothes, and food, it make more dificult to have my success, but I know that success consists on fall apart and wake up, but I never loss my enthusiasm of to be graduate from high school. One day I gonna say that my success wasnt easy but I obtain a good success. In Conclution I agree with ""churchills statement about success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him because on the way to a great success we gonna have many failure but we donthave to loss our enthusiasm, because in the world there is a lot people that they never loss their enthusiasm, even when they have a failure they always weke up and keek going, now they have a good success, so if we want a great success in our life we have to keep going wrestlering with all the failure that we gonna have.

441,2583,856351253492,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Will if you try will you be able to grow more? Does it matter what you eat? What can you do about you height? I disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because i dont think that you can make yourself taller. He say if you try will it even work? I still think if you try it wont work because the height we have now is because our father in heaven made how we are now. First, it doesnt matter if you try or not your height and how you look it comes from your parents genes, and it can also come from another family member. I dont think that you can do anything about your height because it depends on your family too. Even if you try you all you can do is to try to have a nice body, but about you height i dont think you could get taller then you already are. The only thing that can change is your body what i mean is if you chubby, over weight you can do excuse so you can have your body the you once wanted to have. If you really skinny you can eat a little bet more, but if you like how your are now you dont have to change anything. But like i always say ""Love yourself and how you look no matter what people say, the only one who could change you is yourself."" Second, I dont think you can make yourself taller because there is no way that you can become taller then you already are , and dont you think that the really short people will be taller by now then shorter. I think that they would not like to be short because in this world there is really mean people that will laugh about others, or how they look, and how short they are. So that is why I think that there is no way to make yourself taller. Dont you think that short people will be short, and be laugh at no they would not like that son that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson. In the other hand, it does matter to eat healthy so you can be in shape and you will be in this life longer. Normally you can do anything about your height because trust me if you could ive been taller by now. I dont like to be short because sometimes i get judged by my height, or how i look, and how chubby i am and i would like to have everything perfect like all those ladies and girls in the magazines or in the TV shows, and i would like to be 6 .3 ft tall then 5.3 ft. So yeah they is no way to change how you look , but by fixing yourself like: Appalachians, surge, and other things you understand what i mean right. So that means that i still disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because there is no way that people can make them self taller because even short people or person will be the size or shape they will like to be. This world is not that perfect because if it was everything or everyone will be how they world want to be in this world. So that is why i disagree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson as you can see i give reasons and examples. This goes to the person that readys my story please give me a changes to pass just one i have never pass an SOL before and i will be really happy if you could pass me just once in my life. On this one i have tried my really best so you could understand me what am talking about.

For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. Im not saying all students cant attend online classes at home, but most cannot. Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day.

School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students.

You cant forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. Another reason being home schooled isnt a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible.

453,1048,524CD617574D,"Do you think success consists of going from failure to failure? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In my opinion, when you want to reach your goal or your dream you can fail or success but you shouldnt never give up you should keep trying till you reach your goal. So, I do not agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of the success. Theres no people that hasnt failed in his/her life at least once but there are some that did success, you only have to work really hard or fight for what you want, and you shouldn never loss your enthusiasm, that is something that people should never forget, to have enthusiasm for something. First, there is not people that has not failed at least once in their whole life. In this world there is a lot of people that had mistaken, failed or disappointed. For example in their goal, getting a job, not getting good grades in school, not succeeding and etc. there is no perfect people that hasnt make any mistake. Failing does not always have to be about your personal life. You could fail your family or friends just by lying them or disappointing them. Maybe there are some people that hasnt failed just few like 1%. I do said this because my cousin, she has never disappointed or failed their parents she has really good grades and have a higher score in school she already graduated with a scholarship. Now she is in Virginia Tech University. In order to reach your goal or your dream, you have to work really hard to success. If you had failed once or more do not get sad or depressed yourself you are strong enough to handle it. There is always an opportunity or another chance that life will give you. Work hard you should never give up easily, fight for what you want reach your big dream. Life is not easy life is hard no one ever has said that life was easy if you want something you have to work hard for it, I know you get drop down(sad) by failing in something but you can get up. If you cant success in something make another plans there is a lot to do and another opportunities that you can get, do not just get stuck in one thing. Look for other things that you want and maybe you will like it and enjoy it. People in this world should never lose their enthusiasm. You are enthusiasm for something go for it do not let other people to do that for you or take it. Enthusiasm is something to appreciate and work hard for it. Not everyone is enthusiasm they dont have that; that interest, that strong warmth of feeling, or that inspired of something you would love to do or have. Be proud of yourself if you are enthusiastic for something. People without it has no feeling for something they dont care about their lives or future they only get what they can do for it, they dont give their feeling for it. They accept what they get. For Instance, when I was a kid I use to be really good at my school I was the best student with good grades, but when I moved here to US I had to start again because I didnt know any English so to success with my English I really had to work hard. In conclusion, I do not agree with Churchills statement. Success does not have to consists of going from failure to failure. You do fail a lot of times but If you dont give up and work really hard you can success for your goal or your big dream. Just never lose the enthusiasm that you have for something, that keeps you up for it, the warmth feeling you have the inspire and interest for it is strong so dont give up. Always work hard for what you want and you will success. Life isnt easy not even for reach people. ",5,6,6,4,4,6,1075,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Like be nice to people dont be rude, disrespectful, and mean. Thats not going to help you in life. whats the point of being mean. Dont take your anger out on others. Just because someone else did something to make you mad. Taking your anger out on someone who didnt do anything is not going to help. Itss making the problem worse. Things happen for a reason, Maybe it happens to teach you a lesson. Dont rush things in your life. Give things time, be patient. You dont know what can happen if you rush things in life. Everything has a time, you just have to wait until it comes. If something happens it happens you can do anything but to hope that things will get better. Life for an example, Lets just say that someone important gets sick. Like really sick that they had to go to the hospital. Its scary right? But what can you do to stop it. Nothing but to hope that they will get better. thats how life is. Life teaches us a lesson. We need to believe, have hope in life. if we dont how can we know things will get better.

456,807,297ABDDBAA92,"How is possible to people think that success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with ministre Winston; it always would be a new oportunitie to change the mistake people learn from failure. It gives everyone a chance to corret it. I also believe that failure is an important part in life to people must have success. One notable reason is that people learn from failure. For example, sometimes people get involved in some sadness problems that consist in failure. People have the oportunitie to corret it; they would be able to reach their dreams or goals not matter how harder is life people always have to strive with enthusiasm. Moreover, in my personal opinon, 3 years ago I was playing for a soccer team I get involved in a situation where I got really stressful with myself because I training hard for playing the final game with my team. Unfortunately, I cant play the final game because the game before I commited a foul and I get a red card. my team loss the game, it was too lake for me do anything about it. I realized that not matter what I did in the past; it always be a new oportunitie for improve and teach myself that failure its has an important role in life to be success. Futhermore, another important reason is that it gives people a better chance to corret it. This reminds me to a friend, who was in a situation where he was really disappoint because he fail his driving test. The next day, he cames to my house and talk to me about it. I remember that I told him to keep in his mind that its important to be prepare for any situation that you know you have a lot of chances to pass if you triying and triying you will get on it. A lack of success depending in achieving goals and dreams. I think that failure is also a way to teach people that even if you fail you just always have to try no matter how many times you try it as long as you trying without lossing the enthusiasm you will reach your dreams, or goals. Some people would argue that success is not consist in failure; however, everyone in our society knows that failure is an important part in life to be success. People learn from failure and it gives people a better chance to corret it. There is not limits to reach ours dreams as long as you keep going to complete it. Provides everyone a learning that not martter how harder is life, there would be millions of chances to be success with anything you want to do. In conclusion, success consist in failure without lossing enthusiasm.

457,1381,25FA30699A04,"Should schools control students involvement in extracurricular activities, or should the decision regrading extracurricular involvement to left to students and their families? Students should decide on what extracurricular activities they will be interested in and discuss with their families because parents or guardians can support their decisions, they can be able to find their talents, and be able to get awesome scholarships or grades. First students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because parents or guardians can support their children. Students will be absolutely be proud of their families by supporting them to do what they like, for example like sports. Teenagers are interested in activities because they like their own sports or the whole family likes sports. Students likes to get an approval from their families because they feel euphoria when their family accepts them. Teenagers also love when parents or guardians support them because they can have persuasive thoughts about the extracurricular activities. Second students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because they can be able to find their talents. Coaches from different activities can see how good the students are and can see their special talents in them. Students are not perfectionist like god but instead they work really hard to show that teens can do it. Teenagers can also feel that they are talented because maybe it can be in their family tree lines. Students can figure out their talents by practicing everyday and be able to play like how professional do it. Also Teenagers will realize how to never give up on their activities. Finding their talents is an entertaining expression because people around the world can be amazed at how teenagers can be so good at extracurricular activities. Third students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because they can get awesome scholarships or grades. Students can get scholarships by showing how much their activities mean to them. Teenagers get much better scores on their grades because they can be able to focus and stay healthy. It can be helpful for their college, their future, and their family status. Their coaches will be really proud of them by getting scholarships from different countries. Getting amazing grades and scholarships is the legendary epic passionate feeling that students will never forget in their lives. Another point of view is many students do not like the school to control their activities. However, many people believe that school should have total control regarding extracurricular involvement of students after school because that think that school staff knows better and that they can guide students to get involve into more productive activities. Which would eventually result into a more bright and smart teens who would feel more comfortable to face the real world. In conclusion deciding on the extracurricular activities they will be interested in will benefit their scholarships or grades, their families will support their children, and the students will find their true talents. So teenagers can become the 10 out of 10 in their best of the extracurricular activities. Also students can now decide and control their own extracurricular activities being able to become a legendary, passionate, euphoric, having awesome persuasive thoughts, and epic person.

458,1905,C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators. One of the first lessons Ill share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you dont be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use theres other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"". Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life its always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities youll get. Lastly, being good communicators. In life youll always have to communicate if its your friends, teachers or your family, youll always be communicating. For an example, I cant communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I dont want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends.

461,864,1736153EF81F,"Well, I feel that working with a group is better than working alone. In my opinion is more easy to work with other people and you can be sociable working like that ,theres a lot benefits and reasons why I prefer more work together than work alone. Let me explain what are my reasons why I prefer work in a group and why I dont like to work alone. First of all, I prefer work together because is more easy and you can finish your work quicky. For example, is you work in group of three, one member can search for the information about the topic, another member can make a poster showing examples about the topic and the last one has to organize how they are going to present and explain the topic. However, if I work alone I have to do all the work by my own, and it can takes a lot time to finish the project. Second of all, Working together is so funny you can talk with your classmates about the topic, and having good discussions. I feel comfortable working in a group and I enjoy working like that, because they share their opinions with you, even you can learn more from your classmates than the information of the topic, it can be strange,but it is true you dont know how much they know about the topic. Sometimes you cant understand the topic, but you have your group and ask questions to them, and they can help you to understand the topic. Third of all, Working in groups can be sociable, you can have a good time knowing new people and make new friends. I think is good be sociable because you can learn new things about them and you can develop your knowlege getting the new information from your classmates. For example, if you dont know anythink about history and you are in a group, and you ask who knows something about history and someone likes history you can aks him about it, and you can get new information about history and at the same time you are being sociable. However, if you are working alone, you cant ask to anybody because you dont know them. In conclusion, thats are the reasons why I prefer working in a group. Working together can be easy you can share the work with your group, you can have a good time with your classmate talking about the topic , and you can develop your friendship making new friends.",7,6,7,5,6,7,323,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
462,2950,33F18D5D8867,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home help then not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by students getting to much school work that cannot all handled in one night. Everyday kids complain about having to much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at home gain more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at school helps kids to succeed and have better grades. No only does learning at home provide less distraction, it provides students with flexible schedule. First, Students complain about having to much homework because students who spend a lot of time on their homework and dont have enough free time for them to relax is considered having to much homework. When they get out school and they have to practice some sports them they have to go to their house just to eat and them to do their homework, they cannot spend time with their family. Homework can limit the time. Students can spend with their friends, family, or other activities they can do. Too much homework can also give students more pressure from parents interference, this may cause unhealthy amount of stress. This is why students prefer home school. Second, One of the best things about home school is that It can be done at anytime because It can be done at any time, children have a flexible time schedule with mean that the parents can helps. The student can work around schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. Home schools allow students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homeschooling is that there are not rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules, the students can focus on their studies. Third, when you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are may distraction that can make students loss focus on what there are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit student. Learning from home wont have the distraction that that a classroom has. As a result of this, student wont loss focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reason students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment they are no familiar with, which makes then feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and wont stress about work. In a school, you are stuck at desk for 6 hours and have limit time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This does not helps students at all. In conclusion, the environment at home will benefit students by giving them better grades. In conclusion, Students should be offered classes online because the environment is less stressful, which could benefit test scores. At home there is less distractions, rather than at school where are many different things to worry about. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. Many students successfully take some, and even all, classes from home. School systems and all districts should offer distance learning. ",8,9,8,8,8,9,672,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
463,2283,29BB45AA907C,"Have you ever asked for advice? I ask for advice when I dont understand something or when I need help. When I need advice I ask multiple people so I can get everyones opinion. When I get multiple peoples advice I choose one that will be best for me. What Im trying to say is that asking for more advice can be useful. One reason why I think asking for multiple advice is good, and helpful because people could be going through rough times. People ask for advice sometimes because maybe they have family problems, and they need help so they go ask people for advice. When you need advice you dont have to ask one of your family members, you can ask a teacher you trust, your counselor, or your friends. Out of all the advice you get you can choose one advice that you think could help you the most or you can use all the advice people gave you and try them to see if the advice would help. There can be many different reasons why poeple ask for several of advice. Second reason of why I think asking for multiple advice is good. Another reason why people ask for advice is because they could be making a club, and they might not know what to do. Club members can put up posters, and ask people to write their advice or opinions on what they should do to make the club better, and more interesting. All the advice they will get is going to help them make the club better and they could get more members added to their club. When you ask for advice from people their advice can make things better. My third reason is, sometimes you are so nervous for a test so you go ask for advice from people. When you want advice for a test you can go to your teacher and ask them for advice, or you can also ask other kids that have took the test before and they can give you some good advice since they took the test already. Advice can really help you if you are nervous. When you are nervous and people are giving you some advice their advice can help you calm down. Sometimes you can also give yourself some adviceb by saying to yourself ""you got this"" or ""you are going to do good on this test"". I say that asking multiple people for advice is important. Its important because all the advice people give you can help you through out the day.

Generic_Name had no way to communicate with the employer; However, when Generic_Name got to the place where she was going to be interviewed,she explained what happened and it was the reason why she was late to her job interview and she was sorry for it,because her phone was really expensive Generic_Name had a bad attitude with the employer even though it was not the fault of the employer. Because of the bad attitude of Generic_Name,she had the result of not obtaining the job Generic_Name always dreamed of. Since that day Generic_Name controls her attitude and learned that a positive attitude is the key to success in life even if we are having hard times. If an individual thinks that a positive attitude is not the way to be successful relax because there are a lot of ways to show him or her that a positive attitude is the success in life. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because of better opportunities and a non-stressed life. To begin with, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because of better opportunities. Society might have no problems at school or at any place they go if they have a good attitude and know how to control themselves. For example, my cousin Generic_Name since she was little was a really good student, and always had great comments from her teachers because of her attitude and effort at school. Last year when Generic_Name graduated from Generic_School, a lot of important people offered her to work with them because they have seen the way Generic_Name was a great students, even though when she was on her bad days she always had a good attitude. Some people might say that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because it can lead people to have some opportunities of good works and also to have friends, but they are wrong because having a good attitude all the time will help people to have greater opportunities at work as well at school. Also that people could never have any complain for having a bad attitude because they know how to control themselves. To continue,a positive attitude is the key to success in life because of a non-stressed life. Having a positive attitude can lead people to have a better future in their lives. Also, my neighbour Generic_Name used to live in California where he had no friends because Generic_Name was really shy. Since Generic_Name moved to Virginia with his Mom Generic_Name and his brother Generic_Name,he have met a lot of people at school and also in his neighborhood, which now they are friends. Generic_Name used to be really quiet because he was scared of what people might think about him, but lately he have made a bunch of new friends and have a happy and non-stressed life he no longer thinks about what people is going to judge him;Nevertheless, Generic_Name have learned that a good attitude of the key to success in life.

467,3272,2D940E7F240C,"Do you think that schools should extend the school hours for 1 hour and 30 min? I agreee with this plan because it would help students education. It can help students with their education: The teachers would be able to explain more to the students so they can understand properly. Teachers can help educate the students by using the extra time to do more projects. The teachers can read more books with the class so they can be good readers and writers. It would give students less days of school: Students can get more relaxing time and come to school with a lot of energy. Students can get more time working on school work/homework at home during the weekend. Students wouldnt have to worry about going to school on the days that the school chooses to skip. It can help students can get a lot smarter with extra hours: The students can get extra time to do homework and trying to understand everything during the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes. The teachers can take the whole class to the library to check out or read books with the classroom. Students can have an extended gym time to get rid of all the energy inside them so they can learn and obtain all the information from the teachers. I think that the extra 1 hour and 30 minutes would help students with education. It can really help the students because they get more time on their weekends and it gives them more time to study,work on homework, or finish a project.

But, Not all the schools has these benefits and also because some students dont have how to go to these schools and all of us students do not can go to any high school. I think thats the only bad thing because if you drive, you just can go and then back your home and some times if someone is giving to you ride is good as well but its not gonna be every time then you would have to find who can take you to school and who can pick you up from the school. Well I think we the student to commit to a career at a young age is well because we can be graduated more early. the good news is if you go to thats schools you can learn more and choose what do you wanna study for college thats a good point and also you may have a lot of opportunities, In some high schools you needed have good grade for going there and passing clases too. in others words if you dont have a good grades you cant sign for that schools.

Because, it described us by having a good conduct, a positive personality, and a attitude. This is something the help us to have a good success in life. Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive. My first reason is having a good conduct it help us to be a better person, every where we go. Because, is going to be useful For example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us. My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It help us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can asked the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works so we can improved our grades. My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend friend to find a new job were I work. So, she got a interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude so they will might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others. We always need to have a good attitude so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us.

471,2361,3F80F96A6F5A,"Some people believe in praising a students to help them build self-esteems. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. On the other hand, other people believe that self-esteems comes from achievements. I think that self-esteems comes from both learning and achievements, but it mostly come by telling a students that there work is good for these three reasons. One reason is that people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, sometime people would want to have the stuff the students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldnt hurt their feeling. The first reason is that people are complementing to student for their work that student have created. Some people would say nice things and walk away or they would stay and talk about what the student made and the meaning behind what the student created. I remember when I was a little kid, I built a toy car and my mom like it. So when im older, I want to create my own car and show my mom how good I am at building cars. My mom was the one who has help me boost my self-esteem. That is what teachers should do to student if they want to boost their self-esteem. Another reason, is that sometime people would want to have the stuff that students would create. For example, say if you made a painting and someone on the street saw it. Then the person would want to buy it and you sold it to him. That would make you want to create even more painting and sell it. It would make the student think that the person like your painting that you created and that boost you into selling more painting. The more stuff you create. The more people would want to buy it. That is an another reason to help boost students self-esteems. The last reason is that people would say nice thing so they wont hurt your feeling, But they do that because there jealous that they cant do the stuff that you can create. There are some people in the world that just give you hateful comment about your creation. And that doesnt mean that you can stop doing what you want to do. It doesnt matter because there are other people that are gonna like the thing that you create. There are people out there that maybe want to buy your stuff probably even a famous person would want to buy it. In conclusion, people would try to believe in students so they could have self-esteem. But there also people out in the word that maybe dont like the stuff that you create. But there also people that do like the stuff that you create. That is why people are giving good complement to student for their work that the student have done, they sometime would want to have the stuff that students would create, and last people would say nice thing to students so the other people wouldnt hurt their feeling.",8,7,6,8,6,7,825,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
472,1463,F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do. Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good. And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind. Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Names family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Names family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Names family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them. In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

Students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasnt any difference. Sometimes the studentst doesnt make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza. It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesnt even eat, they even go a whole day without eating. If the school were to change the unhealthy food they should get rid of pizza, hot dogs, and chicken nuggets and make up for potatos with rice and chicken, a nice pasta salad with tomatoes, onions, and, spinich. Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If thats the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, its not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do. In reality, it really doesnt matter because students still eat school food, some students do complain about how nasty the food is but they still wont bring their own food how logical is that. To be honest there are sometimes good lunches like we said before its not best thing in the world. So its okay dont waste on changing something when you knew it could of been done from the start.

476,2216,FBE180CF324E,"To begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? When two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because People are probably not themselves, People opinion change, People never have the same intellectual connection. For example Generic_Name went to the movies with his girlfriend Generic_Name, his mom Generic_Name, and his sister Generic_Name. Generic_Name tells Generic_Name to invite her boyfriend Generic_Name. Generic_Name interaction with Generic_Name was unpleasant, based on what Generic_Name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. Days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what Generic_Name thought at first and what she thinks now. Secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. Their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. Why? First because they are starting to get to know new people. Second they have no idea what to expect from people. Third, some people do above and beyond to impress. Now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. Sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. Society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are. However, peoples opinion change from time to time. Visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. We end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? It means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. We might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self dont have that confidence. For example Generic_Name was mad at Generic_Name for not going to the bank with her. So Generic_Namea said that they would no longer be friends. The next day she text her and said what time am I picking you up. Their was a change of opinion from night to morning. Lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. When you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. For example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. When two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. People would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person. In conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because People are not themselves, People opinion change, and People never have the same Intellectual connection. Peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. First impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job , friendship, or to be a partner. Society now in days have to look out more to make sure everythig is in order. Thats why we have people who do research and look back to records, thats why jobs and people have a process of doing things.

477,3076,8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study? Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school. In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, students grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved. Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying. Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken. In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken.

478,3106,30DDC17D2986,"First impressions are very important but could they be changed?. Yes, yes they could be changed because first impressions dont justify who you are as a person and some people dont act the same when you first meet them. However some people are really judgmental about first impressions and could block off any type of relationship they had with you being job related, maybe girlfriend or boyfriend, and friends. First impressions are serious which drives a lot of people insane. Because they dont know how the people are going to react to them but, its okay that doesnt define who you are as a person. A great tip of advice is being able to read a room that means how people are acting in certain time and place. Like whats the vibe and mood if you should be more relaxed, goofy,serious etc. If you can read a room first impressions will become a lot easier because you will know how to act. But thats not the only way to have a good first impression most people dont act the same say on the first date,its probably going to be awkward and silent because you dont know how to act verses seeing someone for the 5th time. You know what to say, you know how to have an okay conversation. But dates arent the only situations that first impressions fall into. Jobs, jobs are the biggest make or break for first impressions from experience you cant be nervous and just be real you dont have to act differently. If your job takes you for what you have then its a great job. However first impressions are very very judgmental. Some people take first impressions over anything because its the first glimpse they have of you and how you act as a person. And if they dont like you wont give you a job or another date depending on the situation. And there is nothing you can do about it. not even getting the chance to change the first impression. So is it hard to change a first impression yes,but its not impossible.",7,7,8,7,7,7,639,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
479,2094,DA994B5C3784,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. Thats why I believe that people should always try to seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but its always good to take advice from experts. Its always good to talk to someone in case of an emergency. For example I was sick at home with a lot of pain and I refused to go to the hospital, until I talked to a doctor about how I was feeling and he suggested that I go to the hospital to get checked up and I did and it made me feel a lot better. Sometimes its good to take an experts advice in a matter like I was in, you dont always have to take their advice but its good to just talk to someone about it and keep in mind what they say for future references. Its always good to follow your own instincts but sometimes its not. Their are people who have experienced the same thing you might be going through right now and are certified or trained to help. For example my aunt is currently training to be a consular for high school kids and her goal is to gain the trust of her students so they can come to her when they need help. She always tells me that she was a high school kid at a point and she knows what its like and the problems kids might be going through, so thats why shes training to help them in making the right decisions. When I need help making a life decision about something like college I go to my consular whos been in college and knows what could be right for me, I always take in mind what they advice me and make a decision. It doesnt always necessarily need to be help for an adult it can always be help from a sibling or other family member who has been through what you have and who you know will lead you in the right direction. I understand that some people may like making their own decisions but its always good to take advice from experts.

480,2481,C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen. Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that shes not telling you the truth but you dont know the truth. Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different. When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change shes happy now. Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say. Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something. I hope you never impress by something or someone, that can be different that you thought, thats why we dont judge, God is the only one who can judge.",4,6,6,6,6,7,2593,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 4"
481,1518,FFD9A83B0849,"Working alone, students do not have to argue with other about decission of their proyects and have to work with someone they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students are able to dived work, to share ideas and to help each other. Working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. Personally and due to the facts, I would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students. Firstly. Most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth 10% of the periods grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. Each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do. Secondly. Working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. Companies usually use the phrase: ""Work as a team"" to make their productivity more efficiently. Teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others. By allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. Schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. A group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive. To conclude, No students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. Many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. Working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject.",8,8,8,8,7,6,3908,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
482,3449,3E4B70F8555C,"The benefits of working with a group or working alone. Which do you feel is more beneficial. In my opinion, I believe working with a group is more beneficial because a group creates different ideas, team work to win the competition, and entertain the audience. First, each person of the group has a different thoughts and different ideas. They share their ideas to create incurable, different, complete thoughts as a group. Some of the ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen. Team work to win the competition is to work together. Each person has to play a different correcters and roles. Some of them in the group they have to support the main correcter in the stage or back of the stage. Rehearse time to make it inconvenient to be with family members to reach their accomplishment. Finally, entertaining the audience is most important to each group member. An audience is the people come to enjoy the show, each of the group member are work hard to convince and entertain the audience. Each group member has one leader to follow their roles in specific time to make the show more interact. I think, the wonderful job can be done working together as a team, developing their ideas and creating entertainment in their performances . And, also, their task is to gives the fans happiness and good time. Team members, families, and teachers will feel proud.

I feel like sometime its better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad.

Nothing?, or run away to where you can make your own plans?. NO!. I strongly agree that, people should make decisions on their own. Making decisions on your own can make you stronger. For example, when i realize i was failing my science class. I took a decision on my own by telling myself; i need to pass this class for the rest of the quarter. And im doing great now because i put in my mind with all my strength, focused and im doing more than amazing. If someone gave me that decision to pass that class, i wouldnt be able to, because i havent made my mind up to that and maybe i dont or not into that class. Secondly, you know your challenges to your decision that you make by yourself. For instance, i tried out this year for the school soccer team. I knew it was only 2 option: either you make it or you get cut out. So, me knowing that made me work harder when i get on the pitch. I get pains in my legs when i get home but i also know that, i have do it again tomorrow so it makes me do extra work home so that i wont be ill but be in shape for the next day. Lastly, sometimes we make a bad decision which help us learn. To prove this, 3 weeks ago, my mom ask me to clean her bathroom for her, also i had a club to attend. Because i knew going to club will be fun and meeting new friends so, i told my mom im going to the club instead, and i will clean the bathroom the next day. And so, i went to the party. A friend of mine was a drug dealer: i didnt know, and he was wanted my the police. He came to the same party and we were sharing the same table. We were drinking, chatting, eating and having fun. All of a sudden, we saw 3 police men that came to arrest my friend but because we were sitting together; we were all arrested because him. If i choose to clean the bathroom this would have not happen to me. The lesson that i learned is that; i dont need to follow my decision every time, and also know who hang around with. As a results, making decisions on our own can make us strong and focused, know our challenges and also learn. If all this ability only get reviewed when we make decisions on our own, why should we seek for guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters?.

I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it.

Some people say that schools shouldnt extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then lets see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on hes classes? this person is losing 2 things; 1, losing energy 2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it. Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes. Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also its good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another mans treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class. Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.

When coaches gave us advice to play good and win games that teams will be come so good if the players get the advice of the coach. When people ask for advice is because they want to know what things are better like to buy. If we shop somewhere then you need a advice from someone to know if is good or bad.

The person who do not gave a advice of what they doing they will get in trouble if good for our body or not good. When we are in math class the students gave us advice same with the teacher. Sometimes students gave us advice how to do the work of the problem more than one student gave us advice. When teacher shows advice of our class work how to do it and know when test are coming for be ready. Also the bus driver gave us advice how to act inside the bus. If the bus driver does not gave advice everyone in the bus will act crazy and maybe a accident. Thats why everyone should said a advice for we could be safe and be good.,5,4,5,4,4,6,3000,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
493,3528,BBB9D66F934C,So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School. Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen. So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50 chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year,5,5,6,5,6,5,2530,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas. My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks. my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out. Well I think it is important to have some pranks in our life it make us feel joy and happy afterword because how the world is now a days, they is not that much joy in life more people then ever are sad so we all need sometimes a laugh in our lives no better way to do it by a harmless prank. pranking people is my talent those are some reason why I am good at pranking people and that how I use pranking in my life.",5,5,6,6,5,6,2148,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
495,1007,7D94F809823A,"Many people agree, that the use of technology brings a positive impact by allowing people to complete many task like. looking for information, buying a book, buying video games, and shopping. and looking for technology as a way to communicate which can limit the opportunities to use verbal communication. I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health. Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy. Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons. In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

If you miss one day of school you will be hind in all your class because teacher give us to much work. Student would get bad grade if teacher give us to much work to get us behind.

499,2548,39492CE9549E,"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, ""I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days"". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scared to complete the test before the timer goes off because I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future. Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakes in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said ""I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even though you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job"". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focused and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the year I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projects teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy because most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible. Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.

500,1276,EFF1803E4B81,"Why are people scared to fail? Is failing really a bad thing. NO! For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. It just means you need some more time. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Which I encourage everyone to do. When you fall get back up everyone falls. Life is about taking risks and failing. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Failiure is the key to success. Without failing you cant really call it success. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. Everyone has failed to do something. Not everyone in the world is perfect. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. That without failiure there is no success. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect. Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. This is what makes you try again. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough dont give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. Failing is a good thing not a bad. However, its hard for people to think in this way becuase they think once they fail its all over. Its not over until you want it to be over.

501,1452,E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in peoples minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives. The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called "" I Have A Dream "" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites segregation laws was. The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset. The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration. In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.",10,8,10,8,8,9,3354,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

When he wrote this people was scare because their people was slave before Abraham Lincol become president of the United State. This show three reason why he wrote this. First, Thomas Jefferson spend his time with us because he want to see how his people really following his wrote. Many people dont think about what they can do in their life, if we still spend time with other people we dont accomplish our own dreams, sometimes people are shy,and scare with their dreams because other people can bother them because they can accomplish their dreams or may be they dont believe in them.

Some people are in school but they dont see the opportunity that we have for make a lot stuff in the future. We just go at school because our mothers dispatch us at the school.

First some students might want to boost there GPA so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the class room, so they might need more support in class insted of taking arts classes. students need to improve on there grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someones shift and your boss tells you to come in and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little borther or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in a extra class or in study hall.

In todays day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends. My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that youve never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more. My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it. My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do. Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.",8,9,9,9,9,8,3814,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

510,2822,F893E9ED1F0C,Should school have to add one and half hours to each day? I disagree because student have to do stuff after school like some student have practice for sports and more. Another reasons why I disagree is because student might not like school and it can get boring. Something else why I disagree is because parents might want you after school for something and if you come from school late them cant do what your parents are telling u want to do. Some reasons why I disagree is because you might have to do thing after school. Something are you might have sports practice for a team or for clubs. Another reason why is because some students have family things to do out of school and it would be for a long time. Some student would have doctor appoints and that is very important. Another reasons why I disagree is because student will get bored in school. Some student can start to get mad try to leave the school and get in trouble and the student can get in a fight. Something else is that student can fall asleep and not pay attention to the teachers and they can get trouble as well as the student can stay even longer. Something is that they would not be able to learn if they fall asleep. Last reasons why I disagree is because parents might need their child after school for something. There parents might need them to help clean them clean there house. If they need to tell them something important. Another reason why is because there parents might need help to buy food for there house. Some parents might not like that because they would not be able to see there child for a long time. That why I disagree because school is just for certain time it not all day. Some student will get bored and not want to come school again. They might have thing to do after school like sports and practices or other thing. Some student parent might need help from there child and would want to see them more time not for a little while. That why I disagree that we should not have add and half hours to each day. ,7,6,6,6,6,7,3731,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
511,2804,6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over anothers person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are. I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other persons personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media. Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow. I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone elses life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion peoples actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do. It is like when someone ask a child, "" what do you want to be when you become an adult"". ",6,7,8,6,6,8,1411,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
512,2243,35A7E263AC71,"the prompt says ""Unless you try something beyond what you have mastered you will never grow"". one would say that is something very wise to say .But due to the lack of wisdom around the world it is basically useless to say anything wise. I personally agree apart from physically growing Im almost done. Going back to the topic I do agree with what author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote, That if you dont try something beyond on what i have mastered am I really growing in any way ? I have try anything new and just do the same routine over and over im not going to make far in life .Although I cant think of a reason why someone would disagree the statement. I have tried many thing my seventeen years of being alive, and I can say I have grown to be the person I am now .Many people dont try new thing only because they are quick to judge on the presentation of the new item or new person , but if people actually gave the new experience a chance it could be life changing for better or worse . So going back to you trying something beyond what i mastered I wont grow or something like that its all in perspective if I wish to try something new and be a better person in society I will but if I wish to not try anything at all and just to the same boring routine day after day .Sooner or later I will get bored of everything .Even though some may argue by saying ""thats how I got successful in the first place by doing the same routine over and over"". In some cases that may work for example in sports the athlete must do the same thing over and over until the get better at the sport or like a dance they practice the same dance over and over until it;s ready to be shared with the world how well one can dance . And for others trying a new routine can lead them to success (well maybe not everyone is talented) In conclusion trying something new does change who you are in a bit by either helping or destroying yourself .People do grow to be wise and old and other dont grow old wise just young and reckless. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson was a wise man to say ""Unless you try something beyond what you already have mastered you will never grow. thank you for taking the time to read this essay .

513,3777,1348668DF845,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early? School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years. If they allow high school students to graduate in three years , they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL. In any other state would agree on graduating high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating for high school. Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation , and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years. It would be a a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL , as a student i would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and i would not like to take courses during the evening , it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work. People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work so they can graduate faster in 3 years .

More than 100 years ago, people used their mind to build machines, planes, rockets, television , bridges, etc. Most of the things were build my their own imagination. Our worlds one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways. ""Imagination"" is the power of mind to make something creative. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didnt thought of. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine. Also It helps your mind get stronger. When you thinking about anything, your brain is running from one place to another place to get the next task. In a human brain, we do 5% conscious and 95% unconscious things everyday. You are learning something new everyday, your brain collecting data based what you do in a everyday life basis. When you imaging something, your brain brings back the data from your past and puts it in your imagination. In that way,you know what you should in your imaginary work. Also, In that way your brain are becoming more conscious by your little thinking process and its making your brain stronger everyday. Imaginary can make you an open minded person. If you are good at imaging, when you are gonna talk to other people and they tries to explain you their situation, First, you will imagine yourself into that situation. Second, you will understand what they have been went through. Then you will think what should I do to make that person feel better. Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future. In conclusion, I think imagination is better than knowledge. It makes you a good person, It makes you open minded, It helps your brain to get stronger.

517,2635,4C17DB6FF2DC,"John Lubbock quotes on choosing your own character or letting influences form your is a passage I can live by. For the reason of it being actually true because, sometimes things you see throughout your life would change your character. The people you look up to can can your character because you want to be just like them. but sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Things you see in life can change your character. Lets say you are in the streets and you get into a car accident then you are gonna have a chance to be afraid to drive a car. It can also be changed by a bad experience, lets say you are in an abusive relationship after that relationship ends you would think every girl/guy is an abusive person. What if you are living in foster care and you never get adopted you will think that you will never among to nothing and be nothing your whole life. The people you look up to can have a dramatic change in your character. Lets say your father is your biggest inspiration you will want to be just like him when your older and follow in his foot steps. But, if your inspiration isnt anyone in your family but it is a famous sport player you will grind your butt off just to be in the same team with them and hopefully play along side with that player. Newer influences these days are trough social media and movies and in my opinion those are the worst ones because they usually trying to sell you something or market something to their audience. Sometimes its not always a good change sometimes you can have a bad influence. Having a bad influence can lead to a lot of trouble and you can even end up in jail for it. Lets say you look up to your father and he is a very toxic person and a violent person and you end up like him thats not a good thing. Also something that can happen is that you look up to a very bad very disturbing person and he likes to hurt people and then you start hurting people because you want to be just like him.

There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesnt have to accomplish any thing. It doesnt matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we dont know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us. First, when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. Its less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too. Second, In the past women didnt have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country. Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesnt matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasnt able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy. In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just dont lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose.

Also, I think this benefit every one on the group to do not get struggle because we are out of ideas. I know that working in group is a benefit because every one in the group is having more breaks than they will have doing separate . Also , this help every one in the group because we are less probable to stress because we all have more times on the breaks to be relax. although, they can work in differents are of the work at the same time. So, every one working in different parts benefit they because they are working faster and efficient. I think we can get more time to help each other on the work and this is great because we learned and help the group to have a good work. Every one doing this in group is a benefit and helpful way. So, doing this in group is helpful because every one can check differents part of the work and look if they find a mistake. Also, I think this is help because maybe a person did not see a mistake another one can see and can help fix it. I think all the group will benefit and we will notice the difference by working alone and working in group. Last, this benefi every one on the part they work because help about finding mstake and review if they something wrong. I think doing a team work is good because every one can improve their skills or habilities . Also, this is helpful to every one to find mistake at tell where are the mistakes are and help us fix it to have a good work. at my point of view , every get experience working with people and sharing time with person to make a good work. So, this help by having more breaks than working alone, be less stress trying to finish the work , be more relax ,and be more concentrate in the work . In conclusion, this are facts and examples why working is group is more helpuf , efficient and benefit. ",6,5,6,6,4,5,405,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
523,1341,BC0B186645A9,"Living on this planet, everyone has there own character traits. But does everyone create their own characteristic traits or are they influenced by those they surround their selfs with.? John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I take a position on representing that you are in control choosing and creating your own character. In building your own character its all in your mindset. Mindset takes a big part in someones character because it shows what kind of person you are and how you represent your self and how you portray things in life. The way you think has an effect on you as a person and how you betray things in life. It also takes part in who you surround yourself with. Do you surround yourself with people who have goals in their life or inspire you to become a better you.? It also takes part on things you choose to do and say on a daily bases. The decision you make could lead into something better or for the worse in current situations or in the long run. Having motivation and a goal in the your life builds you as a person and sets you for growth. When you see someone in your life not doing well and not in a good current situation you want to avoid being in that position. But when you start seeing someone in your life doing better things and living the life that you want to accomplish, its on your part to doubt yourself or make that you motivation. When you strive for something in life and start working hard for it, your mentality starts to change to do better and get to your goal. Some may argue that the people you surround your self with is beyond your control on how your character traits are formed. Yes the people you surround yourself with everyday might have an effect on your characteristics, but it isnt beyond your control. You can have something to motivate you to be better then who you surround your self with. You have control over your thoughts and how you see things in life. It takes part on you and what you strive for in life. In conclusion, Your own character traits are somethings that come within you and how you portray life. Your character traits aret something that is beyond your control but is something that you can control with motivation and a goal to strive for and it all comes from a strong mindet.

It allows bulling on the internet. It also allows trolling on the internet. First, Technology interferes with student social skills. For example, the student walks into the class room they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. In the class room the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others. Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. I saw a video on YouTube. A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue. Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020. The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends with out our phones. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they cant use their phones during class.

I would want to go scuba diving and get a view of the animals in the ocean. reasons why I would want to go to Hawaii because it has a huge water park. I always have fun at water parks because it has big slides and big pools and other fun stuff. But Hawaii water park is like three times the size of the water parks Ive been in. During the summer I like to go to my pool and spend my time there. I always wished I had a slide in my pool. But my pool is still fun. I invite my friends to make the pool more fun. We play sharks and Minos and other games. Another reason why I would go to Hawaii is because I want to try out their sea food. I heard their sea food is really good and it come fresh out the ocean. Personally my favorite sea food is crab. But i like crab better when its a crab soup. One more important reason why I would want to go to Hawaii is because I want to spend time with my family. I rarely get to spend anytime with my family. The reason that is because I have to go to school and my work and stuff. Then my when i comeback home my dad has to go to work. He comes back around midnight. So basically I never get to see him. I probably see him like for 10 minutes but then I cant. At least I get to see him during holidays. The first thing I would want to do when I get to Hawaii is go to the huge water park. I want to go there to have fun. I also want to ride all the slides in the park. I want to play around with my family and have fun with them. Me and my dad always go on big slides when were in a water park. Another activity I would want to do when I get there is ride a bike around the city im gonna be staying at. I want to get to know the city and all of its locations. I also would love to ride on the mountains so i can get a nice view and take some photos. Something else I would do is swim in the crystal clear oceans with my family. I have never seen my feet when im in the ocean and i want to experience that. I also want to have fun throwing a ball around with my family. The first things I would want to see in Hawaii is go scuba diving and get to see the beautiful sea creatures swim around the ocean. Also for reason I want to get to touch them, and I want to see my families reaction. I always wanted to sea wild sea creatures. I never get to sea them because the closest ocean to me is dirty so you cant see nothing under the water. I want to see them swimming around and see other animals in the water. Every time I see a sea creature. The only way I would see one is if I caught it with a fishing rod or its dead on the sand or In the aquarium. I would really want to go on a helicopter and see all of Hawaii. I just want to explore and get a beautiful view of Hawaii. At least see two dolphins hop from the ocean. That would be a perfect moment. But I just want to see Hawaii. I would probably go see one of does fire performance too. One more thing I would want to go see in Hawaii is my family having fun. I want to see them having fun because I rarely get to see them having fun. We usually dont have fun because were not always together. One of my family membesr has to work and the other has to do something else. I really wished we could spend time longer together. I would go to Hawaii because I get to increase the relationship with my family and have fun.

528,976,B459B5B87707,"Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Dont they need any break. Even machines dont work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Doesnt the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you dont get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ? High school isnt just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face. Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesnt serve a purpose. If you cant have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Human beings dont need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day. More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell no sometimes. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools. Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school. In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. We hope to do so much but cant accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.",5,7,7,6,6,6,2427,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesnt wants to attend public school so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they dont have time to attend so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff. Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesnt like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they dont have time to go to the store and dont have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff but it can help you find an item that you dont know where it is without speaking to another person.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids dont have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie. Eating healthy is very important, because you wont have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it wont make you gain alot of weight.

Some peoples opinions can support your choice or can go against your choice. Getting other peoples opinion can help someone think of a better choice and make that choice more helpful to that someone. Why getting other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording. Having different opinions can make someone think of a better choice because people give that someone ideas of the choice theyre going to make. Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someones choice more beneficial and help someones way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldnt really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldnt be that make someone think of a better choice. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice. Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someones choice and make better choices. Having two or one opinion doesnt persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldnt really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she cant just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices.

536,3071,876CDA4D152D,"Do you think that all students have the capacity to commit to a career at a young age? In this paper I will argue about how students do not have the ability to commit to a career at a young age. Students shouldnt commit to a career, because they can change their mind, they are not good at only one thing or they dont want to do anything. A lot of people I know keep changing their mind, they are not ready to keep doing only one thing for the rest of their lives. My sister is an example: She is now almost about to finish her career but she wants to leave it because now she is interested in another thing. When she was in high school the career that she is in right now wasnt something that she wanted because she didnt like it, she does now, but she wants to do other things. For some people is not easy to stick with something, because they will keep changing their mind. Since I was young I wanted to do a lot of things in life. I cant commit to only one career because there is so many things that I want to do and like to do, for example: When I was 6 years old I liked playing the guitar, I still like to play the guitar but it is no something I want to to as a career. At 3 years old I loved to dance, it is something that I will always like to do but that is not something that I see myself doing for the rest of my life. And when I was 10 years old I started to draw, I started by drawing animals or any cartoon character, but now I draw whatever comes to my mind, however, it is not something I want to keep doing. Since there is not only one thing I like to do I cant commit to only one thing in life and If i do commit, later in life I will probably regret doing it. There are many students at my age that really dont want to do anything with their life or they dont have the ability do it. Some drop out of school because it is no something they are interested and probably its something they are not good at and give up. Most of them just want to stay home and do nothing. They stay at their parents house, which is not bad, but they stay there and do not look for any job. Some look for jobs but it is not something they like, it is something that is easy and can get them money to survive. Some say that all students can commit to a career, but they are wrong because not all students have the same mind sets as other students. At a young age not all students can do a career. In the future most of the students wont want to stick to only one career because they wouldnt only like one thing, so they should decide when they are ready and really know that the career that they are choosing will be the one that wont get tired of doing it.

They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more. One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and dont distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they dont listening to the teacher while shes explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she dont say anything when we are using our phones. Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read. Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they dont have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and thats one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i dont have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and thats why i dont do your homework. The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases. In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.",6,7,6,6,5,7,1440,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he wont be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy? All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired. Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that.

I mean if theyre eight-graders, they should be smart enough and decide on their own on what they want, or dont want to do. For me, I would choose helping the community, cause if you think about it, your actually doing it for your own goods, maybe in some points your not, but most of them from peoples personal experiments basically, your doing it for your community and your country, the world and people that are around you. What i would do, I would make a list from easiest, to hardest on helping the community, and start from the easiest because at first, your not used to it, and you need to learn how to be responsible for your things, and for what you do. For example, Ill pick, helping students in your classrooms. Then, I might start tutoring my cousins or neighbors, something to start of with, like a practice. If Ill see or think that Im good enough, I might move on, tutoring Elementary kids. Later on, Ill be a famous tutor! If Ill be doing a good job at tutoring, I might starting subbing for teachers, then theyll ask me to be a teacher! Which means, that now Ill have a job! So basically, I made my own personal carrier just for helping the community! What Im trying to say, helping you community isnt as bad.

542,3131,0CB1237268E3,"A positive attitude is the key to success, and everyone should agree at this point. People who choose to be in a successful way, always try to be positive toward every situation. Every person in this world wants to be something that could be remembered forever. To get to what they want to and dream about to achieve it, they must need to work hard, be prepared for everything, and always should be prepared for things that might be impossible to do but never give up on it at any issue. Life gets hard sometimes and gets easy by the time, but it depends on what people choose to live with. Those who choose to live happily works hard, always have positive attitude toward everything. But those who want to be successful but not working enough on it it will get nothing from it. people like ""George Washington"" who are still our heroes are the ones who knew how to get through tough ways by a positive attitude. We all have different habits, we are all different, but we can change the world through our positiveness, not by being mean and not pretend to be working hard for our needs and wants. Positive attitude the something that helps us get ride of our daily problems, doing something in a good way makes is a way to our goal becoming true with no tension. If we want to make our dream come true we have to make it in a good and positive way without hurting anyone, and by loving everyone. the only thing everyone absolutely have to know is that a positive attitude and thinking positive is the way we could get ride of our bad habits and live live in peace. We cant make it through our hard times if we just sit there and dont do what we should to ourselves and other needy people. We all have to be patient, not everyone gets stuff so easily, to achieve something it takes time but we all have to be prepared for things we will face. We might wont make it through in our first try, but we should never quit trying. Everything takes times and have its own limit to get fixed. There are two things that are above all else, one is work hard, and the second one is work hard in silence but in a positive and a good way. positive attitude is the important thing in our daily life. Its not that we have to be 100% so we could get all we want, we all know not everyone in this world is perfect so we have to do things by what we really could do, the only thing that would help us in everything is positive attitude. Nowadays everyone think they could do everything without trying the best they could, and try it in a positive way, but i think they are wrong. If you want to get the same respect s everyone else you need to have a positive mind toward every different thing in this world. Whenever things keep goes wrong we need to ask our selves that are we doing what we suppose to do, are we being what our parents and our country taught us to be, so that way we could stop thing to go from right to wrong and stay positive in every way. before we start to do something new we need to ask someone that is experienced, so we will not get lost in the middle. Never give up on anything in this world things are not hard, we are the ones who makes them difficult to do. We are not pot in this world for keep quitting things to get to our goal, we are here alive to create change in world, to love people, to love the tradition, to keep doing positive and effective things for our generation and the upcoming generations. We are born to make people smile. We are not for hate, we are for love. We all should be trying to change the negative thought to a positive thought. When we have problem to solve, we need to think twice and think positive because that solution would defiantly impact others too. We should all try hard to be in a metier type place. In my opinion everyone should be thinking about how to be successful, how to be something better, how to make others feel better, and make them pot him/her as an idol. we all should always take responsibility for our action and consequences. If you want to be something memorable you have to be the change what others would like in you, and you are the one who could make it through hard and tough ways by a positive attitude. We are the ones who can change the world by just be different and make things easy and effective in a good and positive way. I know we do not want the world to go for hate and negative way instead of a positive and right way with full of benefits. If we want to work somewhere and we dont have control on our bad behavior and have negative attitude towards the boss and other workers we will not be successful, but if we do have control on our positive and negative attitude we will always be successful and always would get promotion in every place we are.

Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving. Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work. Therefore, the work being produced was very productive. Praising a student builds their self esteem by making them feel good about the work that has been done. Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding. Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them.

Students not learn to much taking online class because they need to receive a good explication about the class, as real a teacher explains in the school. For example, if you are a student but you have questions and doubts, but the classes online or videos conferencing does not answer and give you good explications about the class. Would you learn while you are keeping in mind all your questions and doubts? Other reason is that students do not learn taking online classes from home because they get confusion, not understand the class and they give up when nobody help them. Would you able to do the right thing when there are not rulers taking a class? Electronics devices are the most powerful and useful tools that help us nowadays like cellphones, smartwatch and computers. However, many students are using electronic devices in the wrong way. For example, students that are taking online classes from home, they dont have rulers and they are using their phones to watch movies or texting with friends. This steal the students concentration, while they are taking the online classes. This can not happen during a normal day of school because teachers do not allows students to use electronics devices during class time. But students do not have the same rulers at home that teachers makes at school. This not benefit the knowledge of the students at home.

After eat you say, ""I want to go to the park,"" then, you, went to the park, so forged all about your lesson. Would you able to do the same during a normal day of class in the school? A teacher does not allows that a student left the school or to go to the park at the midpart of the class, while he is teaching because he wants to catch your attention to make you to learn more and morer. However, online classes or videos conferencing you can stop it and go or do whatever you want, then you lose knowledge abou it.

As Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"", I agree that if we always do something we accomplish more. We as human beings have so much potentials in us but we will never discover it through inactive. Firstly, I believe that inventions and new discoveries have made people more lazy and inactive. I dont blame Inventions and discoveries because they were made with good intentions and not through idle ism but there are people who trust inventions more then they have to. There is always something to do in this world; we accomplish more when we aim higher.

If a whole country can accomplish so much from not being lazy then imagine what a person can accomplish. I believe there are people who supports on being idle more that have to do work.

First,reason when something person loss manytime something and feel what if continue does again can obtain something good in the future. Because never said end. Second, reason the failure plays inthe life a paper strong in the life of every person in the world. But when any person not try more time that one is clear that is going to failure and never feel what is obtain something good in the futured. The decition every person have nothing can said what try againt. The decition is of your selft. My position is what if I whole my life said not and not continue consist in something never can obtain something. When have the oportunity of obtain something and gain something never say I failure least when have a enthusiasm of obtain. Never person have the right to says you never cant do. forever cave you personas negatives and thoght negative in the life. But every pesona have the right to attain something. For example: I have goals in my life what is gradution and have my diploma and can continue in the college. For can gain this gold and my dream i have enthusiasn and an person positive. Also if I have failure in my gold I have of up and againt. Form not failure has try more of one times. The reasons are clear if an have enthusiasm for something I loss the possible to go back to againt. I also think what the Prime Minister Winstor Churchill loss something for what the that try todo is what the person not continue there are and losss your enthusiasm for something what hill obtain. There are many success about failure but the failure arrive when the problem dont have solution. Becasuse also have the right to fight for obtain the solocion to the failure. When us arrive to the failure have the right of to do again but other form. Sometime the life us plays different suitation what think that not obtain solution but many pesons said what there are form all have solution lest when an dead. These is other example when one person dead and before to dead have failure many time in yours objetives an dont know say there are fight for obtain the solution. The life arrow as the world an never have the solution in the hand to all problems butnot signific what noy have solution. Never there are said not cant. The final of failure forever have solution. Is as when an company is goint to bankarrot. They try to share solution form the failure. For there nevere said that no cant share solution to the every failure.

552,3886,F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule? One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week. Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester. Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School. As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need. As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week.",8,7,6,7,7,7,3754,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I think we should ask people for there opinion because they might have a better thought. For example if you wanted to go shopping for cloths and you dont know which one to pick. People will give options of what they think and they can tell you which one they prefer more. There are variety options you can pick from. You can choose your own and ask people if they like it or not. If you dont know which one to pick between two options. You can ask friends, family, or anyone you feel comfuterble with you can get an idea which one you want more. Its always a good thing to ask for people opinion. Asking for people opinion is good they can have different options for you. You can ask on different flavor of ice cream you can get as many options as you want . People can give you differnt opionions on what they think which ice cream taste better than other ones. different options is always a good thing to use. Its bad sometimes haveing only one option the more options the better. The more options you get you wont have problems with picking things of what you want. It is easier to to pick and and you can have what you want. All these opinions can help us out later in life. In the future you might need help on which flavor ice cream is good. You can ask someone and they can give you an opinion which one is good. Its good to have opinion some of them you might not like. Everyone dont have the same opinion which is okay everyone can have different opinion on different types of things. over time you might need an opinion on something and you can thing what people have said before or you can ask someone to help you out. Different opinions and thoughts can help you more in life and you wont have problems with picking things. its good to have different opinions on different things that people give you. All these opinions people give you can help you later in the future and different kinda of opinions.

554,2414,3E1A0BAC4372,Sometimes knowledge is very helpful but sometimes imagination could be helpful to. When I was seven years old I imagined many things but they never happened. When I turned 13 years old things changed and they were not the same as I imagined before. I thought that I was gonna acomplish those imaginations in my head but they never did. One day I noticed that imaginations were not better than knowledge. One day my mom and I were suffering because we couldnt get to the other side of the river and we decided to build a boat to get to the other side and we made it. The knowledge we used was unexpected because we never thought we were gonna make it to the other side. Knowledge is very helpful when you are struggling with something but you also use imagination because you think before building or making something. I believe that imagination could be important sometimes but knowledge is more helpful and we use it very often. Imagination could change things but not better than knowledge. We might always think that imagination is better I agree with you but if you think of how easy it would be use knwoledge while you are struggling than you would understand the differences. Knowledge is very helpful in many ways and very often. I disagree with the prompt saying that imagination is better than knowledge. Always try something first and if it doesnt work try using something else. You will always find the solution on something different just like I did with my mom.

The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have. If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like. Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat. To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea.

And when we do that, the only one who will get hurt is us, if we are and behave exactly as we are may be there wont be too much people around us but that is not the most important accomplish, the most important accomplish is when we learn how to love our self and be who we are no matter if there wont be a lot of people surround us, if someone will loves me it has to love me for who I am not for who I pretended to be. Everyone in this world deserve to be love for who they are, no one needs to be someone else to be love or accepted , we have to stop trying to be someone else just to fit with a group of people because if youre not like them, then thats means that you dont belong to that place. Been who we are is what makes us special, there are no specifics forms that forces you how to be, pretending it wont make you happy. Just will make you feel that you dont deserve to be love, it will make feel desolate, it will make you feel that you are not funny as the rest of your friends. But when we learn how to be our self in this world where it constantly triying to make us feel or be someone else it is the greatest accomplishment, because when we know how love our self for who we are and how we look then we will be capable to love someone else for who they are not for who they pretend to be. Feeling like you dont deserve to be in this world is not the best feeling sometimes all you wanted to do is just go to a place where nobody knows you, where you want to start over again and do what you really love, be who you are and if someone gets to knows you it will accept you the way you are but something that we cant see is that we dont actually needs to go to the other side of the world to start over because we can try to start with our self, we have to start loving us the way we are. Why do you think that sometimes we feel desolate too? Do you think that is because we are been honest we our self? It is important to ask our self that question because it makes us think about our self for a minute and forget about the rest of the people about what they would think of me, most of the time we forgot about our owns feeling about how we gonna feel at the end if we do or behave the way that the society is asking us to do. And when we forget about our self that is the time when we feel desolate, and what can fill that what we think is missing? Is learn how to be our selves. If youre not funny as they want you to be or they might say that you have to be like the rest, thats not right because you will make yourself to a side and you will start been someone whos not you, someone you dont love but you have to be that way so you can be accepted and when that happen you are losing the greatest thing you have inside of you to give... Been who we are maybe it wont makes us see the perfect person in the world but it will make you happy to know that you have accomplish the greatest goal!

Example: If your attitude is bein positive, and you are being nice with tha person his going to be nice also, and yuo would have more posibility to get it.

Will it help you out and help you get a job that way, and is it important to set goals while your in high school and try to reach those goals in the future? All those questions are important to me because on my opinion those are ways to succeed in life. Those questions can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school clubs for it. Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if students know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience. Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future. For some people it isnt a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor. If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goals for yourself, and once you reach those goals set harder ones to reach. You can set many types of goals like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goals with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere. If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday.

Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or dont like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school. Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home.

The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that dont like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot. These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work.

I was a little girl with a lot of energy, goals and really confident about myself, I enjoyed being in presentations, ceremonies or anything about being in front of the public. I kept growing, and a lot of people thought that I was going to forget about all this crazy dream to be in TV, but it wasnt like that, my interest was increasing more and more; I was still in my country, Generic_City, when I went for my first time to a news channel, the principal of my school in that moment selected me to make a commercial about a festival that we had, Im not going to lie, I was scared and really nervous, but once I touched the microphone, I forgot all my fears, the employees of that place were so surprised, they told my teacher, ""how a 13 years old little girl can have a lot of talent? The way that she speaks make It see it so natural and easy to do it"" I would never forget those words, because It was there, when I realized, that all this was for me, ever since that one day, my principal asked me to do all the commercials for the school. Two years later I had to move to a different school, and I had a big surprise, this school had way more opportunities to be successful in this area; the owner of the school saw my potential in the way I speak, and yes, he asked me to do every ceremony and commercials during the whole school year. But that was not enough for me, I wanted to learn more, so I stared to used professional cameras and make homemade videos to practice a little big more; that same year my family decided to move to the United States. I was really sad, no only for my family and friends, also, I didnt know If coming to America would change my dream, everything was different, traditions, school and most important, the language. This change was not going to change what I like to do, I stared taking this class called: ""TV and Media Production"" and I felt like coming back to home, everything that I love to do, was right there, I learned how to editing videos, how to record professionally and take all I know, to a whole different level; couples moths in this country and I already had the opportunity to being in different news channels,video for the school and they loved how I did it, and I dont have to think a lot to know that this is what I want to as a career.

Because the importance of having a good attitude is to never doubt yourself that you cant do it when all you have to put is work. Working hard is most of the common things you can do to pass High School and College. Then you start searching up for things that youre interested to do after you finish college like a job which you have to have a positive attitude to pass the interview and treat customers good. Positive attitude will change your life forever. One, Having a positive attitude will get you anywhere. You want to have a good image that its positive. You have to be hopeful and confident about the future. In many places is hard to find a good successful job, which all you have to do is have good attitude in front of the manager and if you get it keep your head up always dont let that ruin you. For example, their is a lot opportunities for a good successful job, but you have to keep working hard until you get what you wanted. Two, Feeling good about yourself is sometimes what you need to have success. If its necessary to take away people to have good feeling about you is good so you can focus more on want to do in life. You are the only person that can control yourself or behavior. Take little five minutes to think and prove to yourself that you can do it without any help. For example, If you dont like Monday mornings all you have to do is reflect a positive thought on your mind that will make you happy the rest of the day. Three, Show your best work by doing right thing in life to success. If you have you head up always and sometimes you need to think is good for yourself which make you a better person my reflecting a good image. Be honest to yourself and never take life for granted. Is important that you have a good positive attitude by doing this stuff which will led you to a good successful career. For example, You have a big interview that is gonna require a lot hard work cause this can define your future and you want to be successful in life overall if you pass and have all the techniques you need youre good then, but if not then you will keep trying until you get it right. I agree that positive attitude is the key of success in life. In this life you can be whatever you want,but all you have to do is work hard. Have a positive mind set and positive attitude this will led you to have a good things in life. Have faith on yourself to get back what you want. The success dont come along in just one day you have to keep working hard to reach the top and have what you always wanted.

574,1041,24DAF94F0A18,"I am sure my heart is raising that I saw a lot of people behavior is going bazaar! Then it is said that your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because it creates trust, shows that your helping others, and creates a positive big impact on others. Your own behavior creates trust is to show that other can respect you and care about you. Friends behavior creates trust because they will sometimes help others. For example, if i have a huge injury and I cant walk, then probably theyll know that Im not joking around and Ill trust them to help me. Another person behavior that creates trust is teachers, their behavior is mostly positive and always influence others. Theyll always care about helping their student and makes the student trust the teacher what they need help on. Even though students think that teacher dont trust them, but others think teachers have faith on others to try hard to help and let them work hard for the future. Also, families creates trust so they will always have influence on me. It like i made their personality more positive than before. Your own behavior creates trust because of helping others, having positive personality, and increase better relationship on others. Showing that you help others is another way to influence other people from your own behavior. Sometimes my families help others and they will never forget about us. Like all of our family went to Generic_City and went on a mission to help others, like we build houses or feed a lot of poor people with food that we made. Another person that help others is friends, they always help me if im in a stress zone. They always comfort me feel better when Im upset or mad. Also, teachers help other because they want the students to past the school. Although some of them might fail, yet teachers try their best to let them past. They want them to try hard so teachers need to make them work hard and help them learn. Like my teachers will try their best to help me past my quizzes or test. Helping others is the best way to influence people like friends, teachers, and families that they will support you and others what they need. The reason why your own behavior creates a big positive impact of others. So more and more people will show respect and will mostly love you. This will create a big positive impact on friends because I show love for them and they will probably love me back. All of us should always show love and care so that they wont hate you. For families, they always have a positive impact because of others positive attitude. Showing a good attitude can be like walking the bridge to their heart. This can help their feeling be better and better. Another person that have a big impact on others is firefighters. They always care about others and their lives so they always protect them when theyre in trouble. There was one story that these firefighters that they need equipment because their tools is rusty and broken, but one person called them for help so they came the house was on fire and the wife is still trapped. So they got her out and she is save. So the husband so so proud, and send them 2,000 dollars a month so the firefighter can bye the equipment. This it to show how much the husband care about them. So this can create a big positive impact because of showing love, fixing feelings, and having risk to protect. Other might say that your own behavior can affect others. It has said that you own be behavior can influence other by showing that you help others create a positive big impact, and creates trust. We should see if others behavior can influence others and change the world. ",6,5,6,6,5,6,486,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Some people say its a negative effect on people because all they do is use their phone when they need something, instead of going out getting fresh air or hanging out with friends. People that are constantly on their phones can cause them depression, because all they do is sit at home, and the phone provides them everything. it can also draw you away from friends and can be a distraction at school It also can be a positive effect because you get to text your friends, for example example if a friend moved out of state you would still have contact with them. its also easier to do homework, or you can read a book online instead of going to the library and getting one. ""Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others"" in that quote it says that you can finish a task without having contacts with people, how is someone suppose to have social contacts with people? how do you learn new things or new meet people? Thats why technology can be bad for someone people. For example when Im on my phone all day cause im sick or stayed home from school I get bored being on my phone all day, yes the phone is useful but it doesnt help staying in your room all day watching a movie or a show, you dont get to learn anything. Talking to people and having social contact is sometimes better, you learn a new word or a new fact each day, but theres some negatives in all of it, you can lose close friends because you get distracted on your phone and you dont listen to what they have to say. Theres a lot to do beside staying at home and being on your phone, you can go out and get lunch with friends instead of sitting at home and eating alone. I know a few people that dont have many friends, so they are usually on their phones a lot, you can see the difference, people that are on their phone a lot and just sit at home dont really know how to act in public. People sometimes dont like going out and trying new things because they got used to being on their phones. In conclusion technology is a negative effect on people because it doesnt allow them to see whats outside of their phones. They tend to just use their phones when sometime its better if they talk to their friends in person. Using your phone can take you away from your friends and it isnt a good thing.

582,3585,344D7B1A7E49,"I agree with Emersons statement. Why would some people never grow up? Some people may have childish personality so its most likely that the person wont be able to change much. The three reasons are: your attitude, violence, and lastly friends that some people are using you and say some harsh things when your not around. Some may say that some people will be able to change. They are wrong because some people wont be able to change how they act towards you. My first reason is attitude: some people wont be able to change to change your attitude towards them, and wont be able to change how you act towards them. For example, I sometimes have a very bad attitude towards my sister, Generic_Name. I always yell at my sister, Generic_Name for asking me to do something or give her something even though shes younger than me by three years. My second reason is violence: Some people wont be able to change their violence, and some people my end up hurting their closest friends. For example, back in middle school I was always a sweet girl who doesnt hurt people, but after, when I cut my hair some people end up calling me names which made me upset and I started to get a little violent towards the people who call me names. Im still sweet towards my friends who understands how I feel when someone call me names, but I also try very hard to control my violence so I wont get in trouble. The second example is: My youngest sister, Generic_Name gets violent when my other sister, Generic_Name gets her angry. Afterwards, she tries very hard not to get violent just like me. My last reason is friends: Some people wants to use you for money because they wanted to buy clothes only for themselves. The other one is some people will act nice, but, when you leave they will say very cruel things to you. For example, I watch my favorite movie where the popular, mean girls are acting friendly to the new girl, but when the new girl leaves the popular, mean girls say harsh things about her so the new girl wont be able to hear them. In conclusion, why would some people never grow up? The way the person is acting childish would make them not change that much. I agree with Emersons statement, because some people can be very childish, and its most likely wont be able to change that much. The three reason are: some people have a very bad attitude, sometimes get very violence, and lastly some people may use you and say very cruel things about you when your not there.",7,8,7,6,6,8,678,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Lets to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills! What do to improved our talking/people skills, its important to get feedback from others and you dont even know when you need it of not. Like heres an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and doesnt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and its always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But its hard when you are nervous. How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why Im telling you this its because I dont want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more. Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future. Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that its important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think its better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion.

Nobody like to do something that they dont want it, they have their own chose of life decisions on what they want to be or what they want to do. However, some of the decisions they may have are hard way or easy way, the hard way is they have to try hard in life: study so you can have a good grade and work hard, the easy way is they have to put stuff or money on the first start of they future decisions, is a short way but is really hard and not all people can make that decisions depend on if they want it or not. Also depend on where they at in life for a example: people have alot of money the way they want their decisions on future is more short because they dont worry about other thing tact or payment and people are not have alot of money the way they start their future decisions are more longer because they have to worry about alot of money tact, payment, pay for their car,... also they have a to work more extra hard for they decisions. I meet a friend, he was go to school and work in the same time he was about to out of high school and go to collenge but he maked a bad decision on his life, he about to out of high school but he stop and he said to me that ""go to work are making more money than go to school"" so he stop school, his job now is doing nail that job do sometime do alot of money and sometime dont and he dont want to try more hard, he can go to collnge and later on got a good job make more money than Nail but lose that chance and it change his live forever now he cant take it back.

588,1285,144671E445D0,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote ""Do you think that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control?"". Well some people believes we choose our own character traits or influences by our control. Other people doesnt agree that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control. I think that we choose our character traits, or our character is formed by influences beyond our control because were doing things that maybe enjoy doing, or we get to choose what we want to be. And I am going to talk about this and why I agree on this. I Agree that we get to choose our character traits or formed by influences beyond our control because you get to do anything when it comes to you becoming what you wanna be. Another reason is that no one can control you on how you should be later on in the future. I also think that doing the things you like to do would change you for example, helping people that are in need will make you a better person because youre controlling yourself on what you are doing. Another example is that if youre doing bad things, it would make you a bad person because of your actions. Thats why people think we change our character traits by choosing our own or formed by influences from our controls. Other people doesnt agree that we can change our own character traits or formed by influences from our controls because they think it cannot change their own character traits from the actions they do. Also many doesnt believe that doing what they wanna do wont change them later on in the future. Another reason is because they dont believe that we cannot choose our own character traits and that it should only be 1 trait about yourself. For example doing something positive wouldnt effect them because they can easily change and do something negative later in the future. Last thing is that they dont think we get to choose our own traits and basically say that we are born the way we are without changing our character traits. This makes me think if people who doest believe that they can change their character traits or controlling their influences can be a bad thing for them. the reason why i think its a bad thing is because they dont think they cant change the way they act with actions they do normally. For example, they think doing positive actions would not change their character traits. Changing your character traits can make you a better person because of the positivity you are spreading. if you spread positivity or have a good mindset could change your character traits. So in this essay i believe that people can change their character traits or formed by influences beyond our control. I say this because you can choose what you wanna be or act later on in life. Another reason is any actions people can do also makes them change their character traits. This is very good if you treat others with respect; you will be a positive person. This will also help you in life because if you think down you wouldnt be motivated, but you can change that by doing something nice to yourself or to someone. That will give you a good mindset and want to do it more often if it helps you feel motivated by making someones day .",5,6,6,4,5,5,278,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

People know, is the biggest goal to be better day by day and be the good example for a future family.

There is going to be bad moments in the journey but that does not mean that we are done, we have to be positive and think positive, because for everything there is a solution.

Back in my country Bolivia the mayority of old people said that you have to be resourceful if you want to get what you want. I am agree with this statement. In my opinion, I believe that people have to try to make something else to accomplish their goals because people dont trust themself, people dont take second chance, doesnt matter the time. To begin with, most of people do not trust themself. There are people that think that can not do it, but they are wrong because if you propose something to yourself you have to work on it, you have to be a positive person if you want to persevere. You most have to trust in yourself. For example, my older brother never trust in himself, he always says what about if I do this and it no gonna work, he was negative, he always had negative thoughts, he never tries make something else to get on top of his goals or what he wants. But one day my grandma talked to him. My grandma told him that he has to try even though things are hard, if he want to accomplish his goals he had to try to make something else to achieve his goals. Secondly, there are people that dont take second chance to get on top of their goals. The 60% of people when they have something done, they dont like the result so they dont want to do it again because they did ones so they dont want to do it twice, they think that they gonna get the same result. For instance, in my situation, I used to ignore the secod chance because I thought that if I did one time and it wasnt that great so is gonna be the same the second time, but I was wrong. Hence, it wasnt like that,so what I trying to say is that is essential to try, try, and try, My mom always says dont be scared to do it, the thing that are worth it isnt eassy you have to try and give your best. In addition, many people said you must have to try something else it doesnt matter the time. There are people that doest care how many time they try something, to get in their goals. The just think that they want to accomplish their dreams. For example, my best friend Generic_Name always says dont worry about the time you have to get what you want, you have to accomplish the things that you porpuse yourself take the advantage of the time. To sum up, as you can see if you want to accomplish your goals you have to try different things. Just try keep in youjr mind that the ones who work in what they want they to achieve. Manyh people may think why people should try twice, but thats not the point. The point is that you have to keep going and try your best to get your goals.

Some schools have a program that pairs older students and younger students. I think that a program like that will be helpful. The older students are available to assist the younger students. This program can be helpful, to both the older and the younger students, because both the younger and older students, can learn new things from their opponent, or classmate. Also is fair that the older students assist, the younger students, so both of them can be sucessful. Like maybe the younger students can teach the older students, some new skills theve learned in school, or somewhere else. Or maybe how theyve learned to play baseball or softball. The older students can teach the younger students, how to do algebra / solving equations or how to ride a bike. Helping out younger students helping order students can be fun and can also turn out to be great. Or sometimes bad. Like for example, in my school, they have a club that both younger and older students can be in. It is free and not obligatory. So me and some of my friends, joined that club. And also some othe r students. Some of the older students, helped us, if we needed help, and we also helped them if they needed help. Every time during that club we each bring our own snacks or the teacher gives us some snacks himself, and we get to work. That club at school was so helpful for me and my friends, because we can get our homework done in time, and some older students or adults assist us if we need help. Me and my friends also enjoyed that club because it was fun at certain time. In conclusion, pairing older students , with younger students, can be very helpful to certain people in need.

Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that youre not capable to become your dreams reals. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success. I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. We all passed through that situation , you feel like youre not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isnt a rainbow its a very mean and nasty place and it doesnt matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it doest care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I cant be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody. Thats how winner is done. In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher. In addition to this, you have to be able to hold out the criticisms of others, if you are not capable your enthusiasm will get shrink and all the effort would be vainly.",6,4,5,5,4,7,2564,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble. When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didnt check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it. Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she couldt sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didnt our parents. Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good. Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble.

The school can provide us too, some career to start doing and learning what they want to be in the future. The bond more important in this life is the school, because can show us find our real self. The school can provide to be success on life, and can prepare to get better education. The school provide us to be success on life on different way. The school is really good fundamental step, to teach us what the student want to be on the future and prepare for it. For example two year ago I meet a friend on Cuba who never went to school, he always been saying I dont want my expend my time on the school, when i can work and make really good money. For this moment is really good, because he dont has bill to pay, but after that he grow up. When he has to pay his own bill, and the money is not enough. So his Mon always been saying to him please Generic_Name go to the school, so one day he took the world to his Mon and for this he start to going to school again to the normal person. Generic_Name try to be success on the life and help his Mon what she need doing the right thing. So he never give up and he study hard to graduated. So he complete his goal and now he study doctor on the university, and making good money. This is a really good example to never give up and always need to follow our step no matter what. The school can prepare the student to get more education . Basically the student past more time on the school than the house, its considered to us to the second house.

The education the school bring to us are really important to find our self and to build our goal.

After a while the time came and he had to learn and try when he tried he filed and filed couples times in till he be came a successful . me in person filed couples times in all SOLS but I had fix and I kept trying and trying in till pass all of them. at the same time it might be a bad thing because some of us when they fail they give up so easy.

600,902,03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so. Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you. Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when youre a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way. In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents. So yes, I think people should make there own decisions.",7,7,8,7,8,8,44,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
601,928,07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?"" When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up. When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When Im sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher. When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones. When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school. Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that. Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing.

But the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. So I believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. People is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions. My first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why theres too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming. In my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person. People is always criticizing so if you dont want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too. For these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you. Also you will feel proud of yourself that your are influencing other in a right way.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a Author who believe to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I agree with that statement but not so many could say the same. There is many human on this planet who cant accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self . Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brain washes people to be someone else than being their self. Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. Their is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out who you really are. Than they might not like who you really are then your feelings are hurt . Therefore your friendless and hurt ,But you could always pick yourself up by being yourself. Than by over time people will start to notice how you change and they will want to have relationship with you. Its healthy to have relationships with you being yourself than being someone else. The reason why i am saying that is because you dont want to be lying to the other person the whole time during the relationship .

609,3882,16C794A0F479,"students should not be allow to use their cellphone during class time only if it is necessary or with the teacher permission. One of the most important reason why you should not be allow to use your phone during class is because the cellphone really distract you, it may be because youre playing, text ting or listening music. Cellphone can be a big distraction for the student for to many reasons, sometimes students do not really think like that, but on my opinion it is a big distraction, using the cellphone during class can make you miss important parts from the class that you may need for a future test that maybe one of the answer can be that small part that you didnt hear because you were on your phone, but the teacher is not the responsible from your actions, you take your own decisions,and you choose the decision to look at your phone than pay attention at class. in other parts teachers should make that their rules for the classroom has appraisal, and make the students respect them, or if the teacher cant do that at least the school can make that rule. Some times youre just pretending that you are paying attention, but youre not really paying attention for the reason that you may be at your phone or answering a text, i am saying this because it happened to me and i do the same, i know some students has the same situation and others that cant live without their cellphone. it can be addictive. some times I think it can because the age, we are just young persons and some persons think different they really come to study but others just come because they have to. The effects of being using the cellphone at class are that you not really pay attention at class and you fail the class. cellphones are not necessary at class and its not educational or helpful for you to remained or learn things. On my person i fail classes because the same situation, i fail classes and if i fail classes ill fail the school year and then wont would like to repeat other school year. That gonna make me think about that and i dont would like to come to school because i feel like i loose my time coming to school to repeat it every single day. i think cellphone make you stupid and act like a dumb because when youre on your phone, you are like in other world, you dont pay attention on what is happening around you. you are loosing time from your life time that you can use study or do others necessary and important things for your life. i see students that they just dgf and they on their phone during class, im one of them, lol. On my opinion, cellphone can be necessary some times, but i dont really need it during class because i come to study, take notes and do my best in class for have good grades, i will say that cellphone can be use only during test, classwork because i am that kind of person that likes to be listening relax songs and doing my job. in other way schools gives you a laptop and i think the only thing where you can do all of those things is the computer, i can use Google or YouTube, its not necessary to have your phone on your hands. How can we solve this issue? teachers should collect all cellphones before start class, and make a rule that something gonna happen if he/she see someone with their phone, so students may have to respect this rule. All this conversation i think the problem is not cellphone, i think the problem is technology because humans are depending from technology and and it makes them fool, todays technology can be more smart than a person. if you really read to this side you should understand how is life now, you may be older and smarter than i am, but we both lived different generations, it is all my decisions, we have to control technology not technology has to control us. legalize ;)",6,6,6,6,6,5,313,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The work in group is more better then work alone, in the beneficial is the student work in group is have more opportunity of learn more with other students in the class, they can work more better and understand more quickly the theme in the class and have more collaboration, learn to respect other students. They in the group can say new ideas for the team. I think in the personal the work in group is more productivity in the student because have a good communication with the students and teacher, they have more positive attitude in the ideas and participation. For example, students in the group work more and learn more quickly because in group have a higher quality of ideas, and students can change ideas together about the theme in the class and have a better determination in the job of the class. Second, work in group have a big benefit in the class because students understand problems more quickly, and they have solution in theme complicated with ideas and dedication in class. Third, students have collaboration with other students have a good relation and learn to respect others person for religion or ideas. They have more communication in the class and have more better grade in the school. However, work alone not have good result because almost all the student have fear to say ideas for the critic of other students in the class, and they have slow work in the class for complication of the theme. The preference is work with a group have more benefit in the student and teacher to learn and teach other students in the school have more communication, better work and good relation in the school. sincerely Generic_Name ",6,5,6,5,4,5,3652,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

It would be fun to work at the police station because you can travel to different countries and cities you have never been to. Therefore, you can explore from above when riding a air plane and you can meet different people. Also experience of what type of cultures people do in their country. Working at the police station would be cool and super fun because I can work on fun cases, involving to ride different vehicles or going undercover and going places. Just imagine your manager assigned you to go to Korea and you stayed there for a few years. You have made new friends and learned the Korean language. You had to take Tae Kwan Do and you made it to black belt. However you still work with the U.S. police. And you also observe of what they do in Korea, for example, how they harvest rice and at what type of climate they need to be in or how the people eat their food and how younger children greet the older men and women. Also experience what people do in their specific culture and what laws they follow and things they need to respect. And also how they sell to get money. Also working with police means you are not alone, you have teammates with you. They can also help you on cases that can be dangerous. Your teammates can be helpful and fun because they can help make wise decisions and on something risky, like you have their back and they have yours. They can also be help and caring/fun when you are stressed out and they try to make you feel better or trying to comfort you and not making you feel lonely. For example, On one Sunday morning you felt sick and a strange feeling you had something missing. You ate breakfast and you remembered you needed to finish on one of your assignments your manager had gave you. you felt even more sick. All day you tried to erase the fact that you didnt complete you assignment, you tried to throw that thought away, but you couldnt. You wanted to not even think about and wishing the thought could just disappear. You felt like brain was rotting for thinking too, much. You called you best friend ( that also worked at the police station:) because you wanted some company. When she entered your apartment, she saw that you werent in the living room. She went to your bedroom noticed that you had been eating junk food all day because you had lots of your favorite corn chips and an empty box of pizza beside you. Just then she started to stare at you, and you were reaching for a bucket of your favorite ice cream, strawberry. She looked at you and saw that you scooped a spoonful of ice cream and you shoved it into your mouth, with your TV on. (You were watching the Titanic with the lights off because you felt sad and had nothing to do) She went up to you and hugged you and asked what has happened to you and why you were feeling down. You told her why you were so miserable and guilty for not finishing your assignment. She stoop up and told you that she was going to help you. You also stoop up lazily, but you felt excitement. You went to go change and finished the assignment on time.

Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them. First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and dont want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You cant miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and thats your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities. Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year thats when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or dont have a ride and you cant get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you dont understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you dont feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who dont know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them. Lastly, some people dont want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they dont want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they dont do anything because they think that they dont have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they wont miss that much work. Thats why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you dont miss anything or be left behind. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

The reason that i think being active is better, Is because you will get accustomed to always do something and that can help you in your future in your homework, house duties, and in your future job; and i know that being idle does not help you to grow as someone that is uses full to the society, because one of my cousins does absolutely nothing and he start to get into a lot of problems with our family. If you are always active you are showing to the people that you are someone they can count on, someone that demonstrate, values like determination, and responsibility; and most of the time people are looking for does type of people to manege a work place, food store,school,and companies. I also think that active people are more likely to be successful,I am sure that it is true because my father star to work when he was only 9 years old and he was always doing something, and then whit the time he reach to be his own boss doing what he like but never stop doing the duties that he give to himself make him a really responsible person; and that why i think that person how are always active have more potential to succeed. The reason that idle people are not going to get anywhere for me is because most of the time people are looking for somebody with energy and wants of work and if you are one of the people how are always on the sofa watching television i am sure that you wont be the first choices for them. In conclusion the reason why i chose the people that are active make more accomplishment in they daily life is because that have more opportunities to show to the word that they are here and that they want to be seen and they want something to do and do it better and that they can reach their goals.",6,6,6,7,5,5,2668,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
619,2969,CD9FDD5F9F9E,"Does failure play a big role in success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that, ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although failure often just ends up in failure, I agree with Winston Churchills statement that failure can lead to success if people continue to use enthusiasm. First of all, many of our inventions used today are a result of failures. For example, Edison created the lightbulb, but failed many times before he discovered electricity. He used his faith and motivation to not give up and keep trying even though he had many set backs. He accidently made a circular shaped like glass ball which became a source of electricity. If Edison did not keep trying, we would not have electricity today. Also, many scientists have created medicines after many failed attempts. For instance, there is now a chicken pox shot that prevents people from getting the chicken pox. Through many experiements with mixure of chemicals and failed trials, scientists were eventually able to find a shot that prevents chicken pox from entering your system. These examples show that failures often lead to success if people never give up trying. Second of all, many students have failed in school, but if they keep trying and keep their enthusiam, they will succeed. For example, I have had a hard time in school, especially with passing my sols. When time goes on, I try harder and harder, and spend more time studying with my teacher. As of today, I have passed all of the sols I need in order to graduate except for the one I am writing about right now. I also have a learning disability and ADHD and have a hard time paying attention and often lose focus in my classes. Even with my disability, I have not given up and keep coming to school and get extra help from my teachers so that I can graduate this year. I make sure I follow the rules, dont skip class, or dont miss school becuase its so hard for me to make up what I miss. Although many seniors like to skip class, I do not skip becuase I want to earn a high school diploma. Even in education, there are failures, but through hard work and a good attitude, students can succeed. In conclusion, I agree with Chruchills statement ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of entusiasm."" Even though people will experience failures, there will be success if they work hard, keep the enthusiiasm, and never give up.

620,969,D87F1B0CE93F,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others. I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too. An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment. Inactivity doesnt serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you cant change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you cant do much for them. By not being active accomplishments arent being met rather someone else doing it. Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Never attempting to do something is bad. Always try your best even if you feel like you cant. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Things can get done if we are always doing.

I agree with Waldo Emersons quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I wasnt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends wont try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you dont think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that didnt last. Now im in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, cant stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her.

622,3539,3498E7E2DAB6,"In the principals office there is quote stating that "" your life can be beneficial if your doing something very productive, because it can lead you to great success in life"" In some way we ask ourselves if we are do something with our lives and be thinking ahead on what we want to do with our life and what can take us to success. Is that true?. Its more than just having something to do. Life is very short, As long as you are doing something with success. Living is an option as well as just giving up and not trying very enough. Accomplishing something in life to any dream you want to have. If you dont try as hard in life, you will never succeed and imagine all those who gave up and thinking... Where they are now?. Living life can only be chosen just by you and its only your choice to think in what direction you want to take. Although some may believe that life,belief, and hope prove that doing something with your own future can accomplish and lead you to a successful life. Your life can be turned around very quick, if only you are doing something very little that makes you happy and know that sticking with it, can take you anywhere you want in your future just only by trying and not giving up on your own self. Not trying and thinking way ahead of your own future can bring yourself down which can lead you to depression, low self of esteem , and as well of not having very much hope. In human society it has been discovered that in most of our population much as 40% of our people in the U.S are unemployed and dont have anything to do which leads them to go down in their life. There is so much poverty going on in this world and just by thinking about it and you think to yourself and say what did they do wrong in life that brought them to were they are now?. Your future can be so easy as long as you try and have hope in your own self. Just by knowing that you have accomplished anything in life can lead your own way to success. Your future can only be held in your hand no one else. Like its said once life can only chosen due too live a long term of time or short period of time its all held under your back, your shoulders, and your own self future. Being successful life is very important to your life having many accomplishment can make your self feel very motivated and make it very good. You can make your life very easy and not to hard just as long your are doing something that makes you happy and also as long what right direction you are taking and what good path is in your way. Life isnt easy either, it can be very difficult just as long as your trying at your very best and your pushing yourself into having great success, you will be at your very best and the top est you can be. The choice you make, can make it very effectively on you and it can change anything. The make key in life is as well having much belief on your own future or in life. Belief can only be happened by you and no one else, It can be very good and at its best just as long your try and making your life not to difficult. Having belief isnt bad at all its just a feeling you have on yourself and that the feeling makes it good for just for yourself and no one other. Every person in the world is very different in their way, everyone isnt the same in the way you see or in the perspective you think in. In society each person can think any type of way they want and they only problem is that you should be only be worrying about yourself but no other. There has been many issues due too how you believe and what others think about you and get to worried about it. Our world shouldnt be like that, in our belief we should stay positive in each one of us and stay motivated in any situation you go through. The belief in come in any one and whoever think in the mindset of way, we can all go through difficult times and not have any belief in ourselves. But only yourself can change no other can do that for you. The accomplishment in life can mean allot in yourself and can also have no good beneficial idea just for you, but something you can also do is give a big impact in human society. In setting a good state of mindset can change you very completely, another word to help yourself could also be hope. Having hope could lead you very far in life and also having great accomplishments that can also lead you to a big success. If you cant see it but others can see how your life is being impacted on you not doing something with your life. Only you can change that, but as others cant. Another key to life is hope. It can take you very far and also lead you in any direction yourself takes or as well in any path you want. Having hope is an option and a belief you want or can have. Not every person has hope or believes in themselves because all they want too do is fail. Others can see you fail and not try, but it is very hard for you to see yourself. In life if you have it can lead too do good things in life and have great accomplishments that no other has, just by having good hope. Just know to yourself that having hope can lead yourself to great victory and a great life that no other can have but you. In those who dont believe that if are doing something isnt an accomplishment to success, which that takes my position in saying that themselves thinking that is wrong. Because a key to success in life is having many accomplishments and lead you very far. But in those who also say that being inactive is a way too success is also wrong on their point of view and isnt a true fact statement. Inactivity cant take you too far in life and isnt a beneficial success to life. Having anything to do that you enjoy can lead too good accomplishments and also great success. Having a great life,hope, and belief can take you very far and lead you to any direction or path you want to take. Any one can have a great life just as long as you try. Life is easier as long you make it a success. ",5,6,6,7,4,6,683,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
623,1726,E88DDF2C81EB,I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving a good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too. I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Names team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play. On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad. over all positive attitude is the key to success. Whenever we dont fell like we are having negative energy we should ask and understand that it could get worse. By positive altitude we could get more that we lose if we are having negative attitude.,7,7,7,7,7,6,3370,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
624,3408,87694700310E,"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you. For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something youd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, theres always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because its totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain cant erase. Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. Its fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesnt want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it. In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.

I would spend all day on the beach and most of the night on the amazing board walk. When I would spend the day on the beach I would ride the big waves on my stomach even tho it hurts but its still fun. Also, I would go boggy boarding because its hard to stay on if you dont time when to jump on the wave right, I would usually bring my own board from home but the waves are so strong mine would brake and I would always have to buy a new one over there. My all time favorite thing to do is play on the sand when I to tired of being in the water for too long. I would usually build a long and tall sand castle then run throw it and get my mom mad because I just got sand all over her. Then my dad would dig a big whole in the sand then put me in it while my brother holding me down my dad would cover me with sand so that just my head would sick out, they would usually leave me in there for about 20 minutes or so With this in mind, at night I would love going on the board walk and explore all the cool places. Most night there would be a band playing outside next to a Sonic fast food outdoor restraint and they would have a game where people can win two free meals if you guess how many Jolly ranchers are in the jar. Then me and my dad would rent bikes and ride all around the board walk for like an hour or so to see everything that is there. Once it hits like 10:30 my brother, sister, and I would go on the sand and find cool stuff on the ground with flash lights then we would all sit down, listen to music and talk for about two hours.

If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online. Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you cant do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you cant at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you cant at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldnt you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes its a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also its boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers. I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they cant keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally dont think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what its like. Therefor I dont think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing.

628,1768,C71E90669DFA,"Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Dukes statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it. My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again. Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know whats the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and dont create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we cant make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life. My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other.

630,2489,19D55405175F,"Imagination and knowledge are very inportant parts of us. Albert Eistein said,"" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Im on debate on whether I agree or not, so maybe this will help me decide. In my opinion, I believe that imagination and knowledge go hand and hand. Theres many reasons on why I believe this, but due to the character limitation, Im only going to name a few reasons. One of the first reasons I believe this is because of discovery. When someone goes out on a new adventure, they can only imagine on what they can find. When they do find something new, they use their imagination to find out what it can do, what it haas inside, or what does it do for the enviroment. Once they do figure out somethinng about it, they get the knowledge from it. Its honsetly cool on how much we know because of our imagination. Another reason on why I believe this way is because of what we created over the past years. Weve created so many wonderful things and a few mistakes over the past years. When sommeone wants to invents something, they use their imagination and knowledge of the world around them to make it. If you want a job on where creativity has no boundries, then you should become either an animator or a game developer. I choose to be both, but mostly being game developer. When someone get inspired to make someone, they use the knowledge of their inspiration and their own imagination to create something wonderful or a mistake that should never been released on this world. I honestly do that too. Ive takeen the knowledge from the games and animations I liked to come up with something in which I hope many people will injoy. Theres plenty more reasons that I cant really come up with but Im sure that you get my point. Imagination and knowledge work together to improve this world as we know it. Prime examples of this are discovery and creativity. If everyone can use these two things together, Im sure that well come up with something wonderful or something thatll most likely mess up the planet forever.",7,8,8,8,7,8,345,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

635,3100,791AF7B78178,"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years? They would have to take more classes in less time: Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because thats what this prompt says. It will be more stressful: As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. Ill say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOLs test will be taking in less time, Im not saying that those people wont have enough time to study, but what Im saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them. The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldnt be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it wont be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",6,7,6,7,6,7,1588,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

However, some say school shouldnt offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home because students wouldnt get enough knowledge at home, its better in school. Actually, students should be able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. First, Online is useful in many ways. Students can research the information, or students can watch video on YouTube. For example, Math, some students dont understand how to solve the equations, but they can watch the video and find more math learning. Also, English essays. last year, my English teacher told me to write an essay about the night by Eli Wisely. I researched him because I didnt know who he was at first, and I found his history in the holocaust, I read it. It was very tragedy. So, I wrote it down for project, and I found a lot information in the holocaust. It was useful finding information on Google. Second, video conferencing is helpful. There is a website called Edubirdie. This website is use for teachers communicating with students for education. Students can spend time with teacher like 24 hours or depends on what time students chooses. Edubirdie helps students with essays, math problems, social studies, science, etc.. Also, I remembered when I had a final exam for chemistry, and the problem was I didnt learned anything from chemistry class. Because my teacher was horrible, I didnt learned anything from him. So, I searched to Edubirdie website and watched some videos of stochiometry problem and word problems. Then, I face timed a Chemistry teacher from Edubirdie. I spend like 10 hours with her. It helped me little bit. After that, I took the final exam and I barely passed the class with the D+. at least I passed the class and Im happy with it. In conclusion, schools should offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because it gains knowledge and helpful for future education.",7,7,7,8,6,7,3886,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
638,2709,05CE0C0C5102,"Is it a good idea for student to finish high school in three years? Well I think that if student take three years to high school is that they know what they want to do in their life. Those student either want to go to college early, go the the work force, or start something from their passion. I am going to talk about three things of what I think about this prompt. Those things are students knowing they want to do in their lives, student not knowing what to do in their lives, or student just want to be done with school. Student that take a three year high school plan, know what to do after those three years are up. They are determine to finish high school so they can finally start learning something that they have wanted to do. In those three years student are willing to finish any assignments on time and will at least get As on their grades. They use their time wisely and always focus something to get it done. Once those are out of their way they are ready for the next step in their life. Most students take a four year high school because they want to take time of what they want to do in their lives. The reason is, is that students just do not know what they want to do. Students just do not know what interest them so they have a hard time of their whole life. Some students just know what they want to do, but do not want to take a three year high school because it can be to stressful for them. most student will finish high school and can continue to college wandering what to do. If a student ether take a three or a four year high school maybe just want to be done with school in general. those students may just think that college maybe just not worth the time, some just dont have the money to pursuing college. Those student may just know what to do and know that college is just not needed for that and is just a waste of time. They could have the resources already to pursuit the things that they want to do and so they are prepared for what is coming. To put it all together, make sure choose what is best for you wither it is a three year high school plan, or a four year high school plan. In those years student have got to prepare for them selves if they are taking a three year there is going to be a lot of work being done so they can graduate early. For the students who are taking a four years for high school got to use their time wisely and think about what they want to do during those years. I feel like what is the best option is a four years of high school because i dont want to do a lot of work in three years. so that is what i think about this prompt, four years of high school is good enough for me.",7,7,8,7,6,8,78,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

A grade B average is wrong and should be a C or close to an D as long as it passing. You should think about what you are doing to people that like sports. I like soccer and it would wrong if i didnt get to try out for that all because i dont have a B as a average.

You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you dont show to the World what you can affort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits. First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too. That you always work hard and know your position and show to everyone how you get there, because is not easy go to the top and keep the place, and most of the people give up, and not showing us their goals complete. Second, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault, ehat you did, you did thinking what its the best way for you, and dont take it like a loss, take it like you get more experience in life, and its not always happines have sadness too, but always you are getting more knowledge to know how to do that next time, and show to the world how you get there. Third, people always have challenging on their life that cause that people always want to know what are their limits, so they always push themselves to know what are their limits until they cant anymore. Then, they try to overpass their limits working harderst than anyone, sacrificing themselves, and living their pride to stay at the top or to go at the top. In my opinion, everyone have the right to improve their life that only they need its to be more confidence then its to do not to give up and push themselves in other words being perseverance to overpass their limits thinking always in big, and leave a legacy for the next generation.",7,6,7,6,6,6,440,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
641,819,526E417A97BD,"Many people tell me I have talent in soccer. For most of my years I trained to get better and better so I can become the best on my team. There were some faster players on my team and there still are. If you have ball control and skills you will be able to dribble past faster and stronger opponents. Also you will be able to hold the ball in your possession until someone opens up for a clear pass. Some skills I have are ball control, speed, agility, stamina, and dribbling. I developed ball control by practicing and watching professional soccer players play. My dad knows drills to gain ball control he taught me how to do them. Then I started doing those drills 3 times a week. I knew I was making progress because I was keeping more possession of the ball during my games and practice. I was able to keep possession of the ball until my teammates got open for a good position to receive the ball. Speed, agility, and stamina are some of the basic skills you need for this sport. For speed I did a lot of running, I would run at least 3 laps around the field for warm up with my brothers and dad. I also did many exercises for my leg muscles not too much weights because that would make my legs stiff. For agility I did some similar drills to the speed ones but faster movement and there are many different drills I also had to do with quicker pace. For stamina it was just a lot of running to get better at not getting tired too early and to be able to play for full 90 minutes of your game with enough energy. I enjoy doing drills for dribbling because its fun. My strongest skill in soccer is probably dribbling. I used to do a lot of drills for dribbling when I was new to the sport and I did more drills and got better and better each time. I would mostly play left mid because I was able to keep possession of the ball longer. Also when theres no one open to receive the ball or in a good position to receive the ball I would have to dribble through many players and I would go to the left corner so most of the defenders would come and try to get the ball leaving the striker open and making it easier for him to score and sometimes I dribble to the goal and try to score.

The first reason why I think wokring in groups is more beneficial is because more than on brain think better. More then one person can help on what they are working on. They can help each other on what they need help on. Four people in a group can get things down faster then only one person. People in groups have less to do then one person because in a group everyone does something and being by yourself mean you have to do everything on your own. You also get more tired if your wokring alone and in a group your talking to one other and discusing what you are going to do. Another reason why I think wokring in gourps is more beneficial is becuase you can learn something new from another person and if your working alone you only have what you know. In a group you come up with more ideas and support them if you think they are right or wrong.

I think police one is correct because not only the students sometimes need to call their parents to come to pick then up or pick up early or come bring their lunch, but also because is impossible to make everyone obey Policy number 2, even if is a school policy most people will ignore it, so I think Policy number 1 is harder to be ignored. And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch. I think sometimes phones are problem while using during class, but if is in lunch or free time I dont see much problem, because you are not being rude, or interrupting anyone. So I think that sometimes phones are useful at school. If we put policy number 2 at school it wouldnt make any bad things but students would still not following it, and lots of students would have their phone taken away or get in trouble because of their phones uses at school during lunch time or free time.

Some people say that the first impressons are almost impossible to change nevertheless, a person can easily change his/her first impressions because, human is a developed creature that can easily keep moving and change the first impressions with his/her ideas and experiences. It should not even be a doubt for the people who already faced this situation and has developed ideas. Some of the people says that the first impression is important. Yes, it is important. This is your first look to a person or another thing. It is easy to be impressed or shocked. But it is easy to go over it and change it. Almost everyone has their own ideas, not just the person who impresses. Another person can come with better ideas than that person. An average person is developing his/her ideas since kindergarten. Maybe by language, maybe science/math, maybe sports/arts. But almost everyone has their developed ideas. Even if they think that they dont have any ideas, they are using their familiys ideas. The persons family helps to create their mindset since they are born. A person is getting in this impression situation certain times in their life. Unfortunately there are some people who cant keep moving after the first impression. They keep their mind set impressed to that person for forever. But also there are some people that can easily get rid of that awful experience and can keep moving. Because they know that they can easily go over this situation and can change it.

Even though the first impressions are confusing and shocking, it is not a problem for people. Because they already experienced this situation. They already failed it or succeed it.

647,3720,2EEEE9C5E227,"Are first impressions impossible to be changed? It has been said that they are almost impossible to change. Most people tend to agree with this statement, but what if they are wrong? I personally disagree and believe that there are ways to make impressions change. Its all about giving the person the opportunity to show and see who they really are. First impressions are judgments we made before getting to know the individual. These impressions can be on favor or against the person being judge. Thinking on ways to make these impressions change, I have found some good ways and these can be; getting close to the person, asking to their close friends about them, asking teachers or other adults. All this based on my life term experiences. Getting close to the person meaning; talking to them personally, this could make a big change on the impression been transmitted the first time you saw the person. By talking to the person you will find so much things and probably things of your interest. When talking to a person you are making judgments in your head, but your mind always changes from what you thought this person was before. Asking to their close friends about them is a risky but also a good idea. Their friends know them better and can provide a good opinion on them. When asking their friends, you should make a comparation on all of their opinions, this would help to know this persons circle. Social circles are very important and most of the time define a persons being. Knowing this persons circle will change that first impression on their social side. Asking teachers or simply community adults will help a lot to change that first impression. Maturity level is something we always judge when comes to impressions. Teachers will tell you what is this person attitude at school. Community adults will tell you how does this person behaves on their everyday living. Whether you find it positive or negative, opinions definitely make the first impression change. People say that first impression only last a very short moment, therefore it cant be change because its just flash judgment on a person. On the other hand we have people like me that believe that as long as you have not contact with that persons circle, you are still in the first impression and it can be change. Getting to know an individual, Talking to their friends, and others adults opinions are all first impression changers. Overall first impressions are possible to be change and we need put these steps on play. If we would to follow these steps we would not be hating on each others and will live in a better world.",9,9,9,9,7,9,621,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

650,1210,3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldnt add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying. First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little. If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students. Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. thats why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day. Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havnt studied so I had to study, I wouldnt have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class. Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades.

652,1144,C3429FEF8AEE,"I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes. One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my countrys weather not to cold weather. Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days. However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break, a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

As long as the person doesnt give up and keep focus, then theres nothing to worry about. Staying on task isnt that hard, but if theres any distractions you must remove yourself from that situation and get back on track. Like imagine if a student was in class having trouble focusing because the students around them were distracting or noisy. Then they may ask the teacher that they prefer working in the hall because the noise in the class is to distracting to them.

654,3893,C652190DB53F,"Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy , they might dont like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However working alone is much better. Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person wont be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once youre relax no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind. During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is check with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spend time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time theyre asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work. Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, Im shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I cant do my work relax, I cant either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and wont agree, and there Im, needing to do everything again, in most of the times I dont even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesnt work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work. Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and full of everything. Working alone in a peaceful place, just you and your thoughts, to think about everything, every point, to analyze all things, relax and calm, whitout being shy or stressed. It is the benefts that everyone needs to have. ",8,7,6,7,7,7,2686,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

If students get involve in many of them, then they will not have time to do any of their work from school. Not doing work from school will affect their grades , and they also wont be able to participate anymore, for having bad grades. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the student, should talk to the school and ask if it is posible for their kid to not participate in all of them because of the time, and other responsabilities they have. First of all students should talk to their parents before taking any desicion, them both need to consider that if the student gets involved in many activities, then they will not have time to do any work from school. If the students spend too much time on the activities, then he/she would not have time for them other responsabilities. The school should make an runion for parents, so they can agree on the terms that the school want. Activities at school should not be controling, or making the students join so many activities. If the student does not do the school work, then they will have bad grades, that will affect them by not being able to participate anymore in any of the school actiities. Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students. Schools are responsable for any activite that it is happening in school, they should contact parents, and also have a reunion, so they would get the parents opinions. Parents as being the ones giving permission to the students, should considered any type of activitie that the student wants to get involved in. Participating in school it is good for students, but not when they do extraactivities. Some of the activities should be reunating with the students after school, and help them with any questio they have, or repasing anything that they didnt understand in the class. I think Schools should not control students involvents. Parents should be the ones desiding, and analizing before allowing their kids join any type of activitie in school. Students should not be able to participate in too many activities that would effect their grades. parents and school should agree on the desicions of wha is going to be better for the students.

656,3187,168958FC7315,I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because. Most parents only get off work at 4:00 and they need to be home before their kids. Also if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. First parents need to be home before their kids because. If they leave work early to get home they will get paid less. If they get paid less they will not be able to pay for their kids college. Or out of school activities like horseback riding and soccer. Or even paying for a nanny or a babysitter to watch their kid so they can get paid more. Second if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. If people learn more and get smarter they will have a higher a chance in getting in to a good college. If they get in to a good college they will have a higher chance in getting a good job. If they get a good job they will get good money to help their families out someday. In the conclusion thats why I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day.

657,3246,6AB2B78CE0AF,"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on peoples lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news. Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents dont get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because its on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesnt loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you dont know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language. Some people lives in another country or states and its hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You cant write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they cant meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at. Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks its fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology. Most people like that technology is growing because its better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABCs and 123s. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better. Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . Theres many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of peoples live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also its a good way to communicate with other people faster. ",6,7,8,8,7,7,1386,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Eating more fresh fruits and water can help students focus and not fall asleep in class. Eating junk food could make you tired and you wont have theenergy to do anything. Its better to take away the opition of getting junk food that the cafeteria puts out for students. Students wont be so tempted to eat it, and could chose a better and healthier choice. Most students want to stay in shape, so they try to eat healthier. adding more healthier choices in th school caferteria meun could help them stay in shape. most students dont workout so they depend on the food they eat. Some students tend to buy food and then throw it out becuase of how the food is made. The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out. I think having fruits smoothies, organic bake goods, and a salad bar could be very good for every school to have because the school could make a lot of money selling this at school and its healthy for students to eat and enjoy. most students wont have to get uber eats to get food that they like if the school sold smoothies or bake goods.

659,2036,BD0CEEC9B429,"People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters for many reasons, there are some emotions following our own decisions whether is right or not, people shouldnt always follow their heart and do something it could cost your life in the future. Another suggestion is asking for help to those who knows how to guide and gives ideas to people following their own decisions . Having some different types of ideas from different people or culture it can help us to work and do better in life because lifes important matters. It can help our sociatity do better for our new childrens and the anyone whos around in our environment. First of all, some particular people sometimes shouldnt always follow their heart or emotions whether is right or wrong we can always seek for help and do what we like to do in our daily life. For example, the other day I made the worst decision because I didnt have the courage to share my thoughts with anyone in my family or friend about quitting my job or not. I felt like if I suggested to ask someone to help me clear my mind I was going to do better now. Next, later on I saw my manager and told me they had a better job position for me with better health insurance plan. In this case I feel that seeking for guidance is not always a bad idea, is the opposite we can help each other. I made a bad decision for not comunicating with others about my problem whether to stay or leave, what i did it was left the job. Secondly, in many cases we think we know a lot, but in reallity is that other people can help us to do and give new ideas in our life. Than, If I want to change something in my life I have to love myself more and have the courage to comunicate with others and let them know what I am thinking and expect a better results. On the other hand, making your own decision can also help you to be succesful about life and not depend on others. For example, someone whos expert, can let me know and give me some advices about a proyect because they alredy know it or went through and have lots of experiences in that area. I always believe imformation is important if we working as a team is the best for the human we get to know each other time and values. Although, everything works best when we seek for a true guidance. To conclude, in many cases people are really succesful because they met or know someone from different culture and shares different types of ideas. In this world we live in many times this is the best way to work with as a team by seeking help from experience people and open up our brain more to understand the problem and to move on forward in our life. If woman and man work together lifes gets easier because we all putting our effords so that we can have a better tomorrow for our lifes and childrens.

If I ever get the opportunity to visit any place on Earth I would I would decently choose Europe. I would love to experience their culture and try new things while there. I would also go sight seeing and exploring every second I could. The first thing I would do in Europe is try out European food. I would go to a small town or city and ask the locals where their favorite place to eat is and what it is that they like to order there. After eating I would go around the town I was in and talk to the locals about what its like to live in a place like Europe. Another thing I would like to do while there is try out their fashion. I would go to different designers and ask them about the difference in the fashion from Europe to the one in the United States is. Lastly, since it is a special trip I would treat myself to a shopping spree. The most important thing I would be doing while there, is going sight seeing to famous places. Firstly, I would go visit the notorious Mona Lisa I have been dying to see in real life. Secondly, I would go on a walk to visit the Eiffel Tower. While there I will take cute pictures to post on social media for memories. Lastly, I would visit a bunch of art museums and look at paintings sculptures for hours on end. In conclusion, If could visit any place in the world I would visit Europe. Everything about this place is astonishing and I would one day like to enjoy that myself. Coming from a small city named Covington, it would be a huge change in scenery for me. I would love to experience their culture and try new things there while visiting.

Although some students who have difficulty with specific subject homework would be great. There will be teacher and students around. Maybe its their same teacher who teaches the same class it will be great for students. Teachers will know the weakness of student of what they need help more with during class.

Some homework club cost money which might be hard to pay for some families. If my school would have homework club it should be free.

I think people should ask for an advice to more than one person, because maybe the first person that they ask for an advice were wrong. For example, when I need an advice I always ask my parents first. I always ask both of them, but sometimes they always have different opinions, parents always have the right advice for you, but the problem is the sometimes they both give you a different advice. Sometimes they told you an advice that you might not like, or the one that you werent not looking for, and thats when I ask other people about advice like my teachers, friends, brothers, cousins, principals. just to hear what you wanted to hear or the right decision. Without a doubt, I would ask more than one person for and advice, to hear about others people situations. clearly, I would ask multiple people an advice because you never know whos wrong or whos right, but atleast people give you different opinios, so theyre giving you ideas about what you cant or can do.

For example there are students that are waiting to know forsure on what they want to do in life and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do so they can be successful in life.

669,1250,F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesnt mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up its what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like. For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesnt mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer cant do and that it trying to learn new things. We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing cant stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we dont want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesnt want it, doesnt keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter. We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we havent master it. That is the big challenge that we havent try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we havent control our emotion and that is the challenge that we havent master it. For that we have issues that we arent able to figure it out because its hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesnt understand why they react like that.

I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier. Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily. By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that theyre had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they dont like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy. Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food. In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better.

671,2729,F83702EEB830,"I agree with it because everyone has to do something productive in school and playing a sport is good for our health, yearbook writing is good for our spelling, and serving in a student council makes you be more confident and talk more with other people. Playing a sport is the best way to make our bodies stronger and healthy, it also helps us mentally when you are going through times going outside and playing helps you a lot. Playing a sport in school helps you have more energy and be ready to learn it likes opens your mind. Soccer for example is helps your body be stronger, Volleyball helps your hands be more stronger, Basketball helps you jump higher, and Football helps you run faster. Writing or coloring the yearbook is a great idea too, because you are writing something that everyone is going to see so i know you gonna write neat and correctly. Coloring is good for our brains too it helps us be calm and out of stress. Spelling is one of the most important things and writing helps it improved it, coloring is something that not everyone knows how to do it, but by practicing we are gonna learn. Serving in a student council helps you a lot because you learn something very important and thats learning how to communicate with other people and be nice. Sometimes its hard to communicate or talk to other people but we have to do it because sometimes the people needs someone to talk to and someone to be there for them. Helping to helping is a best thing you can do maybe you are not getting something from it but at least your being a helper. In conclusion I think that everyone has to do something is school it doesnt matter what but we have to.

674,1635,1FB89CF59E5B,"Influence can be divided in words, actions, and motivation. Words can give a individual influence. Actions can give a example of what to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it. Motivation has a impact in peoples life that can demonstrate influence to others. Some people say that giving a example is the only way to demonstrate influence. By analyzing each paragraph the reader will have a summery about how a example is not the only way to influence people. Word can give a excellent influence. Many people tend to hear what other influences say. For example a YouTuber called Alpha M teaches young men, or older men to be more succefull. If Alpha M does not have his charismatic character to talk, then many of his public would not listen to what he says. Words can dictate influence if the person knows what is he or she saying. Not only words is a key, but is a fundamental key. Action is a important key to demonstrate influence in peoples life. Actions tell in a non verbal way how to do certain things in life. For example, Messi, a really famous soccer player, has played soccer since he was 9 years old. His talent has influence many people to be better in sports, and to be better in life. If Leonel Messi did not had the talent to play soccer, then his influence would be less or non. Actions can tell what to do, when to do it, and/or, how to do it. By analyzing actions the reader can tell that actions is a important key, but motivation can give influence to. Motivation can do many things for influence. It demonstrates character, responsibility, and success and thats what people most want to follow, more in this days. Generic_Name, a police officer, has demonstrated a lot of responsibility in many times. He has been rewarded many times because of his excellent work, and his motivation. His motivation has influenced many people to obey the laws, and to be better in society. If Generic_Names motivation was not good, then many people would not obey the laws. Motivation can make millions of people to be influenced by one person. Motivation is a key, but some people say something else. Some people say that giving a example to society is the only way to influence people. Words, actions, and motivation can give a person influence to follow them or motivate them to do something. By giving a example the person is only influencing people in one way. In particular, a teacher from Generic_school tells students to not use their cellphones during class period, even though he gives the example of not using his cellphone, many students still use their device. If the teacher had giving the students the words, actions, and motivation, then the students would be influenced by the teachers order. Giving a example is part of influencing others. After reading each paragraph, the reader can have a conclusion that a example is not the only way to influence others in society. A individuals influence can be based by words . What to do, when to do it, and/or how to do it can give example of actions, which gives influence. A individuals motivation can demonstrate influence to others and have a impact in peoples life. Some people say that to demonstrate influence, the only thing to do is by giving a example. Words, actions, and motivation are three key factors that can give a person many influence around the world. Not only giving a example, but having this three qualities is important to have influence.

675,1807,35C5C7E2BB5E,"Working with a group or working alone which one is more beneficial? Well to me working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons. First off you can get help from other members of your group, you dont have to do everything alone you can give each person one thing to do, and you can learn more about the topic. Now that you know my reasons of why i think being in a group is much better and more beneficial then working alone let me go more in depth about it. Working in a group is great because they can help you with the assignment. If you are struggling and one of your group members sees that you need help then they will help you. They will try and make you understand the problem so you know how to do it. They will give you different strategies and other ways to figure out the answer. For example my math teacher put me and one of my friend in a group for a assignment we were doing and i did not understand the concept. I asked my friend to help me and she sat down with me and showed me how to do it. She gave me multiple ways on how to do it and if it wasnt for her help i would still be lost and not know what to do. Another reason why working in a group is better then working alone is that each person in your group gets a specific thing to do. If each person gets a specific thing to do in the group then everything will go by much faster. You would not have to worry about doing everything by your self and putting that stress on your body you will have other members in your group that will do their part of the assignment. Last week in history class my teacher put me in a group with 3 other members. We all had a specific thing to do i had to find the citation for the information we got,Chloe found all the information on the topic, Marcus found pictures of the information, and Sean found videos to support the information that we had. We finished the project at then end of class and we also got a A as our grade. Finally you can learn more about the topic with your other group members. They could find information on your topic that you once did not know before. It can give each student new ideas and information to make the topic more clear for them and also find new discoveries. It will also help them for test and even a quiz because they just did group work and also answered questions and learned new things as well. This is my final reason on why working in a group is much better then working alone. You can learn more about the topic, you dont have to do all the work by your self, and also your other group members will be helping you if you do not understand the topic and need a little more help. These are my reasons of why i think this is much better then working alone all the time. Having a group will give you more advantages then just being by your self trying to do all the work. It is much more beneficial and i also gave valid reason of why i think being in a group is much better then working alone.

676,1016,75B44E3CE6DD,"A positive attitude is not the key to success in life instead a hard working attitude is the the real key to success in life. Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesnt mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life. You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesnt mean that you will have a car of the year, no its not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals. You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? thats is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldnt go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has. After years of studying a career that you didnt like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them. In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore. Your positive attitude will not take you anywhere. ",8,8,7,7,7,7,1531,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
677,3436,9EAB766AF4BE,Students and teachers have important roles in their life. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job. Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade. Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time. At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.,7,6,6,6,7,7,2117,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
678,1760,F72EA674A872,"For a student like me, working in a group is alot better than working by my by self. Here is some reasons why working in a group is better than working alone. Number one we finish the assignement alot faster. Number two everyone is working on something different. Number three everyone is helping each other if we struggling on something. There is the bad part about working in a group is that there is alot of distration, there is also different ideas that everyone wants to put in the assignment. Now lets look at the good part on woekinmg on the assignment alone. number one there is no distractions getting in between you working. Number two there is only your idea on how you want it to look like. Number three you can ask the teacher on how sheor he wants the assignment to be done, so that means that the assignment is going to be correctly done. The bad part on working alone is that there is going to take more time on the assignment to be done. the other part is that is that you have to do all the wrok by your self and have to rely on your self. Other words if you pick to work in a group or by your self, are going to be struugling kinda the same thing like how mush work you have to finish, the different ideas on how you wnat it to be looking linke or how you want it to be done. Ones again for a student like me i rather work in a group than by myself because knowing my self i wont finish my work or the assingment. In a group i can have one part on the assignment that i have to finish. You can say i am picking on working in a group to do less work, and you are right because its going to be done instead of not doing the whole assignment. so for my coclusion i would want to work in a group instead of working alone because ""team work makes the deam work.""",7,6,6,7,7,7,3691,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
679,2617,B4B2CB4AA07F,"The School Board plans to add one and a half hours to school each day. Is that a good or bad idea? I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them. I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships dont fade. Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well. Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they cant just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have tests and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day. As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long. We have family and friends that we want to spend time with and that wont be able to happen if they change it because,"" they think we need longer days."" Yes we need our education and we will get it, but for now we only live once so need to make it count and focus on the present.",8,8,7,8,8,7,2432,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

The firs reason is not all student have the internet in the houses some students dont have the internet because their parents dont have too much money to but one or maybe because they dont have the tecnology. One friend told me that their parents think that the tecnology is bad for him because it is distraction and he needs to focus on his future. and if he dosent take that class online he will fall that class. every parents think different. Another reason because not all student are not responsibles. some student came to school but they dont do anything but it the teacher letf them that they need to do this, they do it, because they feel pressure and they know that the fall the class but is their class is online they will no care about the class, And they dont will take care about the class. The conclusion is tha bad idea take classes online because the internet is one of the things that they need it, anbd not all the students have it, they need to have their responsability the class and not to all the student care for their classes, and the last thing is because not al the students like to have classes online because they know that they cant consentrate in their house bacause all the noise around.

The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends. All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else cant. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer. Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it. Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they dont need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project. People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasnt fun for no student. Thats why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students. While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends.

684,3462,C8F035B467A7,"This generation is influenced by technology and they are used to it. They would be more comfortable with it as they are used to it . Its beneficial for students to do distant learning more than to go to school and do it. Distant learning is already being used through online and video conferencing, This days colleges and universities allows students to choose online courses of their own choices . Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home. Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school. They wouldnt have to do any of this, and have enough sleep to have a fresh mind to work with.

685,2743,62243789233B,"In todays society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self. Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so. Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks dont turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve. Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve. A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",6,7,8,7,8,8,1280,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Problem you have a chance to fix it before anything get even worse. I disagree with Duke Ellington because sometimes you cant always. Fix your problems, you might not be able to resolve the problem you have and. If you try to do your best with the problem and it doent work out you are going to make the problem even worse than it was before. Theres a problem with your sink and you dont know how to fix. It so what do you do you call a plumer to fix your sink pipes the plumer goes away to do another job and .Your sink starts to spit out water again you try to fix it because you where watching the plumer. Do it the first you try to fix it and the water leak gets worse and starts to flood your house so now you. Have to call the plumer again and pay again also you could havea called him before it started leaking again he could have walked you threw it. Some kids have pets and when those pets pass away and there. Parents try to replace the pet with another pet it will be hard for the kid he might not eat,sleep or even talk for along time. when my dog lucky died it was hard for me and my brother we barly ate or talked my dad. Tried to get other dog be me and my brother both knew it wasnt going to be the same. When your in school and you a kid sad and you ask him ""whats worng."" And he doent say anything back and you start talking about coming over after school because.

688,929,AA1ED5376761,"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isnt obtained by many but it certainly isnt hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money. Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually dont stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and dont get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, dont let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier. Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""Im not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he wouldve change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasnt smart enough for this job i wouldnt have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise. Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesnt give you eternal happiness a good attitude will. Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and thats attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.

Professional piano players gets most peoples attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960s for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano. A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use. There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock.

691,918,C70AEFA3CD16,"I am agree with the Emersons statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly. Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself. it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong. Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone. I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up.

This essay will have my opinion if we should implement this idea in my school or not. I will talk about some advantages and disadvantages about the implement of this idea to my school. I will suggest some action that a shool should take before the implementing of this idea of this idea. Imagine that you recieve a letter from your school saying that they are planning implement and idea which is to make students come to school four days instead of five adding two hours to the normal day of school. I disagree with this idea because it will affect my school which is a high school, instead of helping it. The first thing that will be affected will be the after school program and activities. If my school add two hours to our schedule each day will consist in ten hours, so students will be more tired and less student will be interest in involving in after school programs so the school might cancel them. I would said that it will affect a high school especially because there are a lot of juniors and siniors that work after school and it can cause to most of them to quit their jobs. Implementing this idea to our school have some advantages and disadvantages as well. One advantage of adding two hours to our schedule are that we will have more time to do our work in school because classes should be longer. Another advantage is that this idea help to conserve energy and resources of the school. A disadvantage is that after school programs might be closed because not so many people will be interested in that. The other disadvantage is that some students might have to change their jobs hour which is not easy and some of them would have to opt for quiting their jobs. Before adding this idea to my school or any school they should ake some actions before. First the school staff should make a meeting to discuss the idea. Then they should make another meeting but this time including the parents of the students. In which they explain to them in what the idea consist. Next they should send a letter home in which the idea is well explained but this time parents have to sign the letter and say wether they agree to the implement of the idea or desagree. Finally after doing all this now the school can decide wether the idea is being implemented or no. In conclusion I disagree with implementing this idea to my school because it will affect the school instead of helping it. I would say that this idea have a lot of desadvantages too. For example the school might cancel after school activities, some students might lose their jobs, and we will get home more tired. I think that the schedule thath my school have right now is just great because students play sports, participate in after school programs, and some others can work too. I think that my school should not implement this idea because we are fine with the schedule that we have and adding two hours will just affect us instead of being beneficial.

Usually, people dont try to do something new that they are already do. What is the best advise to get growing? Ralph Waldos statement is one, which motivates to others to explore new areas, and people will not grow, if they do always the same. To begin, in the society there are many jobs where is necessary to expand in new areas to get improvement like photographers that usually work shooting pictures, but they know how to shot a video also. Photographers can explore new areas like cinematography world or work as a journalist. They know that explore new areas is best way to grow as professional. In addition, people already know that leaving the comfort zone is another way to get a personal growing like student that travels to another country to continue his studies or like a doctor how explores new medicine branches to find a cure for illness. Both have the knowledge that exploring areas that they commonly are no related, will help them to grow. Exploring new areas led everyone to get a growing. To add, People will not be able to grow, if they dont change in order to grow. Persons that know how to do something very well, such as carpenter or construction, they decide to create their own businesses ,but they are scared to fail. They are afraid to do something new as manage a businesses even if they are mastered on it. Entrepreneurs should to undertake their companies, and they should to invest in new equipment try to grow. if they just keep doing the same without invest, they will not grow as company. In contrast, many people say if someone do always the same, they will be a professional in that area. like a professional sport player because they do always the same. However, even the professional sport player do something different every time, they have to improve their skill. If they just keep doing the same they cant play and be the best player either. This ideology is applied to many different areas where the subject want to be successful.

699,1973,17D51D57629D,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people agree with this statement. In my opinion, first impressions are always wrong, and they are possible to change. I have several reasons for my opinion. The first reason why I dissagree with this statement is because we can not judge on other people from the first sight. Meeting someone and talking to them dose not mean that you know them yet. Some people treat others with different way. For example, if you are close to me and we know each other for long time, I will treat you different than a person who I just met. The second reason why I dissagree with this statment is because we do not know what other people going through. If you met a person for the first time and this person was rude or aggressive, there should be a reason for this behaviour. Maybe the person had a bad day or perhaps he is going through rough situations. You should think about what you are going to do if you were in the same position. That is why I dissagree with the statement. In conclusion, Im against the statement that says the first impressions are almost impossible to change because we should know the person well before we think about any impression. In addition, everything could change and nothing stays the same.",7,7,6,7,6,7,326,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Some persons wants to finish carriers of schools, but they cant for this reasons. - They does not have much time to do it, because they have to work, pay bills and stuff like that. -Some students get out of the schools becauses they wants to help their family , and pass more time with them; take caring of they youngues bothers, sister, or work to get many into their house. Taking classes at home wil be the better options for the studens which ones wants to conitinue their carrier after high school, into the university,becasuse they can have a time to work, and to pay they carrier , and to get done what they wnats to be and their future ... Some carriers are really expensives, and a parents cant pay for it. Well the students can work and get many. And the same time with this programs they can still continue with they classes . Also begin home taking a classes, should be a better more consentration and relaxing eating an apple, least worrys and getting ready for a better future.

He is always happy and smiling he shows wisdom and makes other around him happy. My other person the shares wisdom and experience is my grandma. She has share a lot of her experience of cooking I learn something new from her cooking ability she is a bit old but it doest stop her she has a lot of energy to make food for her family I learn from by seeing her cook an egg or make chicken I see her, and learn from her experience. When we go to the beach my grandma always takes food so she wakes up early and starts cooking. From the experience from my grandma I learn how to use spices and cuts of meats in a dish, Also learn the amount of vegetables or spices that some dishes have my grandma been cooking for almost all her life she knows what taste good and what taste bad. She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates. I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

Im agree with churchill because the statement is important role not always your won when the people has a goals , each time when we try something new, we will able to success the first time but the problens is to how your work for you not failure on your life. when you start everything is enthusiasm only you know how work going for the future you cant not failure. Second ereason, the british prime ministern say that because maybe he do something and he try to do with different ways. The British look at for you wan to have something good or other thing is when you start but the first thing is when you failure because not always your won on your goals but if you want to mejories your own life, you need to focus on goals and them you will have your success on life.

703,2296,5384378F1AC2,"The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I dont have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got Fs for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process. Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the strangers voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential. In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.",8,8,8,8,8,7,1093,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
704,1878,1F7FD80F4396,"I totally agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson , being yourself around people of these days is complicated in the way that anything you do or you say is going to be judge by everyone , you will be the critique of your classmates,friends,family. Is basically most of the youth community feeling the pressure of being accepted by the society and they forget to be them and they start becoming someone else, just because the other person might have a lot of friends or they want to have the same popularity as them. 70 percent of the youth community either have depression or they get bully in high school. For the people who sees these type of actions and dont say anything because they are unprotected and are scared to be bully, first know that you can get help and you can be that person giving the courage to the other person feeling same as you. There are multiple reasons why you should want to be yourself and not just a copy. First put in your mind that you are unique , by the time you grow up the reality will come to show you that you dont need to impress anyone but yourself and all your actions is for you, your mistakes will affect you the most .When you are copying someone you should analyze what you win from it and is it really worth it ?.Now , ask yourself if the friends you have are really your friends,just because they walk with you and they talk to you doesnt mean they are your friends , and worse if they tell you to change who you really are. A real friend is that person that would love you and care about your own good, a friend is the one that appreciates you will all your defects. Someone changing you is someone you surely dont want in you life. Believe it or not is better to be alone than with bad friends,inclusive your own family can talk bad about you ,they might critique everything you dress,eat,but that isnt reason to change yourself and be what they are expecting you to be. When you are going to be a grown up, how can you tell someone to be always themselves when you dont even got to known the value of it. Being yourself is worth it, is loving who you are you wont be able to love someone else if you dont love yourself before. Having your own thoughts and always giving your honest opinions are good than just agree with something that you dont , being real is being you. Be real with your friends and if they dont like your opinions or they would make fun of you then feel happier that they finally showed their truth colors. If you cousins or any member of your family make fun of you because you unknown any argument they are talking about or they make fun of they way you dress then they arent family. Popularity is nothing compared to be yourself, somehow in any time you will feel so stressed ,sad ,and down and thatll be because you cant fake no more. Get you own experience, have your own goals in life, create your future. Instead of worrying about being accepted just worry about what you are planing for the future. Be a right person at least, dont copy someone ignorant , be a good well , always appreciate the appraisal of what you parents thought you and dont you ever feel shameless for it. In the future the success will be good recompense . Lastly be grateful to be unique in the world,be one in a million , always try to improve yourself and instead of going down go up , and if you think that copying someone that you think is up is being a winner you are completely wrong cause you are being a loser, know that there is a lot of mean people that could be around you and you might even call them friends when they arent .When people is jealousy behalf themselves they can do anything to ruin you when you think they are helping.

706,3416,6F30733E6B4B,"The first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree about that, cause me personal i dont have issues with no one around me. Maybe I can be a little annoying sometimes with my peers, but that doesnt mean that they dont like me. They hang around because they know how I am and what I do when they are around me. In the end of the day it doesnt bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me. This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. Its not based on my experienced, but one my best friends that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didnt like me that much so we didnt talk too much. He didnt even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didnt like me because I was dating someone he liked thats what happen. My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasnt I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked. I dont get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties. It was a good impression in the end we broke-up in a few days, but we still friends her mom still remembers me that good. sometime it is hard to make a good impression with people you know. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. My conclusion I disagree about that, cause me personal I dont have issues with no one around me. Its just that you need personality and charisma to make a good impression in my opinion. So go and look for that itss not difficult to have that.

707,2510,83C48C5697AE,"Living in a place with frequentely hihgest demand to provide my best, is one the must important achievement. I agree with Emerson statement because with the individuality we can reach all our goals. It is to important for me to recognize that i have to get my goals with effort. Because this help to provide, work hard, competition, and bocome the best .Individuality is a good factor to trust in my self to be the best because help us to look for option that help our lifes .Working by my self make me work hard. when a person work by his own company he try to do a great work fixing everything it is the such as work alone, if you work alone yo going to do a perfect job to impresione others labors .For example, when i work without partner, i try to do a great gob to be one on the best workers. When i do my own work i feel excite cause, i could receive an award for be a good producer. everybody want to be award for their job so everrybody wish a reward. But to be award we have to hsave capacity in the jobs Many person due the same thing like me cause doing my the own work provide a big result. So working by my self make an emotion to work hard and to increase the amoung. Consequently to do a individual work make a good results. Doing own projects workers show more production In the factory and result good Therefore this help to get alot resources by workers. Competiton is a ways to decrease the teamwork. individual competition is a big example of overcome. Examples could be when a person start to work in his job and start to recieve more money because the person is doing a great work ,this make that others poerson get mad so in the factory start the competition cause everyone want to recieve more money and they thick is unfair be reciving the same amoung of money so they start to argued why the manager give more money to the new guy but the thing is that he has a good specialization in the job. concecuently Many time the work competition provide a good production in the factory so, everyone want to get their goals like a good amount of products also,big accomplishment occur with the worker is trying to find a new way to get more product than other. For example, when a worker finished his assignment could receive free time,this make feel angry other workers so , they are going to try to look for others forms to produce more than the winner because, they want to receive the same reward for the production . To do a good competition the work have to be alone to and with big group people. competition is a good way for individuality work to provide a emotional affect. In many companies the owners look for a way that workers produces a lot and they offer money or free time to the person that make more products .as result, being in a factory with many labors working seperated make a big impact where everyone want to procud the most materials. Therefore,challenge could be a a good idea for separated jobs . Looking for an accomplishment to become the best. Every one in this life want to have something to be recognize in this world althogh,to be a succefull person we have to work hard. Not matters what tell about us such as critique,bullying ,etc. The only thing that is important for us who we are. So the best thing that could can happens in our life is be a place where frecuently we are demand to do different things. Although with many problem we have to be patience and support all bad things. Because,if we wish to be different than the rest of persons and realize our goals. thought must be working by our selves. Because sometimes nobody is with us to provide help. fighting by my self i could be a big man in the socierity. Currently in the world we have many competition one example can be soccer,almost the majority look in the tv .Soccer is a game where a team have 24 for player. They have to compite who is the leader in the team. So like in the real life the leader is the person that work hard,help the other players .Otherwise, could be a leader in a company, to be the leader of a company ,the leader had to compite with other person that wanted to become a big leader ..Therefore to be a person succesfull have to take individual decision . Being in a world where have to take decision and concern about goals is the best thing that we can have to show our capacity. Doing my own job make me put effort and dedication. Work in gruop is affect by bet. Being a different person than others. The person that different quality could be someone that can help. Because, this kind of person make the differences in the world trying to win in a place where the competition and the demand are in high level ,so they try to have imfluences in the in their jobs. The individuaity help alot in the world to be a succesful place. For example in the govermen there are many people with a big level to compite with other this, that means it i s has a great achievement in the government,so i agree with Emerson statement cause the competition provide good benifit for us and too the progress of the government,factory,countries,therefore being a part with competiton meke us to improve our best",6,6,6,5,4,5,1742,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

710,2830,B558AFC603D4,"There was a girl named Generic_Name, and she wanted to play violin like she used to. Generic_Name was struggling. It was not easy on getting back to playing it. Generic_Name practiced everyday no matter what. Generic_Name made a lot of mistakes on the way, but successed at the end. When you accomplished something; you have failed before you could have successed. Failing can cause before you succeed because you try to get where you are, you make mistakes, and you can make the wrong choices. To begin, failing can lead to succes because it happen before you succeed. For an example, you tell yourself that you will get your work done for all of your classes. Then you end up not understanding the work, but tried and turned it in the work. It can also be doing all your chores before you could go out and be with your friends. For another example, you had a lot of chores to do. It was getting late and you have finished all of your chores. At the end you could not go out, but finshed with all of the chores. It can also deal with reading a book. For an example, you want to read a hard book and finsh it, but you end up reading a different level and finshed the book. These examples show that you fail before you can succeed. Secondly, failure happens before you can accomplish anything because everyone makes mistakes. It can be when someone is trying to make a cake. For an example, you try to combine the inderigdeints, but they were not the right indergridents, Then next time, they put in the right inderigents. It can also be about when someone is trying to practice on their drving skills. For an example, The driver prcatices everyday, but makes many mistakes. Later on, gets better at it. People can aslo make mistkes by giving poeple directions on where to go. For an example, a lady needed help to get the location at the supermarket. The lady asked an old man where it was. The old man gave the direction, but made a mistake where the superamlrket was at. Then the old man told the lady that it was the other way. All of these examples show that mistakes can happen before you can success. Lastly, failing can cause by just making the wrong choice. Such as a girl wanted to tryout for outdoor track, but she loved playing softball. The girl tried out for track and made the team. There was a problem, she couldn[t be on the softball team because it was too late. The softball teamwas full. At the end, the girl should of made a better choice. It can also be about how you want to turn out your day. For an example, the boy wanted his day to be fun, but the boy was paying attention in his classes so he was sent to the offfice. This turned out to a bad day. Then he apologized and made his day better. This all shows that making the wrong choices can lead to failing on what you decide. This all sums up, that failure can cause before you succeed. Others say that failure does not happen when you succeed, however, I say that it does play out before you can success. Failing will always occur when you succeed. You push yourself where you want to be, you make errors, and doing the wrong decision are all reasons why failure can happen before you can success. Do you think there is failure even when you succeed. ",8,8,6,7,7,6,2442,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
711,3562,E83BE2C46D0D,"In some schools they have a program that pairs older student with younger student. The older student are available to assist the younger student in order to succeed on their goal. ""Aww man, I **** hate this, I dont know how to make this spaghetti and meatball sandwich I had the wheat bread, the sauce, manssreala cheese, spaghetti and my meatballs what else in this world am I missing. Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. I learn my mistake because one of the older student name Generic_Name, help me with a problem involving math and science. Generic_Name love math and would love to help me, their were a lot of steps I need to do it was only five minutes when he was done, but it felt like an eternal. I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes. We both learn a lesson that nobody is perfect the first time. I love the quote that Leon Missie said at the convention. He said ""Nobody Is Perfect The First Time, and remember that everyone has a talent or skill."" That means everyone has made a mistake more than once and try to fix it."" I remember the time I did a terrible mistake, I was in a chemistry class In Generic_School I was doing in a experiment, I had to put on my safety first. I over did with the salt a little bit. In a dangerous chemical called La Muete, which means that it is poisonous, so the becker exploded in to a million pieces and all I saw was fire on my cloth and on the teacher desk .The teacher quickly got the fire extinguisher and put it on me first and then the fire form letting spread more and boy I got my **** kick by my mom and dad so hard that they made me pay for all the damage I created. So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I dont mess up again. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I wont do that chemical bond ever again."" Often successes can help both young and older student. Sometimes the older student can make a mistake too and teach the younger student. That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you dont know something dont leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist wont be there all ways. Life dosent work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I dont pass then I dont ever get my license even when I really old. So I study hard and where im I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I cant drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too. To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again?

712,3883,41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime. The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What Im trying to say is that i wouldnt have accomplish that if i wouldnt have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that dont do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better. Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it. Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent . Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that arent doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature. For knowing that they are doing thinks that are smart.",7,6,8,7,6,7,857,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
713,1701,7680EF5AD3CB,"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because its pointless, unfair, and not important. To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. Its also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. Its no where near educational related. It wouldnt be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class. The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless. In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. its not important for students to take any of those classes. Its not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs dont require for you to have any of those classes. ",7,7,6,8,8,7,1543,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

The second way is our character formed by influences beyond our control, by not being able to control it. The most reasonable character trait would be choosing our own character trails, because it makes the most sence out of all and most of the population can control on their emotions. There are different types of character traits, for example funny, exiciting, joyful, and many more. Our character traits are formed by our own influence and by our own actions. Thats what causes them to react from different types of emotions. For the most part, we are able to control our emotions, but sometimes we cannot control over them so they go out of control. Character traits can be used in many different ways. However, there are some character traits that we cant control, it would happened to us by itself because we sometimes dont have control on ourself. For example anger, sadness, and depression are the reasons why we lose control sometimes because we are unable to control over it. These emotions can be dangerous once you are out of control, you dont even know what you will be doing, it could be something really terrible. Thats the reason character traits can be good or bad sometimes. Some people support the fact to pick there character traits for themself, some think its not in our control and we are unable to control it. The people that said they decide to choose the character traits for themself, say when they do something they can feel the emotions in contol of them and do what best fits them. On the other hand, the people that think the charater traits is not in there control, say if they are working or doing anything the emotions of them just happens and they cant control it. In most of the cases it is caused by the bad emotions like being mad, or sad and more. There are many more reasons of people talking about character traits. Not all of them are good nor not all of them are bad. It mainly depends on the person who is controling it. For the people that are unable to do so can control over it by doing couple simple things and not letting there emotions take over them.

I think that getting guidance from experts could help make decisions better because most people look and ask for guidance on a lot of things most of them are on decisions to make whether its a good or bad decision to make. I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didnt want that to happen. I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasnt the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasnt good for her and if she keeps dating him the arguments could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. I told her that its going to be hard but its for the best. People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didnt like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance.

Failure make people to give up when they mess up something but they has to keep going and doing thing possitive. Now i going to writting some example and information about the enthusiams and failure. First, In this life if we not make a mistake (failure) we are not going to learn anything but we has to know if we fail we always has to try again and again no better what. We always need to thing possitive and has the enthusiams to do it again and get what ever we want in this life but always with the enthusiams because we need to has enthusiams to try again. Dont drop out your dreams if thing not going well. Second, we need the enthusiams in our lifes no better if we failure, the enthusimas is the impulse to keep going and get everything like finish high schools, past the test, has a good grade but first thing possite and be enthusiams in things you really want to be successful in the future. Third, the enthusiam is a great enjoyment, interest or approval . I think everyone has interest in something and we can make it, we can has everything but if propose in life. For me, my enthusiams is graduate from high school to make mother proud of me because thats why she came to United State to give me a better future and now she enthusiams to see her daugther graduate from high schools. Addition, ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" in this quote said failure to failure is an instance of something not functioning properly but is not mean to give up just doing again but never loss enthusiasm to thing you love or want in the future just keep going make yourself proud of you and but never lost the entusiasm you has for things you love just because people talk bad things or thing is not good well, life give lesson to see if we are strong. Enthusiasm is everything in life. conclusion, I will said that Minister Winston Churchill is rigth because how i said in the beginning of my first paragraphs enthusiams is everything in life, we need to has enthusiams in everything we do to make it better.

Life can be hard if people dont enjoys their jobs, causing them to have depression. That is why, students should select to visit and learn about the work that interests them because, it gives them more time to think, making plans for their future, and to gain experience through out the school years. Students should be planning for their future and to decide which class to take in order for them to learn about the work that interests them. Many students have successfully acquired the jobs they intended to work because of how much work they put into to plan and learning the stuff they need to know on how to run the job. Planning is really important for all of our lives. For example, the military uses a plan and tactics in order for them to calculate and for the plan to be successful. Because of that, planning has a big impact in our lives and helps us to decide on what jobs to do and to give us the time to think. This way we can understand the situation and whether or not if the people and their families to decide if its a good idea. Students can gain little experience by taking the class every each year, this way students can learn more about the Jobs they want to be in. For example, JROTC are similar to military but trained to be a marching men and to juggle with rifle (from what I know of). They exist because, it helps students to understand what its like for them to experience JROTC. I also think this is very important. Its like, warming up for a swimming contest but, how can you win if you dont know how to swim? Swimming class exist to help people to not drown. If you take swimming class every year, and gain a little bit of experience, you will be able to win the swimming contest. All this reason is to proof of why gaining experience is a good thing and help you understand the job you wanted to applied for. Giving students the time to think on what jobs their most interested on is also very important for this prompt. For example, students need time to think whether or not if its the right class for them. Every year in high school students are required to pick three choice to pick their class. It is called the Course Election, where students gets to pick three class that are interesting for them or forced to pick because it is a requirement. I really like this idea, it helps us understand what were interested on and what to learn. I think three years is enough for students to plan and to have a little experience for their future. In conclusion, student are more successful if they are to be picked for themselves instead of the school choosing for them, because the more they like the class and the job they are going for, the harder they will try to succeed.",7,8,8,8,6,7,1289,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

721,2059,FC9DA73D1EA0,"Even in classroom everything catch students attention! Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they dont focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face. To begin with, sometimes students dont learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer. In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do. For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind. To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home. At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away. In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass. Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily. Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.

However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic. In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said dont ask me, thats not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasnt nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, thats one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group. Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. Some people said that working in a group its more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination. In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work.

723,2799,D45494CE3D2E,"Human survival depends on technology, we can not live without it. Technology is used in our everyday lives, from the very moment we open our eyes to the end of the day when we go into our sleep. Technology has really advanced a whole lot in comparison from the first telephone made up, to todays modern devices. Technology may have a negative impact to it, since technology is everywhere it is almost impossible to keep out of reach. Young children start to us it to early in life, they get addicted and they cry if it is taken from them. Technology may have that negative affect but it has many positive affects that come from it as well. The beginning of technology all starts back when the first telephone was created by Alexander Graham Bell. The telephone he had created is much different from the ones you see today in everyday use by millions of people. His creation of the telephone was like a brick, very big and heavy. That device was more of a at home used only kind of device, not something you could easily just carry around with you. his invention probably was not the most popular right away since everyone was so use to living with out one it was not much of a necessity. As time progressed other inventors took Graham bells invention and invested further into it, adding and taking away things it had. For one the size and weight of it was changed by a lot through out time as well as the capability of what you could do on it. At first it was used only to transfer calls to communicate with somebody verbally without having to be face to face or even at close distance with them. Many individuals wanted to be the inventor of a phone and there are more than one, therefore because of this there are different companies, not just one that produces electronic devices. Around the early 2000s Apple, which is one of the biggest electronic device companies had released the first Iphone. Everyone and everywhere all around the world people were purchasing Apples new product. Throughout the years Apple has made so many products for people to purchase from cell phones,earphone, tablets, computers, watches, portable chargers, to just about anything for people to buy that they may use in there everyday lives. Though all these advancements in technology may have caused some negative impacts in life such as that children from a young age get addicted from them it has also helped them. Parents have a big impacts in this whether they decide to hand their children a electronic or not, most parents that do let them opporate a device usually have limitations in what they can do or watch and for how long. Letting young children use this technology isnt all bad, there are television shows that help them learn their shapes, colors, objects, movements and simply learn how to communicate with others before entering school, nothing wrong with being a little ahead of others. ABC mouse is one of many great resources online that help children with their education and it is also done in a fun way for them to learn and enjoy their studying. Technology is used by everyone all around the world and even out in space! Everything around us is being technologically used by us, inside of our own homes and outside. Security cameras, the thermostat that keeps us warm in the comfort of our homes and AC that helps us cool down on hot sunny days, the foods and drinks we store away in our fridges and freezers, WiFi box, T.V(s), door bells, all of that technology and thats just in our homes. Outside everyday technology would be like he vehicle we use to get to our jobs, the traffic signals, GPS to help guide use to get to our desired destination. You have a paper due or something you really need information on whether it is school related or not and the library is closed or you just can not get in reach of one you can simply do your research from any location you may be in with a click and swipe on a screen like your cell phone or computer. Machines are technology used like those in hospitals that are seriously used for human survival when someone is terribly injured or a new baby is born. Technology is still progressing and it will only become more advanced through out time, everyday inventors and scientist use it to make new ways to cure up diseases, find out where they come from and how they can be prevented. The creation of technology on our world has been very helpful to us all in every way possible, without it there are many possibilities of certain deaths and accidents that could have occurred if it did not exist. The amount of advancement that it had gotten to will only help it get greater so we can be prepared for future tragedies that we would not want this world to face. Technology has been an extremely positive thing that has happened in this world for millions possibly even billions of people who use it.

A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills. First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didnt really do my homework and I knew that I didnt make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didnt like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded. Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done. Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didnt know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didnt need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didnt know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way. I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher.

They do this to help out younger students that are just beginning school and are scared and dont know what to do in School or how to react because of their first time being in School. The older students assist out the younger ones on how to read, comprehend and to get the understanding of how books are read and what they could be used for in their future life, this is the reason older students are so helpful and useful. Another amazing this program is useful is because for those students that are home alone and have no older brothers or sisters, this program helps them get a understanding of how it feels having siblings at home. This program entertains and not only that but also influences younger students on how it feels having a sibling at home and the amazing time spend with each other as well. I think this is a wonderful and interesting idea because it interests kids and makes them want to return to School and love School if they are having second thoughts about School, for example if they do not like it and dont want to return, having a buddy might want to change their mind because they can only imagine the fun and exiting time they can have with their buddy! Teacherss, Principals and other members like the School bored did a smart plan of creating this fantastic program of older students assisting out the younger students and teaching them a thing or two about certain things. Younger students look up to the older students and the older students are known as role models because they are much more mature and that is why younger ones look up to them. The reason why this program is helpful for both younger and older students is because this program impacts both younger and older students, it impacts the younger ones because it teaches them how to read and write and it impacts the older students because they learn how to assist younger ones and how to communicate with them. This great program will help out students right now in class and also they will learn how to use these skills in a daily life and maybe on their everyday lifestyle and jobs. When a student or any person assist out another, at the end they will always feel proud about their selfs and they will want to keep on helping others in their daily life. That is why they might have this program so students can get the feeling of how it feels helping out someone and so the younger students can learn how to read and get the feeling of how it the sensation would feel if they had siblings at home. They might fight but at the end they will later then respect each other and they will learn how to communicate with each other. School is important because students learn from their mistakes and then next time the same problems happen to them they will learn from it and make it better then the first time. They learn and learn so when a student is a fully grown adult they know what is expected of them and how to assist others if needed also they will be more mature and will know how to act. if someone is out their struggling or having a difficulty time doing something, the adult that was ones a students and helped out younger students will automatically know what to do and how to help the ones that will need help. This is the reason this program is so helpful and I hope they keep having these things for students in the past and will continue to help them in the future.",6,6,8,8,7,7,2640,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
727,2813,6D06DAD5446C,"I agree that people should get the help, so they can make great decisions. Because the other person could probably be wrong with somethings. Also the other person doesnt have any saying in your life, if you dont want them to. And you are the only person who can change the outcome of your life. even so your the main person in your life, its okay to hear others out even though they are wrong sometimes or if they are sometimes right. The first reason is that its okay if you dont want the other persons help. But you should hear them out so you can get something out of thing. For example my friend Generic_Name, she love to write stories and love to sing, and dance, but she too embarrassed to do what she love. So one day I gave her some ideas, but she didnt want any, because she dont want to do them, but next day, she gave some of my ideas a try and she like it but still dont want to do it anymore. But long as she listened that good enough for me. The second reason is people dont have any saying in your life, yes its true, but theres people willing to help you through your life. But it only depend on you, if you want their help or not. For a example my sister Generic_Name doesnt want help from me nor our parents. But its okay, because she know that we want to help her, because we care about her,so we will not stop trying to help her. But there is times she let us help her out with her life, and thats good. Longs she lets us in her life, thats good enough for us. Last reason is you still are the main person in your life, so no matter what you do your life, just remember it your life is your alone, and you are the only one who can change the outcome of your future. even If you want the help of others or not. For example Im 18 years ago, and im still having problems in my life, but there are people that are willing to help me, but im scared at no matter what im still feeling down with stuff. But no matter what they are still willing to help me. And im happy, so yeah thats good for me. So basically, NO MATTER WHAT THERES ALWAYES WILL BE PEOPLE WHO WANTS TO HELP YOU. So its good to get some advice and wisdom from others. even though you dont want the help, its still good to get some advice from others.",8,8,7,6,6,7,1423,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

And the food there is amazing in France they also have a really good accent. But the main reason i want to go to France is because of the thing to see their stuff like the ifle tower. the other reason is to meet other people so in that case i would have to travel on a day theres going to be a lot of people. The reason I would go to France is to have the knowledge to be able to tell someone about how it changes you and how its like and different temperature like how the country is to going to change on bad temperature their might just a small amount of people outside. On a good day there is going to a people are walking around having fun. You also try to see if the people their nice or mean to other people. If I ever had a choice to go to France I would say yes and when I get the first thing i would try is there food.

729,2695,0F7DB6BD1AD5,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done. students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking. students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases. students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time. Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise. ,6,4,6,6,6,5,207,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

732,2270,FAAFFC983E47,"The majority of the students take about four years to graduate and go to the college, but also there are students who decide to finish the high school in tree years or as soon as possible. The question is, why are they trying to finish the high school earlier that the other ones?. A few people decide to finish the high school because they have other kind of goals to accomplish like travel or enlist to the Army etc. In some situations this people arent able to take electives courses like, Graphic Design, Culinary arts, Earth space, Mathematics, Health AP or Driving class. Whatever of this ones or others ones they cant enjoy them. In other situations this students take nigh school or summers school or both. In my personal opinion take nigh school is really tired because when you leave the school yo have about one hour to get ready and go to the other school to take your course. In other way, there are students who do not have support by their parents to finish the high school, and that is why they decide to finish early to have more time and find a job to support themselves. Even if they have a half time job, is not enough. Enlist to the Army is a good idea for some people especially for high school students, they have a conversation with their parents to have the aprovation to do three years in the high school and get a career into the Army. Some guys also want to finish early because they want to go to the college in other country or because they want to travel and have a extravagant life, this are the most common situations of why students decide to graduate during three years, but is better that dropped the school in the last year if they have the normal school ( four years). I think that this programs that the district offer is good for those who have the potential to do it and finish the high school as soon as possible, and they need to know the probability to do not have or be able to have elective courses or Generic_School. I know about some guy who decided to take this program offered by the schools districts. He told me that is hard because while he was in the school he also studied for the exams of nigh school and he had courses really bored and after that, he took summers school all of this on his freshman year, I think that the only need to be constant interest and keep a good grade to success. In my opinion take the traditional four year is better because you can enjoy of many things like the clubs in the school, community service or even participate in a sport team in the school like soccer, football, tennis or basketball. this things is what make a school awesome. in the traditional four year, you can pick electives courses that you really like it and do not make you bored. Also in the traditional four year you can talk to you consular to have Generic_School. But when you take the tree years you can not enjoy about you favorite things. Take the tree year since my point of view is bad but could be great for other ones who has different things to accomplish, I dont have rush to finish early, and that is why I think about the tree years and the traditional schedule for the four years.

733,1583,FF7698C3CC8B,"Imagination is a thing all of us have some persons have more imagination than others, but I think we all have it some where, like my mother say ""if you dont have imagination you would not be successful"". I agree with what the scientist Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more. To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it. Also you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw. Finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you I think Im an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when Im thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of thing and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it. In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you dont have imagination you wont see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.",7,5,7,6,6,7,3894,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
734,2149,603863409B06,"Most of students live with so much stress for study so hard and each time they depress more. They need to take a break sometimes. May breath fresh air and entertain themselves in something that can motivate to follow forward. I agree that students should be required to take one of these classes. Its very important to be creatives in some moment. Taking that type of classes make to students being relax forgetting for a moment the problems, helps to lose some fears, and above all they can benefit in their future. Arts in general can help to people who can need a break of all the problems they have everyday and thus not live with stress. I have a friend who live with so much stress for every thing he pass. He try to be the best in all of his classes, but that cause more stress on him. For that reasons, he decide to take one or two free hours everyday to relax himself. The best decision he take was to choose a music class. After he start to take the class, he told me: ""The guitar class is very amusing and interesting. It helps me to forget all the problems that cause me stress. It was the best decision I take."" Now I see how my friend is so happy and calm after he start his guitar class. He changed because he found something that he really likes to do and that helps to be relax. The performance class helps students to being more sociable with the others and lose one or more fears. Im a girl with a lot of fears, but my biggest fear is to talk with others. That fear start to appear with the passing of the years. I was not a timid girl when I was a kid, but little by little I think more in what the rest think about me. Thats why I decide to take a drama class. I need to confess that the first classes was very hard for me because I didnt speak with anyone, but with the passing of the days I start to speak with my companions. They were kind with me so that was more easy to me to have a conversation with someone. The art classes can be very important to some people because it helps to have a good future. I have a teacher who I always show her my drawings and sculptures because she is my favorite teacher. She is not a art teacher, but I know she appreciate me so much because every time we talk she told me: ""Your drawings are so beautiful, in the future you can be a teacher of art or sculpture. I know you are going to have a great future doing what you really likes."" I think a lot of what she told me and probably after I finish NOVA Im applying to some university about art, and maybe I can apply for a grant about art. In conclusion, its better if students take a music, a drama, or an art class so that can relax and have fun at the same time. Most of the people believe that type of classes should be electives because some students dont like to play a instrument, act, or even drawing. But I think that every student needs to take one of that classes to leave all the stress away. That type of classes are for students to turn on that creative part that they have inside and can have fun, not to being boring and stressing every time.

The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups. In my oppinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group dont participates in the work or they dont want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons. First reason , I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesnt know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work. Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distract you or other teammates of the group. Third, working alone can be more benefict than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work. I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you .

In my opinion, i think student should think about their career at a young age. First reason why they should think about their career is because they could know some step of how to get into their career. They woukd know some steps on what to study or in other words know what classes are the right one to take. An example is that when i was in high school i didnt know what to study for. my teachers couldnt find the right classes for me to take. Most student get into high school without knowing what they would want to study for. Another example was that when i got into high school they ask me for my career i told them what i wanted to be. Once i got into 10 grade i change my mind and decided to change my career. When i try to get into my step for my second career it was already too late to apply which made me now find my own way to get into the career i wanted to be in. Most student get into high school with out knowing what they want to study for. Another reason is that when they dont know what to study for as their career, They dont find a way after in how to get into collage. It is always a good first step as a high schoolar to know what they want to be. Last exapmple is that i didnt think about my career when i was in middle school and now in my high school year i didnt get into any of my career i wanted to study for. When you know what you want your career to be teachers help you get the right classes. Teachers also help you get into the collage you want to study for your career. Some people think knowing what they want to study for before going to high school is just a rush thing for them. People be saying its too early to know or think about your career. In my conclusion, Most student should know at their young age what they wanna be. My advice to all the young student making their way to high school they should start thinking what they want to be.

I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are. Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldnt get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude. Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didnt like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didnt want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didnt take what sh said seriouly and left.

And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you dont know them. First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are. Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change. Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think its a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change. In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",9,8,9,8,7,7,2678,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Imagine the enormous crowd enjoying your performance. One talent I have is using math everyday. Some people do not use math as much as I do. I use it when I go to the store,at school,and at home. Math is one of the things I use everyday. I use math when I am at the store because I have to calculate my money and how much I will be using. I develop this skill from school because I have use math is most my whole school career. Some individuals might think my talent is unusual,but I think that my talent is helpful in the real world. I would rather spend my life as a math expert than just staying at home and doing nothing. I want to succeed right now ,so I can become a well-educated and successful adult. In addition,another place I use math is at school. This is the place where I developed this skill. Teachers have an excellent job making me the person I am today. For instance, I am doing my project and need to get the dynamics right I use make to help me with the project. I would like to became a math teacher at my school. Math is all around us , but you just dont notice it. Moreover, the last place I use math in is at my house. I use it in dividing my chores with my siblings and I use in the kitchen when I am measuring ingredients. I also use it when I do my homework. It helps me when I am playing basketball because you need an arch to make the ball straight in. It helps when I am older because I would already know how do math and know how to use in the real world. In retrocept, there a variety of talents ,but my talent is using math everyday at home,at school,and at the store. I use math almost everyday of my life.

So I think we should do an assembly on how important it is to keep our planet and city clean and educated.

Some people ask one person for an advice. Other people talk to different people. Talking to one person can help, but asking more than one person can help you understand something better. If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice. I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better. Another good thing about asking for an advice is that if i go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when i go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff i did. If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When i am having trouble doing something or understanding something i should ask others a advice of whats a good way or doing it. I think that other people should really ask for a advice.

745,2511,FEE662801AF4,"I think that homework clubs are good in school because, the students can take there time and procces ,to get to undersatnd, there homework, students can finish early thier homework and dont have to do it later, teacher can help more and teach more if thats there passion; what they like to do; to teach and want students to get good grades in there class or any class. Some students might not understand the home work or just cant cach up. Students in homework club can cach up or even can be finish with the unit that they are working on. Some students can be cached up a lot and help the ones that are not or the ones that cant go. For the teachers. teachers that like showing kids more education, teachers that like helping students when there stuck in a problom, tachers that can stay after school that dont have nothing to do or dose not have children. Those type on teachers can actualy enjoy after school homework clubs. teachers that actualy like there work can go because some teachers is just there to teach, leave, and get there money but some, actualy do like it they like helping when there wrong giving them corrections. Students can finish there home work early. children sometimes cant do home work at home because they might be to busy or has a lot of activitys go after school like soccer, basball, basketball, ect. Some children might be able to go to after school home work clubs if there are after school buses but cant if there wernt home work clubs they would not be able to do there homework because, when they get home they have to take care of there brothers and sisters because mom works all day or sometimes parents might get sick and need them to take care or them.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we dont try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to dont have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesnt give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not. An example of failure can be, ; like when someone went to ask for a job but, he doesnt had the job because he didnt finish the high school that is failure in his life, but he decide to retake the high school in his free time, and he graduate from it, he can back for ask in the same job, he is contracting at this time it was because he has a great enthusiasms in his life, he never stop because he didnt had the job at his first try he continue and he did it. I know not everything is rose color but sometimes you need a little bit of failure in your life, to see how brave you are and how strong are you for the life situations, failure its not mean that you are a loser, not its mean that you are training for the difficult situations in the life but with just a good enthusiasm you can do it again and again has many times you want to do that is my conclusion about how failure can affect your life.",7,5,6,6,5,5,1516,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
747,3899,3D72844EC5B0,"Well, Im desagree with this statement, because no always your first impressions of something its impossible to change. Sometimes you will have a lot of impressions of people,things,or animals..However some percent of humans can not change their first impressions ,because they think that ,they are sure about their impressions , and there is when your mind has to change,so you can check first to make sure that yours impressions are rights,and I will support my response putting myself like a example; One day , I was at my house doing some work out ,and then I started to having some strainghts impressions, That I had the impressions that my girlfriend was cheating ,with my best friend, so I get mad ,because that impression was to difficult to believe, also you have to be carefully, when you have a bad impressions of someone, you have to know how reaction will be. Also you have to make sure that yours impressions is right, so I called my girlfriend and we had a long conversation , but the thing is that I did not know , how tell or ask her my impression that I had with her and my best friend, however I was trying to change my impression, but my mind and my brain was confucing, because that impression can put me in problems with my girlfriend or somebody else, so the thing is that I did change my impression ,knowing that not all your impressions thyat you think are rights, some impressions that you get sometimes, its because you are not sure about something, or you no truths in that person who make you have a bad impression. My point of this statement is that the first impression its possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressionas or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not. Now, when I have impressions I keep for myself, that is one of the ways to change your first impressions, because that help me on my first impressions.",4,5,6,4,4,5,790,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
748,880,BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldnt want to graduate a year early right? but in the end its not even worth it. I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesnt make you more than them, it doesnt make any student seem smart, its just them taking the short cut to end school. I believe it isnt a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resumes, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished. Another reason why I dont think its a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students whod want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, dont do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isnt a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesnt make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isnt the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that dont even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job thatll pay you well and something that you know youll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months. For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who dont plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just dont take the school serious but only if they knew that, thats the key for them to open to get to their future. If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, Id think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that theyd want to get a head start with their career. Thats good Im not saying its bad, its just something I wouldnt do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity. In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life. School may not be the best but it can sure give you the best career life.",8,8,7,8,10,8,2508,"conventions 8, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
749,1024,4C3AFB55C4F7,"Imagine someone that you know, that is trying to show you what maturity looks like. And she set a example for you to see, by how she talk and how she treats her friends and family. You watch how the person act and talk. Later, you start to follow what that person does. This influenced you to also be respectful to the people around you. Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others because people follow what you do,know right from wrong, they are going to influence more other people. First reason, setting a good example to influence others is the best thing because people follow what you do. They look up to you as a role model for them. Whoever you hang around with, that is whoever going to influence you. For example, if someone is doing a act of kindness, then you are going to do the exact same thing, because it influenced you. Philosopher Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Overall, if one person set a good example in life, it influence the others also. Second reason, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because you know right from wrong. If no one set examples for others to see, then they would not know what to do when difficult situation arrives. Examples guide you to do what you know is right. People would not know how to act if theres no examples to be set. In summary, examples setting by other people help you make good decisions in life. Third reason, some people may believe that setting examples by someones behavior is not the best way to influence others. However, I believe that setting examples is the best way to influence others because its not just one person that they are influencing, but many more people. For example, if a girl help a elder lady that needed help with carrying groceries inside the house, then others will see that and learn to help people that are in need also. Because of that one influence, others will care for people that need help. If one person set a good example, then others will also set a good example for many more people. In conclusion, many people will be influenced because of that one example that people set. The best way to influence someone is through examples that are set by others, and how their behavior and attitudes are towards people. Setting examples is a good way to show people what you are trying to teach them and it gives them a idea of whats happening. Through all of these examples that people had set for you, they will influence you. When you do the example, because it influenced you, others will also catch that influence from you. So yes, setting examples is the only thing that will influence people and make a big impact in peoples lives.

750,3211,296B1DD1E251,"Do yo have a good impression? I am agree, the first impressions are almost impossible to change, because I feel that the first impression is important for everyone. There are many people that do not show how really are, and try that everyone love them, but at the end they show how really are and everybody move away. The first impression said everything about us. I believe that, If you show them everything about you, the people will love you how you are and they will trust on you. Always we need to be honest with you and with the people. My ideology is be honest with yourself and do not show something that you do not are, If you want that everyone show you how really are. I always show how I am friendly, lovely, funny, charismatic with everyone, and also try to help when someone need me with my knowledge and capacity. One of my experience is in my work, every single day new employees go to work in the store and I always help them to know how the store need to look like, and also with the customers I always smile, because I show my first impression with them, and I feel great when the customers saw me with a smile and they said: Hi, how are you today, it is good to see you and have a good one. I have few months working in the store, and I feel comfortable with everyone, because the customers do not know you enough, but they trust on you and they tell you something about his life, and with the rest of the employees we pass fun, We are like a family and we help us ourselves. In the school is a little bit the different, because in the school I am shy, I do not talk with anyone just with my best friends, but I always show my emotions, enclose with the new people in the school, but sometimes they pretend be good at the first time, but with the pass of the time they have different attitude. That happen to me around 2 years ago with different person, the first person I knew her in 9 grade, when the both was new in the school, We became friends and everything we did together, but She change with the pass of the years, in summer another friend and his sister told us what she talk about me and my sister, but I always be honest with her and friendly and she showed me something different than the first time. Then, with another girl was a little bit the same, because she had jealous for my sister and I to had good grades and be active in the school the last year, but she always had bad grades, and We tried to help her but she never wanted, then with my sister and I move away from her because she was friendly with us but she was a bad friend with us. I feel that we need to show always how We are not matter what everyone thing about us. Sometimes is good a new change in our lives, but never changing you essence. Something that I always do is think about my weakness and how can change it to a positive way Finally, I think that We can be success in the life, the first impression will open many opportunities in the world, I know that the good person are these that show a good attitude when you know it the first time, and something in your heart told you that you knew a good person. Everyone will have present that they can trust in you and they will feel great to know a person like you. The first impression is always a good one. Many people do not know me and they think that I am conceited just how I look like and they do no take the time to talk with me or just smile me. My point of view is each person need to empathize with everyone know more people try to make new friend but always show like we are.

751,2010,DB69B98973B6,"One topic that is frequently debated today is if schools should be allowed to control students involvement in extracurricular activities. They think that sometimes students take too many extracurricular activities to the point that they do not have enough time to do their school work. They feel that extracurricular activities dont help students manage their time wisely. I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Firstly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to manage their time. It helps students learn how to manage their time by making them make a schedule. By making a schedule students learn how hard it is to an adult. Students make resposible actions and learn how much work they have to put in for them to be good in school. Extracurricular activities doesnt always take studenst time but prepares them for life Secondly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to make new friends. Extracurricular activities helps students how to communicate and make new friends while making good memories. Students shouldnt always be focused in school I believe that students should also have fun and friends. Friends will make school and other school related activities enjoyable for kids and teengers. Lastly extracurricular activities helps students make colleges be interested in them. Colleges get interested in you when they see all of the thinggs youve done althrought high school. If colleges see that youve a lot throught high school they would be even more interested in you. Colleges also check your grades and other stuff but the thing they check the most is extracurricular activities because they want to see if you were consistant. As you have read I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Only when we let our students choice they would resposible and wise.

Having the time off can be people to catch with work if they are behind or for teenagers to catch up with homeworks. School sometimes can be exhausting because some people could be depressed or stressed out to get their things done. Everyone can run out of energy especially when everybody expects for you to do good. Every single member of your family is always telling you to do good just to get things in life is very stressful. Working hard through four days it is more then enough to get work done if you put your mind to it. People need the extra time to relax, because it is not good for the body mentally and physically. Working too much causes stress and grueling because thinking too much about work and worrying about the bills that they have to pay. By being worried too much can even cause you to go to the hospital so it would be not be good for your health. When you think about the things you have to do to support yourself you have to put yourmind to it and not slack if you want that advantage of thedays you are going to have work. In conclusions I agree because people should have more time to relax and not stressed about their jobs and what they have to do. People get exhausted and start to worry about all of their responsabilities they have to do. Working for 10 hours is more then enough for a person. Sometimes teeagers and adults carry many preoccupations that they shouldnt worry about but they have to if it envolves them. Schools should be the same and not be so stressful, it could be dangerous to stress and not sleep because they worry about the responsabilities that have to be done.",8,8,8,8,8,6,1329,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
756,3331,CF288DDE1328,"Most student enjoy summer vacations, but some educators believe that summer break is too long and that students do not retain information easily. Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. It can sound exagerate but that wouldnt be much time to us for do our sumer change. First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the ""suffer"" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. What educators dont see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I coulnt do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us wouldt provide the same amount of aventures. More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldnt make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students whos choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school. On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times dont remenber thing that I sow the year before. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the ones who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig. In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year. Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. I beliebe that we things shouldnt change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.",7,7,7,7,6,6,2852,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
757,2430,043B9F48FDC2,"Should all the students have to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Or should it be an electives and they could be able to make their choice to take what they want. I believe that everyone have different opinion , interest, or things they want to do. They are able to make their on decision but i dont think that it has to be required to take a class that some people arent interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldnt take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and theres not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didnt want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why dont you go to that class and he was like i dont like the class, i dont enjoy it at all and also i didnt choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you dont even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like its your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me. But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now hes taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because its really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i dont know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i dont like because id rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look theres a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you dont want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i dont like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up. We should be able to choice what we want to study we dont have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we dont want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they dont know that they have to take some classes they dont even want to take then those type of things make people think thats why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just dont want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just dont feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just dont care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they dont think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it. Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then theres when the things starting coming out. Becuase they dont like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you cant do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students. Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if theres a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldnt be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldnt take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just dont like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own.",6,6,6,6,6,7,50,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
758,3082,D5202DF530D1,"I feel like people making their own decisions will be a lot better for that person. But seeking guidance is that bad either for someone to make their own decisions says to someone else that they know what they are doing and can build something great with how their working and planning for the future. Although seeking guidance is the worst thing to do, i feel like people making decisions for themselves is better. For example if i were to go to someone for guidance or for something more and they give me some sort of guidance or idea and it turn out bad for me. Than i would never be able to go another person for guidance and ideas and i would most likely turn to myself. Then theres the problem that the reason that i went to seek guidance was because i couldnt make a decision for myself and now since Im self reliant it will be hard for me to make my own decisions. Now if i didnt go to the authorities and experts and made the decision for myself but it still ended up being bad outcome. It still would have been a lot better for me so that i can use the experience of making my own decision to help make better one in the future. Now if you go to the authorities and experts to seek guidance and it it come out great and now your life is going great. Until the time to make your own decision it will be even harder to make then the time you went for guidance. That you yourself will fell behind and lose whatever chance that you had because you never made a decisions for yourself and thats problem some people have because they have been going to someone else to make your life decisions. In conclusion to go somewhere to seek guidance isnt bad its what comes out of it to help you if it turns out bad or good it will effect your decision making to be better and worst. In my opinion making your own decision will be better then any expert ideas because it help yo in your life and what comes after every decision you make for better or worst.

No, because it is not very active socially and physically, unlike going to school, interacting with people, and playing sports. Also, if the internets not working then the student would have to skip the class because internet is what loads the videos and is used for face timing with the students. Some students cant learn just by watching a video or taking an online class, they have to actually experience the situation to understand. But the majority of the students can learn from videos and online classes.

Personally for me, I like using technology for projects it helps me get more information more quickly. It is faster and easier to look up things about my topic. The internet is a good source to use because it has a lot of information and different things. For example I did a project for history and I used the internet to do it. My topic was about Anna Frank and her dad and what she went though as a little girl at a young age and how she died and why it was remembered and why we still talk about It. This project was all online and we had to use special website to use for the project. All my articles were online and ive learn more about the holocaust it was and about what happened to Anna Frank. I read a lot of articles and books of her. people can check out books,shop,and play games with out speaking to another person. Books are very good sources to get information from. If people go to the library they have sections like fiction or non-fiction and many more and helps people explore and find books they are looking for. They can look around and pursues books and take it home and read it. They can play games with out talking to each other.

762,2096,DACE7A4DE7DB,"I agree with this statement, because a positive attitude helps you cope more easily with the daily affairs of life. It brings optimism into your life, and makes it easier to avoid worries and negative thinking. If you adopt it as a way of your life, it would bring constructive changes into your life, and makes them happier, brighter and more succesful. Whith a positive attitude you see the bring side of life, become optimistic and expect the best to happen. It is certainly a state of mind that is well worth developing. Also a positive attitude leads to happiness and sucess and can change your whole life. If you look at the bright side of life, your whole life becomes filled with light. This light affects not only you and the way you look at the world, but it also affects your enviroment and the people around you. If this attitude is strong enough, it becomes contagious. Its as if you radiate light around you. When you are positive, you tend to pull yourself out of negative loop and dont lose focus from what you really want to achieve, the person with a positive attitude has a better perspective of life. understand that is important to take resposibility for ones actions for example: problems in your work, family, school etc. A strong sence of responsibility always envokes positive and constructive actions. A positive thinker is never impulsive, they always wait to get clarity of a particular situation. Being positive and calm always enable you to see both sides of the coin. Positive attitude is the key to sucess in lifen because if you are positive you will belive and trust yourself, and you wont let negative people affect your deams, if not you will work hard until you get them and go will sucessful.

763,2739,4FD4CE18CCDF,"I think seeking multiple opinions would be better, because you can actually view multiple perspectives and then decide which one is the best. For example, you can make a list of pros and cons to see which one you like the most. Or, you can take a vote on what to do. You will also be able to listen better and be more supportive of other people. You will as well as compromise better with multiple people rather than one specific person. For example, lets say someone wants a dog. He or she is going to have to listen to many peoples opinions about having a dog. One person could say, ""Having a dog is a very big responsability. So dont get one unless you ready to take on the risks for it."" Another person could say, ""Its really easy to own a dog. All you have to do is feed it, wash it, play with it, take it out on a walk, and clean its mess."" After he or she listens to both people, he or she makes a pros and cons list and decides which side has more and which one is the best. Another example, someone wants to play a sport, but it can be too dangerous. One person says, ""Dont do it. Its not worth risking your life and slowly dying in the hospital."" Another person says, ""Do it! Its not only fun, but it can also help you be more cooperative and you are being active."" Again, someone can agree with both answers, so thats why people need to compromise, to both get what they want. One example of a compromise, you want to watch the new movie Billy Madison. However, you are underage. It can work out if you ask someone if he or she has ever seen the movie. If yes, ask he or she if theres any scene okay for your age. If yes, you will probably be able to only watch the movie once. Otherwise, you are goind to have to wait until youre at the age. Another example is, you want to stay up. However, your parents never let you. You can talk to them and see if they can let you stay up for at leat just one night. If youre lucky, you will probably be able to stay up during the weekend. But never on a school night. Thats why I think seeking advice from multiple people is a better choice. Not only it will help you more, but, it can also teach you how to deal with real-life situations. Also compromising and making a list will help you with that. It will as well teach people how to listen better and be more supportive of others. Then you decide whether if its right or wrong.

The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that . Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom. Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classrooms people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time. Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need. Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that its, because that would wast all classs time, and students have more options to search online for their class work. We all must respect peoples, teachers, and our time in classroom by not use cell phone to distract and lose the attendances benefit in classroom.",7,6,7,7,5,5,2152,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

773,2538,076262AA0CD5,"The Curfews Keep Teenagers Out Of Trouble Once, I walked down the empty street during midnight. Then, I heard a rising sound of a strange footstep behind me. Suddenly, I felt anxious and scared that someone might come up to me and murder me for money. Lucikly, there was nothing happened to me. After I got home, I had a thinking that what if a city council adopts a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. If the curfew is published, any teenager who is wandering on the street after those hours would be violating the law. On the other hand, some might believe that the curfews unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because it does not let the teenagers have their freedom and accomplish something that is very important to them, which they cannot do it another time. I still agree with the idea that curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because it stops teenagers from doing something that is illegal during the late hours, it moderates them to be a better humans being with molarity without having any criminal records, and it prevents young people from being kidnapped or killed at night. Some people argue that curfews should not be publish because it limits the freedom of most teenagers. Still, I believe that curfews should be establish to put an end on any illegal act that is commited by teenagers because the young people should be controlled by laws when most of them are not mature enough. They should be strictly managed instead of being free and are allowed to do whatever they want. For example, teenagers who hangout with their friends at night and get drunk are more likely to do something that is breaking the law when they are not sober enough. These young people tend to pull out their weapons to threat others who walk outside at night for money in order to buy illegal drugs. This is an important issue to pay attention on because these teenagers already become the worst humans being when they are not strictly managed by anyone or any law. However, they will keep threatenting others when the curfews arent carried out to prevent them from doing their vicious things. In fact, there are several criminal cases that are committed by teenagers in America, which proves that the U.S. government is weak at controling their citizens and managing the society within the nation. This fact shows that the U.S. government does not care about the moral of young citizens and the safety of all citizens in general. The U.S. government should carry out curfews that keep all teenagers in control in order to limit any illegal acts. The estalishment of curfews is important because it shapes all teenagers to become the better people who has morality instead of threatening others to get what makes them feel pleasure. The curfews should be carrried out to moderate all teenagers into better people who treats others in the right way because it helps them stay out of any trouble that might be an unfortunate consequense in their future. It shapes their morals and erases all their bad behaviors that makes others feel unpleasure. For example, teenagers who turn out to be good people when they have parents who do not let them go out when the sky turns dark. Also, their parents strictly manage them and prevent them from going outside at night to do illegal things. However, some might believe that the curfews do a little improvement on teenagers because they still sneak out of their houses without their parents awakeness to do what they like at night. This is an important issue to focus on because these teenagers will turn into adults who have several criminal records that might bother them from getting their jobs in the future. Moreover, teenagers should be more mature to realize that any violation acts that they had done will stay with them for the rest of their lives. Therefore, if the curfews is adopted then they should be obey to this law in order to avoid any unfortunate results that can occur in their lives. In fact, many companies prefer to choose employees with a good moral because they did not commit any crime in the past, which proves that they will not cause any danger while working in the companies. Unfortuantely, people who had done any crime or violated any law in the past will more likely to stay unemployed because they are considered to be dangerous. The curfews is brought out to protect all teenagerss future from being damaged by any of their wrongful commitment. The curfews keep teenagers out of trouble because most of them would not want to be kidnapped or murdered while walking on the street at night. To prevent any harmful cause that can happen to young people, the U.S. government should set up curfews for teenagers. In fact, there are many unfortunate cases of missing teenagers in America. This fact proves that numerous teenagers had been kidnapped while they wander around empty public places at night. In this case, the U.S. government should adopt curfews law because it can decrease the act of kidnapping teenagers. However, some teenagers are killed while they are going out at night because there are a lot of robbers appear during this time. To solve this problem, the U.S government should let the city council bring out the curfews law, which can restricts all teenagers from going out at night and protect them from being murdered. In conclusion, curfews law is significant because it can reduce the criminal acts within a society. It shapes the society to be more organized and less dangerous to the citizens. The curfews can keep teenagers out of trouble because it restricts teenagers from committing any unfortunate crime. It helps teenagers to become better individuals in society who treat others in a correct way. Specially, teenagers can avoid death and being kidnapped when they obey to the curfews and stay home at night. Lastly, we should set up curfews and believe that it can protect all teenagers from getting trouble because they are going to be the one who runs the planet one day.",8,9,9,9,9,9,99,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

However everyday people say he is the president because we need him no because we want he lider us. This demostrate how you can have a good career or power, but if your attitude is unpleasant although they need it never gonna like you.

776,2217,55C7EC027A88,"Lately many people have said students should have a shorter summer vacation about 45% of people have. They think it would be better for students so they dont forget what they learn the year before when the come back in the fall. They think students should have year-round schools, but is that a really good idea? Well here are many reasons why there shouldnt and why it would be a horrible idea. Many people think that students shouldnt have to year-round schools because the students might have a summer job, Its no enough time, they shouldnt have to worry school for that long, and its just too many things for them to remember. Many students normally middle schoolers and high schoolers have to work during the summer. Many students have to work after school and its just to much for them. Some might work because the need to help their families with money, others to buy something they really want or need, and some is so when they get out of high school and they can have enough money to get into collage. Whatever the reason may be they need the three month summer vacation so they can have more money to do whatever they need with it and have a year-round school will not help them because after work they need to do homework. About 85% of students that work and have go to go school will have to stay up really late so they can do thier homework. Students often do not get enough sleep. They stay up late night hours doing homework , project or studying. In reality its just too much work for students to keep up with school for that long. A three to four weeks for summer vacation is just not enough for students, not even teachers. They deserve a longer summer vacation after all the hard work they have done for those nine months, the least they could get is a three month vacation. They just need to relax and take care of themselves because they sometimes be stressing out too much. Which that could lead to bad health and many other problems. They need a longer vacation because three to four week is not enough. What if they want to travel they cant not for long so they cant really enjoy it. They also need to spend more time with their families, many just dont be as close to them because they are too focus in school. They just a well needed vacation of no more stress for three months. Another reason why a year-round school is not the greatest idea is that its just too much for students and teachers to remember. Students already need to remember a lot to pass the SOL. Having a year of school will just keep adding too that. Its also a lot of work for students to be doing. A lot of worksheets, tests, quizes, projects, and for teachers too they need to be planning the next class and need to be grading a lot of papers. Plus another thing to think of is what about summer school? For the students that didnt pass the SOL or the class. When or how will they have the time to pass? Theres a lot of things that should be planned out first. On the other hand I get why it would be nice to be in a year-round school. Students wouldnt forget as much things. Normally when students come back in the fall they are clue-less of what the learned three months ago. A year-round school will decrease that. Students would also get to see their friends more. Often many students dont get to see their friends during summer vacation. For the students that need it, they could get extra help. Also for the students that really like to learn new things this would be a great time too. However even though all that would be kind of nice. We dont know if the decrease of students forgetting things will actually work because not many students even touch their backpack during any vacation so they would most likely will forget a lot of things either ways. Nowdays even though students might not see their friends. They still manage to text or facetime. Maybe some students might have a car and will be able to go vist them or hang out for a bit. If students need extra help they can get a tourter for that extra help that they may need and if we have a year-round school for them it wouldnt be fair for the other students that do not need that extra help. If they really want to learn new things they can go to classes somewhere for whatever they would like to learn. Its just more better having a three month break. Thats why there shouldnt have a year-round school there just wouldnt be much of benefits. Itll most likey stay with the same problems or even worse. Thats why there should be a year-round school because students might have a job, its not enough time for them, they shouldnt have to worry about school for that long, and they just would have to remember too many things.",8,7,8,8,7,6,1112,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Although, it may seem that trying is hard and its a waste of time, it is actually true that trying can make you achieve your goals. Trying my hardest showed me who I really am. I accomplished some of my goals, but I always try to be inspired. This helped me get through my problems. None of my goals have been easy, theyre hard, but that doesnt stop me. My plan is to be successful in life and not to be a failure. Sometimes I loose and sometimes I win. I used to be 275 pounds, I wasnt happy with the way I looked. I also experience random pain in my heart. My body was telling me to start loosing weight. I really wanted to go and loose all of my weight, but my lazy side said to just sit in the couch and play video games all day. I had to get my life together and started going to the gym, the following day. Day by day, I started to feel something different. I felt more energetic and strong. I ate healthy and those heart pains were gone. My parents were always there for me to encourage me. I also wanted to be an example to my little brother that anything is possible, as long as you try. I lost 58 pounds to be exact. I feel lighter than ever. I went beyond my limits to accomplish my goal. All hard work always rewards you as it did for me. My reward was having cheat days. I always love cheat days because you can forget about your diet for a day and eat whatever you want. Cheat days are the best to have, but not all the time. You can loose track and fall. Accomplishments are hard to achieve, but its a lot of fun to do them. They can make you a better person and makes your life so much easier. As long as you try your best, you can do anything.

Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think im already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I dont need to go school again just to spend money ,Im good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didnt talk to him about careers when he was at school. One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,thats why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career. Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids Im not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didnt have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didnt have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesnt have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",7,7,6,6,5,6,2683,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on peoples lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans. Although some people says that technology had positive effects on peoples lives, actually technology can have negative effects on peoples lives because technology cause addiction to peoples. Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesnt cause negative effects on peoples lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on peoples lives. First reason, why does technology had negative effects on peoples lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology . Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents. The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on peoples lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They cant stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.

Advice is something you seek, and search you can ask advice on anything it can be advice for you hair, advice for you dog, doctor advice you can partially ask advice on anything. When people are searching for advice they usually ask more than one person, I think thats best, because you can see from different points of views. I think only taking one persons advice may not help you find a solution or a make a good a choice, another positive thing about asking advice is you can also learn something new or meet someone new.

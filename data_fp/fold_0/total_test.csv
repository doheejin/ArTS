1,1,920BEE439862,"I believe Thomas Jefferson is right. If we are always doing something we get things done faster and there is possiblilities of starting new things. Why should we wait to finish something we can finish the same day, we never know what can happen. I also believe the inactivity is good not only does it give a chance to rest but we also can think through our ideas. We can perfect things we didnt think we could. It can give a chance to see different views of are own ideas. Maybe taking a break can refresh are memories and remind us how important things are to us. Woring all the time can exshuased ours bodys and make us think a little less. With a fresh mind set it can make things easier than we thought. Sometimes we over thinks that arent that big of a deal and a big part of it comes from not taking the time to rest and refresh our memories. Many people would agree with Thomas Jefferson just like I do but would also agree that taking time to rest is also getting things done.

2,2,FFDC4011AC9C,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"" What I think about that quote is that you cant do your best in every problem. If your still stuck on what it even means like I was in the first few minutes of seeing that, It means that in every challenge you see in life there is always a way to try your best and get through that challlenge, dispite what your mind tells you because your mind is your biggest enemy you will ever face. I dont particularly agree with that quote jsut because in certain problems even if you try your best you will still fail or if you just dont want to do the problem or other people around you dont then you most likley fail to. What im trying to get at to this quote is that instead of being ""For every problem there is a chance for you to do your best"" it should be ""For every problem or challenge there is always a way to get thorugh it"". Here is a few examples: If your dying from old age and your deadline is going to be this week. Then just die you get around the challlenge by dying because in most relgions there is something called heaven so you can die and go to heaven. Another example: Facing a hard question, just guess! Youll have a 1/4th chance of getting it right and if you just guess it would be bettter then sitting on the problem for 20 minutes.

I believe that technology has a positive effect on peoples lives in many ways. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has a positive effects on peoples lives. The reason why technology has a positive effect on people is because it makes most peoples life easier and therere cars that drive for you. For example, now a days you can order your grocery online and just pick it up at the store in a certain amount of time. This type of service allows people to be more confident on technology and it saves you some time. Therefore, manny people take advantage of the technology and use it for goods. In adition to that, technology allows you to get to place faster and safer. For example, they have cars that are design to drive by themselves. This is a positive effet because some people dont like driving in traffic and they now have the car to do that for them. Therefore, when you are in a party and you had drank toomuch you can call a taxi or if you have an advance that can drive by itself, you can take it. Therere many ways technology can be helpfull in society. In clonclusion technology can be a positive and negative effect in peoples lives.

5,5,85E3C840FCBF,"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators. One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasnt a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies. Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They wont be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching. Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",5,6,6,5,7,6,1769,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

7,7,F9D0974B3AF7,"I disagree about extending school because,Parents might want to spend time with their kids after school on a regular day after school and if school was extended parent might have already gone to work by the time you get home. Parents might have done an appointment with a doctor right after a regular day at school,but if the time extended at school the doctor might have already closed. kids would want to get out of school to talk with their friends or have fun doing what they like best. The teachers might not get paid more then a normal day at school. Teachers should get paid more if school was extended. I would not like school to get extended because,I have more important things to do after school like taking care of my brother or take care of my dogs. My parents are never home and my older sister is. My parent tell me to help my sister clean the house after school but when i get home she never cleans until before my parents come, and if school was extended she would never clean the house and my parents would already be heading home.

Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision. if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future. If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility. If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up. if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers. so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work.

The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody. As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow.""

14,14,FD9A86C8DA31,"I do agree with Churchill statement because life aint easy and you will lose a lot to order to became successful in life.

This made me go harder for what I want to became in life I really put all my effort into something I love playing since my childhood , it always kept me from trouble and ending up in the street. I remember when I was 13 years old I use to play for a really good team that I never thought I could make but I did and never had a changes to play on the field because the coach thought I wasnt ready to play. He use to doubt about my ability on the field and that put me down , I left the team then stop playing for 6 months but I was start to think that I shouldnt give up and 2 months later I made Super Y where all the good player are at and good teams . I only played 6 games and i didnt do good or bad but I did alright and one of the coaches love my playing style , he got me on a travel team. My first season was where I proved everybody wrong and scored 38 goals 16 assist , I was proud of myself for not giving up and kept my head up from what I was going thought , Next season I got called up to play for the first team I was amaze for what I accomplish in a year. It was amazing when I played for the first team because I went to tournaments that were big like the state cup and college showcases I never experience , my team came in first place for two season and almost won state cup. The next year I made NPL and been getting mail from academy team and one team from Spain to go play for them but I lost those changes and that when I just stop giving up because money was a issue and I was begin to get in trouble that when I lost it all the hard work for nothing. I had my hope up for things to get better and one day I was listing to my coach , he told me I was a amazing player and I changes the game every time im on the field then he told me dont give up on something you really good at cause I can see you going pro or playing division one soccer and get draft from there , so I listed and now I got 5 division one school that went me to play for there school and some others. This is why I agree with this statement because if you lose faith in yourself you will never became successful in something you love doing and playing even if it gets hard keep your head up and focus on the main goal to become successful. This rapper said "" at your best you are love and dont let nobody pull you from your grind"" and I like what that quote say because it true once you became big everybody you know that talk upon your name and never been by your side will come back and say how they use to know.

I heard story of a guy he fail a lot but he didnt gave up because he was still interested on the experiment, so he failed like 408 time I think and he passed at 409th times so you can imagine that he was still exited and interested on that experiment that he failed 408 times and he got success at 409 times. So in life when people failed on something they move on because they might not be interested or exited on that thing that they have failed but many other people will keep trying until they havent achieve it. they will keep trying because they love it or they are still exited on that work that they have failed. I know some people dont like doing one thing again and again but if you want to be success in life you have to keep doing it until you havent achieve it because you cant be success in life without being a failure. when people failed on something they might say that its hard and i am not gonna do it again because they didnt try their best on it, but if you keep trying you will get some hint on it and it will be easier to achieve what you working on.

Working as a group isnt bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits. Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused. Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also its hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group.

18,18,638D7F913AAB,"Do you think the greatest accomplishment in the world is to be yourself in a world that is trying to change the person you are?, because I do not think people should change themself ever for what god brought us in the world for who we are and not changing ourself for others. So yes, I agree with Emerson statement about individuality, because people in this world are trying to change themselfs for others or just changing themselfs because they dont like themselfs for who they are. There are so many reasons why I agree with this statement especially in todays society that most people in this world are changging themselfs for someone else. I dont agree with the fact that people have the courage to change for others, because in any case they should just be thereselfs and love them for who they are, is the greatest accomplishment and feeling ever. It is the greatest accomplishment because of the feeling that you loved yourself and secceeded without someone bringing you down and making you change yourself is the best feeling to feel. Otherwise the people who are trying to bring you down are winning and you are giving them the power that they should not have. In todays generation with all the social media we have people that have been rude and comment someting bad to make you feel bad about yourself and then some people change themself just because of a comment that could hurt someone. But if you can secceed people will leave you alone, because they know you will not listen to the rude comments you would recive and there just wasting there time. So then you have the power and accomplished the negetivity that people are trying to change yourself. Also being yourself does not mean you wont have mistakes because everyone does and that is okay just without you changging yourself and accomplishing thing is the best part of life. It is okay to have mistakes because everyone learns from them and next thing they will do better then the last time they did something bad or had a mistake. People will go through tough times but it does not mean you should automatically change yourself for that. Everyone goes threw a situation that they probebly think they hate themself and wanna change the person they are, but I think that is wrong and they should be thereselfs and understand that everything will be alright at the end without them trying to change themselfs. In my opinion I do not think that changing yourself will help with anything and I think it would probebly make things worst. LIke for an example if you change yourself nothing is gonna happend just you letting yourself down and changing who you are that should not have been in that situation. Also people would most likely notice and ask why you change yourself and that would bring back memories and make you go back in time and see why you change yourself. But if you dont change yourslef no one would know and wont bring up any badly past back memories. Also mistakes can happend and if you change yourself and go back and see old pictuers of you of how you used to be you might not like for who you are now and you cant go back because you change yourself for someone you did not want to be I mean you could always try but why try after you did it and cant go back. So just be you and do not change for others who are constantly trying to make you something else who it isnt you. It is such an amazing feeling and more people in this world would be great if they wouldnt change for someone else because they would get the confidence and not worrying about what others has to say about them. People would most likely be so positive if they would be themself and not changing constantly or ever themselfs for people who are ignorent. People who love you would never say to change the person you are because that is just wrong and they know that they would not want to lose you as the person you are. So in all saying that everyone should not change and be themselfs in a world that is constantly trying to change them.

20,20,C66B4F537548,"I Believe people who have positive attitudes towards life, are one of the biggest keys to success in life. You will see your life in a different perspective, than people with negative attitudes. They doubt them selfs threw life and never reach there goals because they dont have a positive attitude. Youll never give up easily or at all, because you see that it will help by making you fill more accumplished with yourself by having a positive attitude. Having a positive attitude will also make you a good person. Youll show yourself and others how to change there attitude towards life. As you are accumplishing your own goals in life, you could be helping others do the same. So by helping people out with the way you see your life, you could help others reach the same goal on positive attitude with there lives. life its self, is the biggest challenge anyone can go threw. Where put threw challenges everyday with out even knowing, and get threw them no matter how hard it may be. By helping others it could make not just you seced in life but others as well. Even my family and I have been threw the worse. From living in rooms, basements, and being envicted from apartments because my parents wouldnt make enough money to keep us in one place. They were losing alot of hope with life and from ever being stable for there family, but me as the only boy in the family I had to keep my positive attitude in life for our family goal in reaching stablebility for my older and younger sibling and I. I would wake up on top of some folded blankets the hard wooden floor with my mom and dad aside me but I wouldnt care cause as long as I knew my little siblings were on the bed comfortbly sleeping it would make me feel good because I knew one day it was all going to change. Keeping my positive attitude with my life really helped me alot, because once I turned 16. I started to work at Mcdonalds everday after school from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for five days a week. Everytime I got payed I would save up my checks because I knew my parents never had good cars. We would always buy junky cars off the road, because we could never afford new cars. So I set my self a goal on buying my parents a new car, because I knew it could help them out. By not spending on old cars, I also knew they could never save up from all the stuff they had to pay and such. There were many days at work where I wanted to quit, but I would always look on how my family and I lived. Also on how much my parents struggled just to give us hot food on the table. So I always kept my positive attitude with me for my family. The day came after 1 year of working I had saved up over 10k for a new car for my parents and the family. My mom and my dad where so proud of me and told me they could never thank me enough for all the hard work I had put in everyday at work for the family. Me and my family started to gain hope on our family after they saw what a big change I had made to the family just by having a positive attitude. So my two oldest sisters and I where starting to save up for a home for the family and that too, we had accomplished. Now we have a home that we have been living in for 5 years now, everyone has there room I bought my self a car too. Life is good and I feel super successful with my life already. So yes, I do believe having a positive attitude is the key to a successful life. ",8,8,7,8,7,6,2693,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

22,22,E52ADC86DFFC,"Based on my experiences i would say that is not true because people always can change. Im my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them. The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change. One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment. If i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend. The first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer. To conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3305,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
23,23,2DAA07621328,"Technology is taking the must attention than the comunicacion with other peolpe. Technology allows to complete many task without having contact with other people. Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on peoples lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person. In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people dont talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you dont have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person. Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you dont have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it. Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesnt have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games. To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives. True technology is the future of the world but keep it in main how you can use the technology and the technology dont use you.

24,24,2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything. My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out. My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything. My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time. Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

25,25,6E842F21D6E4,"There are people in every part of the world that, they can not be retract based on what they say, or on what they have done as a result of their acts giving in their first impressions. The first impressions can give to a people in a idea, feeling, or an opinion. A people can hurt someone else feeling based on their opinion, because they do not think what adequate words they going to say. And when they want to fix the problem may be too late. The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change. First impressions can hurt peoples feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings. Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change. Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big. Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.

28,28,64A8183557F7,"Should students graduate in three years? Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year. Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students dont know what career they want or they dont know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesnt know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesnt know what to study and cant find a job yet. Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old. Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes. In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.

People now are smart and makes wise decisions on their daily basis. However, people tend to take risk upon their decisions without any consultancy with experts and authorities. People should always seek guidance from experts and authorities whenever they are making any big decisions. It will be more easier for them to choose options when they seek guidance from someone who already knows about it. People often tend to make wrong decisions when they make decisions by themselves. A lot of celebrities have their personal guidance which is their manager. Manager makes a thoughtful decisions for celebrities to keep them on track of their career. If celebrities tend to make their own decisions many celebrities would go downfall in their career. The decisions people make should be thoughtful and have guidance from experts. Christopher from into the wild book, he is one of the example for to take advise from experts or else people will end up like Chris. Christopher did not take any guidance from anyone while going into the wild of Alaska alone. He did not have any good materials to take with and didnt ask for help. MC candles died into the wild of Alaska because he was not prepared for the trip he was going into. This is exactly why people should take advise, if he would have taken any advice what so ever he would most likely have survived in the Alaska wilderness. He chose not to take any guidance which is the reason he died into the wilderness. Everyone wants to have a successful life but not everyone gets it.

32,32,A9A6B5A288DC,"Should some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students best effort. They believe that students must be self-confident in order to learn. I agree with students must be self confident because its better to grow in life then stay in the same place over and over again. If a student does not believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that students life time. Also a builds a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. Students should have self-esteem for a successful life. If a student doesnt believe in what he or she can do then that student will not be able to compete things in that students life time. Student that doesnt think that their capable of doing more that student will stay the same and would not be able to grow, also that student self-esteem will lower down. Another thing a student should getting moving up and high than he or she can do is there are no limits in what that person can do if the student knows that they would be able to do what they can do they can easily grow by practicing more and believing they can do it. So by not believing in what he or she can do that will affect what will happen later in life, never stop believing in what he or she can do as a student. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward. To have a good self-esteem the student will have to set up goals to show to their self that that student can do more. Another thing after writing down their goals is which one will they do first or which one is do he or she want to compete first. With all the choices to choose like for example: goals, friends or family that support, or how will is the student want to succeed, because even if they dont try as hard as they know how to it could happen to anyone in life that shouldnt make a student to stop trying it should make them feel like okay it wasnt my best my first time he or she can get the second time because a student should always chase what they are willing to have. Building a great mindset for the student to keep moving forward is good for a student to have a great self-esteem. The reason students should be praising for their self-esteem is, because no students should say no to even if its not their best work the first time everyone should have a chance to have a great self-esteem and to keep growing in life.",5,4,6,4,4,5,2268,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
33,33,FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do. The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports. Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people. If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldnt be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student cant join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too. Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage. If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career.

34,34,DE8EAEAC72D9,"Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you dont have to worry about for college. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines. The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and dont need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you cant stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because hes so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two. The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you dont then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff. The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you dont have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you dont have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you cant stop because people that put the work they dont stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others dont because the were born with golden life. Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something dont have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didnt so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that dont wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.

An old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life. I would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. To lose someones honesty is very hard I have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. My father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. My father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. Even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. But when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someones feelings. I once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feelings on my team. But a persons honesty can always change at all times. I once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. I even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. As we can see you might be able to get something from being honest. If you are always honest people respect you. I have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. When you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you.

Honesty is the best policy because it impacts you to do the right thing and creates a good environment. When being honest it shows that you have a high self steam which is can be very good for you in the long run.

Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them.

42,42,F99B20789DD7,"Dear Schoolboard, I think that school should not be extended. students need to have a long break at home because they might have after school clubs to attend to. I think students should not have extended school because they are not going to pay attention to the teacher they need to rest their brains for a long time since you are in school for 7 hours. Another reason why i think students should not have extra time at school is because kids have to wake up early and they are tired so they wont pay attention since they dont get enough sleep. The other reason why i think school should not be extended is because the students most of them do not pay attention so typically the teacher is wasting her time trying to teach them. Also why i think they should not extend school is because if the day is longer they are going to need more breaks during the day and it takes a little long to go back in the building. On the other hand i think they should have a extended school because they will know their subjects faster and that will make the school year faster. Another reason why i think they should extend school is because the students are really bored at home and they wish to learn instead of being home board. The last reason why I think school should be extended is because kids might not pay attention during the day so with the extra hour they might want to pay attention and they will learn a little. The last reason why i think school should be extended is because the students do things outside of home that are not good for them like doing challenges,steeling or getting into fights outside of school which can cause them injuries. The other reason i think they should extend school is because students would or will have a better education so that when they are grownups they will find a job that pays you more than the others.

44,44,F7B478DB88ED,"We are living in a world full of possibilities in the day to day basis, where we could decide wether to go to Paris the next day or stay at home sleeping in bed. The question is what would be a better decision in this set of crossroads. What would make the most out of our short lives we have of living. Perhaps youll be surprised of how much yoou can accomplish in this lifespan. Being active on a day to day basis has proven to create more happiness and more ""success"" throughout peoples lifes. I think the many witnesses we have of people who have lived a ""succesful"" life is enough of an example. We have heard stories of so many different people who have stood out on their field; celebrities, journalists, corporation leaders, etecetera. What do all of these people have in common? They never backed down from their dreams and took every step in their life in action towards that dream. People like Steve Jobs couldve stayed in the comfort of their homes, idle, to the outside world and the possibilities that they had to create something that would transcendentaly change the world. But they decided otherwise, because of their denial to idealness they shaped and transformed the 21st century world as we know it. All the people who we remember and our taught about in our history classes, decided to live their lifes taking action to make a change. But many times we dont have a goal to find the motivation to take action towards our life. It should be reminded that the actions we take dont have to be for our own desires. Instead taking action and denying to be ideal allows us the possibility of one of the greatest sources of happiness: service to others. We are constantly battered by a world that seems more disastrious everyday, everytime we watch the news we seem to be living in world full of lies and grief. Where innocent people suffer the consequences of actions that are not their own. By denying to idleness and reflecting about the world we live in, we allow ourselves to create an impact on other peoples lives. Spreading joy and happiness and making a mark on their lives. While also creating happiness and fulfillment in our own lives. Perhaps a more gruesome but at the same time important way to analyze the denial to idleness is asking ourselves these questions: ""When I leave this earth, what do I want to leave behind?"""" What do I want my legacy to be?"". Hopefully your answer isnt nothing. Because wether we believe it ourselves or not we all have the capacity, capability, and opportunity to leave a legacy that we are proud of. We are all the determinants of our legacy. Wether it be something of large scale involving the whole world or something related to your best friend. We are all most likely to want for people to remember us. Perhaps its something chemical in our brains that makes us want this or perhaps we want to know that the time we spent on Earth was of some value. Perhaps in our last hours of living we want the reassurance of this very thing. And the only way to know that we will feel that satisfaction is by taking action today, no matter where you are or what youre doing. After all when people were asked in their last hours of living what do they regret doing, they said that they do not regret doing anything, that insted they regretted not doing the things they couldve done. Taking action is the way to leave footprints on this earth, by taking steps forwards, backwards, to the right and left. And perhaps more than one of those steps will be facing the wrong direction but its important to remind ourselves that we have to keep walking because thats the only way we will realize how much we can accomplish. Taking action in your everyday lfe and the denial of idleness allows you the possibility to create the world you once thought you could only imagine. By stepping out and seeing what life has to offer wether that be a flower or a river, it is what allows us to accomplish our goals. And the denial of idleness helps you realize that theres people out there who want your joy put out on this world. So my last question to you is: When you wake up tomorrow, will you take a step forward?",7,7,8,7,8,7,3705,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

47,47,185E2F7317F2,"A problem is something that can make a difference in your life and can also teach you. I was in walmart one day, than I saw a man with small legs and Generic_Name started make fun of how the man walked, talked, and the man heard him he asked Generic_Name if he wanted to do a biking raise with him, Generic_Name said yes, they did the raise and the man with small legs own. After that Generic_Name never made fun of anyone he saw. A problem is a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teach you. First of all, a problem can change your life. Oneday I was at walmert and Generic_Name was telling his story of the past. He said, I used to steal, tell lies, I didnt listen to anyone and I also didnt work. One day, we went on a family vacation, on our way back we got hit by a truck and I was the only one who surived in that accident. After that, I wanted to take my life, for I didnt see the reason of living anymore. Six months passed, and nothing was working in my life. Then oneday I went to the beach planing to take my own life he said, when I started walking toward the water I saw a man sitting in the sand. He asked me, who are , my name is Generic_Name I said, and I started telling the man my story. Then the man said, your life matters the reason why you survived the accident that night is because it wasnt your time yet, your life matters because you are still breathing said the man, that is a gift because there are people out there wishing they dont have machines helping them to breath. These words changed my life, he said, I didnt forget about my family but I fixed my life for the good. This evidence shows that Generic_Name used to steal, tell lies, didnt work and didnt listen to anyone, his family got into a care accident and he was the only one that surived, he wanted to take his own life but all that changed when he met a man at the beach who opened his eyes. clearly, a problem is something that can take your life to the next level. In addition, a problem can teach you. There was this man named Generic_Name, he was a faithful man he helped people in need with what he had, Generic_Name had eleven children, five boys and six girls. All his children were trained to help people in need. One day, something happened, a messanger came to Generic_Name and told him that his house was set one fire, and his children were in there. Everything that Generic_Name owned was destroyed, Generic_Name, who was Generic_Names wife, was not pleased with what happened. Generic_Names friends told him to repent maybe he did something bad to his God, but he said he didnt sin against anyone, his wife told him to curse God and he will die , but Generic_Name didnt. Oneday Generic_Name got really mad that he shouted at God and when he did that he remembered years ago, Generic_Name promised to give a family some food and kept saying I will give you some food I promised, but Generic_Name will always forget. The whole family died because of Generic_Name. When he remembered this Generic_Name asked forgiveness to God, and he forgave Generic_Name. Everything he had was restored. This evidence shows that Generic_Name lost everything he had, but at last he remmbered his mistake and asked for forgiveness. Clearly, we can learn from our problems. Inconclusion, a problem can be a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teacher to you. If you ever found yourself in a sitaution like Generic_Names remember your life matters and dont forget the promises you give to people because it can destroy your life.

48,48,0AFAD06336F3,"Attending classes from home is not a good idea. I think its better to attend classes at school for many reasons that I have experienced at home. Its not fun becuase you dont have any teacher to explain to you what you dont understand (well you will have a teacher but he or she wont be there personally), you wont get any help from no one if your taking the online course. Also student will not benefit it because they will be off track and instead of doing there work or what they are suppose to be doing, they will be wondering around by the internet. I defenitly do not agree that the student will benefit attending classes at home. Having a tecaher with you in class is wonderful. There will be a point when you will have so many questions about the topic that you were discussing with the class. When your in class at school you will learn so much from teachers by giving out examples that are being giving out to the class and explaining it to you. But if your taking an online course Its defenitly more difficult for you to understand the main idea of the lesson. We wont have a teacher right next to us. We have to work indepentdently with out a friends help. Its not similar to when your in class and you ask a friend for help, they will love to help you out. Online class you wont have a friend helping you out. We have to take so many notes in order to understand the objective of the lesson. I personally had so much trouble with the online class, I had to take about 3-5 lessons each day, I had to write down notes for each lesson, I had to take at least five quizzes each day. I had to re-read the lesson like threes time in order to understand and capture the important facts. Honestly you learn how to be more organize and independent each day. I personally consider students to attend classes at school. Its not a good idea doing online class and taking so many notes. In class, tecahers are strict when student have there electonic out whil there tecaheing or when student are working on class work. At home and doing your class work and at the same time being on your phone, your not paying fully interest on your class, Since you home, dont have a teacher, you feel like you have the right to be on your phone and laptop and do what ever you want, and not doing you work. That shouldnt be the case if you stay home and take the online class, Its because to there was a purpose. If we dont pay attention to what we are doing, and we are paying more attention to our phones we will never learn anything abiut the course. That could cause use to fail the class. Than, we got to re-teake the class. In my opinion I will also agree to some student that wants to take the online class because you can wake up late, taking you time to eat breakfast. Its not like going to school having to get up so early, not having the time to eat, and having to chase the school bus. Im that type of person that loves to sleep. But its our responsibilty to do our work and tun it on time before the deadline. If you dont want to fail the class you have to save some time for your class than, you have to save some time for your self and for school work. Not all the time it will be about you. There needs to be some time for something else more important. In conclusion, I think Student will not benefit from able to attend classes at home. Its a lot of responsibility to remind your self that have to attend class at home, do all your work and turn it in on time. We wont have a teacher with us (personally), we have to do all our work independently. Thats why I think its not a good idea for students to attend classes at home.

51,51,9CE077EDCC85,The reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington quote . First this is a good quote for students who are always working hard and make a lot of mistakes because they get motivated from this quote. This quote can make someones day better . First reason is there a lot of people in the world who has a lot of problems. so I think that this quote would light up there day and make them fell better. second reason is that people that dose not have any problems could save this quote in there brains and when they are facing a problem they could use it to help them through that time and to do better. lastly I think when Duke Ellington was going through trough times he used his own straghe to help him to do his best and not give up. Next reason why you should agree with Duke Ellington is that when people have a lot of problems most of them just give up for example most people dose not have enough money to pay there bills some sell their house while others sell the cars and most people become homeless and live in the streets but if the hear this quote it might help them not to give up and do there best. My final reason why everyone should agree with Duke Ellington quote is its hard going through a problem because any thing can happen some people lose there jobs because of a problem.

52,52,56053054CB1F,"I believe that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it, The disicions you make can play a big role in how you turn out to be. For example the people you hang with, How you grew up and the type of household you were in, And my last example is is your motivation because being motivated can help you build good character traits for the future. The type of people you hang with play a big role in your character because you can pick up a lot of good and bad things from different people. They can influence you to do a lot and you know what they say ""you are who you hang with"" for example if you hang with people who do nothing but good you are going to want to do nothing but good but if you hang around people who are lazy and sit at home doing nothing with there day you are also going to become lazy and not motivated to do anything. The way you grew up and the type of household you were in also plays a big factor in your character because thats what you are around, Thats the energy with you all the time for example if your paerents are having problems at home all the time and you can become depressed and feel down all the time, Since thats the energy thats in the house, Which can make you start struggling in school since you would be down all the time. But on the other side if your household is very good, everyones happy and the vibe is good it can make you a very happy and positive person since thats all the energy youre getting, nothing but positive vibes and it can help you with school. Your motivation in my opinion is the most important part of building good character traits because its so good to be motivated and having a something to work for, If you have that the past does not matter and you can be the most awsome person that you can possibly be for example if you are really motivated you can become anything you want. Your past and all the things you overcame can motivate you another example is if you and your family is really struggling that is going to want you to push harder, And in that procces it would build a lot of good character traits that will be with you forever. In conclusion you make your character and choose the people you hang out with, The type of hpuse you are living in and the things that lead up to you being motivated and i dont think you can get influenced beyond your control because you can control everything you do for example if you dont like your friends switch things up, If you dont like how things are going at home go live with someone else. Everyone should always know that nobody can or should control you, Everyone makes choices bad or good you are the one who made that choice.

54,54,C92C73888D49,"In my opinion Thomas Jefferson wrote a statement that makes people think that, theres people out there who dont accomplish if we are doing something or we are not doing something. No one is grateful for peoples struggles and hard work they may thank you but they wont mean it. Imagine being in a world where people thank you for every single thing that makes you feel respected and needed for more work and accomplish what we suffer for and we do it because of the need of some personal struggles your going through. If humans were different by showing others there help and respectful this world would of make every single thing differently. Some people are accomplish of your hard work , some people never care others people hard work they just say thanks without meaning it and can say stuff behind your back. Although humans think they doing the right thing, they arent we should be a world without cruel no one knows how damage a person can be and fake it just because they want to accomplish the work they have to turn in or be finish with because they will know that if they dont finish the work it would be harder for them to get rid of you with your negativity. For example people dont serve Hispanics equally for differences but most of us have but our effort on work hard to earn some cents to take to our family but no one sees that all they do is put there own rude opinion on us. We shouldnt care what others say as long as you know your a great person with a huge heart your good. It would be wonderful how much may be done if we are always accomplishing others people work and being grateful for peoples effort, it would be a great idea if every single person listen to our life story before talking. Cant you imagine how many kids needs our help and we might see them with some eyes that we think there okay but they are really not. Humans have the benefit to change and become a different person and accomplish a goal to become someone grateful for little things and make the world a different place with different though. We should take a position to serve people with kindness, respect and give them a hand for there need of help sometimes helping others can make you a great person you can never know one day you will need the help of someone too and you will feel how much it hurts to not receive help from others or by someone you though wold of help you out you should always tell people how grateful you are for having them because they will realize you once helped them and they will help you out on the need of help, they will serve you as how you will serve them by now on, you cant judge a book by its cover, Thomas Jefferson wrote "" Determine never to be idle.."" and what i think about what that means is that you should not be ungrateful and you should help others, with simple words that are accomplishments. The studies of Thomas Jefferson old days history probably were different they did things differently and though different ladies suffer in the old days, now everything is sort of different they accomplish women for the things they do and treat us better than how women were treated back in the days , Thomas Jefferson wants things to be different and probably doesnt want people to do the same mistakes they did in time of history.

56,56,506A69171959,"Do you have a goal in your life? How can you accomplish to your goal? I think everyone can get a goal, but many people ask, ""how can I get a goal?"" Because they cannot wait until the finish goal line, also they cannot concentrate on their goal. We cannot see the finish line,that is why people always give up in fort of the finish line you are always doing something, then you can do accomplish more. This is three reasons you can do accomplish more if you are always doing something. First is when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Concentrate power is amazing, Every history of the scientists were concentrate one thing and always do something. For example, have you seen the Newtons notes? He always thought and concentrated to gravity and earth. He took notes every seconds and minutes, he never stopped take notes. Today, we learning his notes everyday like Newtons first law, second law, and third law. If you think about it and concentrate one thing, you can closer to your goal. Second, If you keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. For example, David in the Bible, he practiced throw the stone everyday. He never forgot to practice throw the stone, and one day he met an enemy. Everyone thought David will die because David was so small and young, but the enemy was really big and strong. Do you know the end of story? David won the battle because of the stone, he attacked enemys head. what is the main idea of this story? Throw the stone is really small and tiny thing, but he attacked enemy and saved the nation. If you keep going on any small thing and tiny thing, you can make it and you can make more biggest thing, you could not imagine thing. Third, you keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. Keep trying and keep dreaming are really important. If you dont have dream in your life, you can never get that. For example, Aristotle was experiment everyday. Also the result was different everyday, but he keep trying figure out the result. If you gave up that time and stopped challenge, then maybe we dont know who is the Aristotle. Many scientists also said this, keep dreaming is better than not dreaming. Keep dreaming and get more closer to your goal in your dream, get a hope and keep challenge. Finally, when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Becuase the concentrate power is amazing. Do not give up and keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. You keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. If you want to something to do and something to accomplish, you have to know what is my goal and what should I do for my goal.

Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life. I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they cant go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way. People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you dont know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just dont take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you dont know or not good at anything, why you dont try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up. in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier dont make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally dont give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

58,58,2E5A3E5FD179,"I disagree, to have one and a half hour added to our school hours. It would cause stress and angry, to students and teachers. Teachers would have to stay longer at school to grade papers. Students would get hugry and sleepy and have less tie to play. If the school board plans to add a hour and a half hour to school, then students would try to stay home. Students would try to miss the bus and try to get sick if theirs a test or anything that seems underwhelming. Students would get low grades if theirs a lot of homework and less time to do it, they would just not try to do it. Teachers would get more paper work from students and try to make plans for the students for them to learn a easy way, so it wont make extra work for all of them. Students would have less time to practice from sports or other actives if theirs more homework and if they are failing a classes and get kick of the team if they play a sport. Students would be starving more if they dont eat breakfast, because they dont have time. Students go to school at different times so they wake up different times as well, and dont get time to eat or make something later. Students would bring food to school and would leave trash, and its extra work for other people who have to clean it. And when school over they would have less time to have something fun to do. Students would sleep and not do home work and not do their chores or stay up to do homework or study and play games. They would have less time to eat and not have the energy to wake up and get ready for school and to stay awake at school. Teachers would stay longer at school, to do the extra work, and miss important things that they have to attend. They should get paid more to stay longer and deal with kids. Teachers would get stress and try to deal with the kids that cause trouble and distractions in the classroom. They would get more strict and angry.

59,59,E54E238C6DDB,"I would think that some students would stay home so they can catch up on things they need but some stay so they can get the help they really need. For example if a parent sees his child struggling they could ask their child and be like do you need help or what do you want us to do to help you. Im pretty sure that some students are gonna take this opportunity, and take online classes or get the help they need from a teacher or someone they know who can help them. The real reason that I think they will do it is because they would want to graduate from school so they can get the diploma and be happy that they did it with the help of a parent. Yes, I do believe that students would benefit with taking classes at home or by online classes with a video conferencing. Students should be grateful that some schools are giving them the opportunity to take some classes at home or even with a teacher they can video chat with and they can help them too. If it wasnt for the school who was giving us the privilege do take this opportunity for the help then we wouldnt be passing anything or getting the help we need. For example, if a student goes to the school and tells them hey im having trouble getting this subject i know for sure the teacher are gonna give them a choice to pick if they want help or take online classes at home with like a teacher whos helping them. Another reason kids ask for help is because they probably ask at home and sometimess parents dont have the time to help them cause they are tired from work or they just tell them to ask someone else and then they dont get the help they need. For some students its easy for them but for some it isnt easy so some students can help each other so they can understand it. For other reasons its better for kids to try on there own first and then if they still dont get it then they ask for the help or ask the teacher for help at the same time. In conclusion i think its a good idea that the school can give the benefit for students to take online classes so they can get the help they need.

Imagine this, a world without people imagining things. if people dont use their imagination then half of the stuff we have now would be not here. I agree that imagination is important than knowledge, because you can imagine how your future going to be, and imagine how you can change the world. Imagination is important because without it, how did people make the things we have now, because they use there imagination. If you imagine it hard enough it might come true. Scientist are making medicine to cure the sick, why do they do that? Because they imagined that if there was no medicine then half of they human population would die, so they make medicine. If there were no police then our world would be full of criminals and destruction so they imagined to make a police station and people became cops. You can also help out the world. If you just imagine how you are going to do that and imagine how your future is going to be if you do that. I know some of us imagine to grow up and marry a famous person, sadly imagination dont work like that, but there are many beautiful girls and boys (or puppies, if your going to be single all your life) out there. And I know you prefer someone like Emma Watson or someone else, but like I said imagination dont work like that.

For the future am planing on pursuing the Auto tech field. In the past I worked at a Mc Donalds. At the moment am a high school student who is involved in the Auto tech classes, Im also a member of the engine building team. When I first came to this the U.S I started working with my brother on landscaping, under a lot of pressure. When I first started working at Mc Donalds I didnt know a lot about how to treat costumers. With in the time I experience multiple occasions in which I had to be patient and listen to the costumers. I had to learn how to work with different people and different personalities. Thanks to the opportunity Mc Donalds gave to work there I gain a lot of knowledge on treating costumers. Now I can say that am confident and willing to work with others and help costumers. At the moment Im involved in the auto tech classes and am a member of the engine building team which take place after school. Being in this classes has help me learn and gain experience on cars. This classes have taught me how to be organized and clean with the tools. In the engine team I learn how to be faster on everything and also being careful. Graduate being a Auto technician is my goal. When I first came to the United States I needed to work, thats when I started working in landscaping with one of my older brothers. working in landscaping is hard, you have to deal with heavy equipment sometimes. I remember my brother use to put a lot of pressure on me sometimes, because he needed the job to be done in one day. There I learn how to control myself during peer pressure. Thanks to my brother now I know how to use power equipment and delicate tools. With all this being said I will like to be selected to go visit your dealership and learn more about it. I see many oportunities for me at your dealership. I will like to have an Idea of what are the requirements to pursue the auto tech field. With all my experience Im positive and confident that I can achieve my goal of being a technician one day. I will also like to thank you for taking your time to read this letter.

63,63,FA2DE7E82907,"Its has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. Keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. True self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success. Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam. Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for. Student learn for their mistakes its much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that dont show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because its better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn. while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and its better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesnt mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem.",5,5,5,6,5,7,3773,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
64,64,ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes. First of all I dont think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers dont even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time. Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they wont be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldnt get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students wont focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours.

65,65,77D5466305CB,"Have you ever wonder what would happen if you know more about something you like, something you want to experience, how people can do many things, how they learn how to do a lot of things. Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person. Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do. My oldest sister know how to make cakes, she thought that was all she can do, but one time I dare her to do a recipe that is famous in my country, ""pupusas"" she didnt know how to make it, but she try, she fail and what she cook was really bad, but she started to practice and try until she reach it. Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know. People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake. When I came here I thought I wouldnt learn english and that I wouldnt have friends, but then I thought ""If I dont start practicing or trying to learn I wont be able to communicate with others"" so I start trying and know I speak a little bit more and understand a little bit more. Then I thought ""I need to speak with other so I can practice more"" but I was so scared that people wouldnt understand me but I had to try, and then I start trying to talk with others, now I am not afraid of talk with others enymore, my english is growing and my experiences too. I would be stuck if I hadnt try. My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didnt know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesnt know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doenst mean thats all she can do. Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didnt know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesnt mean you cant do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doenst mean it didnt work, it mean something went bad and you dont need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do. Experiences make people better, growing makes people better, trying makes people better, all person are capable of doing what they want.

67,67,CB327222A71B,"I agree with the Author Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a word that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", because the most important in this world is to be yourself. To be yourself is to make you unique and different for the others. Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let others people tell you to be different. The first is to be yourself. Some people things if you dont be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. In my case when I came in the United States, I dont like to be myself because I was a little scared the kind of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people."" In that moment I changed my life and the way I look people. The second things is to achieve goals by yourself is motivate you to continue do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself dont only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you think, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth. The third things what is important is dont let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they dont like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I dont remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Dont let any person to over shine the light you had."" In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself dont matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let other people tell you to be different.

69,69,E7DB2DC8B151,"I think curfews do keep teenagers out of trouble and it helps them sleep on time because after those hours a lot of law breaker are on the streets and something bad could be happening outside or on the streets like gang fights , shootings , robbers , durg dealers, drunk drivers and many more. The first reason is shootings mostly happens at night late after 10 p. m and it would be better to stay inside in those hours than to go outside and for example a teenager is walking home from a friends house late in the midnight and gets in a fight with gang member and gets shot. while it would have been better with the curfew in place. Curfews help teenagers go to sleep on time well like on the weekdays when they got school the next day and sleep on time and wake up on time and be refreshed for a test or something for example a teenager has school the next day and since he does not have a curfew he sleeps late and he misses the bus and forgets he has a test that day. And another example a teenager has a game he does not sleep early and he wakes up tried and is not able to play the game as well as he could. Curfews could also help teenagers mange their time appropritely and how they spend the day for example a teenagers has a project or a home work the curfew time will help know what he/she must do first before he/she have some free time and goes to sleep.

70,70,2E98035B8362,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, ""A problem is a chance for you to do your best. "" I agree, because when a problem is present you have a chance to learn a lesson, new things and methods to solve it. When a problem is present you have an opportunity to learn a lesson and keep trying to solve the problem until you find the answer to it. When you have a problem you can also learn new things like what is it that is making the problem, what it is affecting, and whom is it affecting. When you have a certain problem you can also learn other methods to solve it like how and who made the problem, how can you solve the problem, and what plan you can use to solve it. For example you are facing a bigger problem that you have ever faced before and when you finale solve it you have learned a new lesson, method, and two or more new thing about how you can,may or will solve your future problems even if they are tougher than the ones you ever faced before because the bigger you get, the bigger your problems become. For another example, imagine yourself as a detective in a homicide case, you are facing the problem of learning new evidence and using new methods, while using the lessons and new thing you have learned while were investigating the crime scene. You have to use all of those tactics to find the corporate, because all you need is to use the lessons you have learned while you are learning a new one, learning two or more new things, and having a method to capture the corporate (criminal).

71,71,5F67A5D3DBB0,"I think students, parents, and including me wouldnt like the idea of adding a hour and half of a hour each day of the school thats why I disagree with the idea of extending the day of school because students have other things to do like pick up little brothers or sisters and take of them, help mom and dad with the house, do another types of activities because if students are only thinking about school all the time we can stress out a lot and theres no rule that says that students cant have fun also we are in school for about 7 or 8 hours so i think thats enough. First of all some of the students have little brothers and sisters and the parents work and they dont have the chance to pick up they kids because they get out of the work late, so the orders sibling haves to take care of they little brothers and sisters also little kids from elementary schools cant get out of the bus without someone picking them up, so the older siblings have to pick them up or else the little kids are going back to school and they get scared because they are the only one who are in the school and they are little so they dont know whats going on so that is one reason why we cant be in school more hours not even half of a hour. Secondly students have to help they parents with the house how i said parents came from work late and they dont have time for nothing so students have to help them by cleaning the house, cook for they sibling and parents , they have to wash the dishes, wash they clothes, clean the rooms, some of the students have dogs and they have to go with them for a walk or take them to the doctor so when parents get home they can lay down and chill because they work really hard and all the students can do is helping doing the cleaning that is the second reason why we cant be at school more than we supposed to be. Finally some students have another type of activities after school like dancing, soccer practice and soccer games, basketball practice and basketball games, step teams, community service, etc also that helps a lot to get your mind out of thinking about homeworks, tests, classwork, so you dont stress out a lot because being honest sometime students have a lot of homework and test to do in each class and after school is the only time where you can get your mind out of school and also we are having fun for a little time because some parents are kind off strict and they dont let they kids to be outside after 8:30. In conclusion we cant be in school more than 8 hours because all the students have more activities to do and have fun for a little time and we have responsibilities at home helping parents cleaning and taking care and picking up little siblings and we can stress out a lot if we spend more than 8 hours in school because that means more work to do and we would be only student and we would be tired because also we are not going to have time to chill and i know that no one is going to be happy about it because teachers have they children as well parents need the help of they kids and students need they own time so these are my reasons of why I disaree of adding a hour and half of a hour.

72,72,BFCE7D755436,"Do you think should student to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes ? A lot of young people has cell phones that can use for many ways. The young people use their cell phones for text with their family or do their homework, but Todays many kids are going away from people. However, they use the cell phone in bad ways in classroom, so, I believe students should not use the cell phones in class because they could cheat in their exams and get easy score. The first reason , when the teacher says, ""get out the phone, we are going to start study in our phone"". The students does not care when the teacher is giving the instructions of the topic. A lot of students are going to playing games or listening music and when the teacher ask question about of the topic they would say, ""i do not know and every body starts to laugh because they were not paying attention in the classroom and their grades is going down. The second reason,Todays in the world student only put their face in the cell phones. A lot of student use the cell phone for their social media in classes, therefore, Student are not paying attention in class when the teacher is explaining the topic. However, student when the cell phone is allowed to use, they will have more focus in their social media than classes. For example, A lot of student have the famous ""snapchat"" that it is film videos for ten seconds and share in your story for people see them, Student with their cell phones are going to put any video in their story to showing the teacher talking or everybody laughing. Another reason and is the most important, Student cheat in exams with their cell phones because the teacher says, ""you can use your cell phones in this test"". however, students do not study for any home work or test. they can get a easy score. For example, they know can use the cell phones in test, but this time the teacher says, ""you cannot use the cell phones in this test."" The student are going to get bad scores because they thought that can use the cell phone to get a great score. however, a lot student do not study for any test when they can use the cell phone. However, The propose of the teacher is that student earn easy information and good scores. The allowed to use the phone has a good way that students can search homework or read a book. Sometimes the teacher gives homework to do at home and you will use your cell phone for solve the homework. For example, students are learning other language and do not know some word in the information gave the teacher, they can use the translate to know the word. In conclusion, Students should not allowed to use the cell phones in classrom because they are not going to learn anything at the final of year. Allowed to use the cell phone is a disadvantage for students in the futures in their jobs because they were always in their cell phone playing or social media.",7,7,6,6,5,5,2587,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
73,73,477B00F899E2,"Student-designed Projects Encourage Learning Summers can be boring for students, especially when homework is assigned. Students have creative minds and a variety of interests which can be specialized to a topic of interest; however, schools tend to assign a generic assignment to all students despite their differences. Summer projects are intended to enable students to continue learning and exploring the world through a lense of their interest. Therefore, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to spark, their creativity to grow, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Firstly, student-designed summer projects will allow for every student to specify the project on his or her interests. Every child is different and shows admiration towards different subjects in school. If teachers design the summer project, the students will lack incentive to explore an area of interest as that has already been done for them. Additionally, teachers will attempt to design the summer project in a way that it applies to all students; however, not all students think alike. For example, most middle schools conduct science fairs that allow kids to explore an area of science that particularly interests them. This allows for children to research heavily into a subject and even enjoy doing so. This not only sparks an interest for science, but it also allows students to show off their abilities and specialize in their talents. This science fair analogy can be applied to summer projects because children will develop their admiration towards an educational topic and will enjoy the learning process. This creates a positive incentive for learning despite it being summer. Secondly, if students are enabled to design their own summer projects, creativity will occur and develop. When teachers design projects, students are incentified to simply follow instructions and do as they are told. This results in surface level researching and a lack of interest in actually learning and retaining knowledge. This is understandable as most students do not enjoy a generic assignment that does not apply specifically to their interests. However, if students were given the opportunity to design their own project, they could research a subject that sparks their interest and creativity. This will lead to a deeper understanding of the topic and will result in a better quality of summer projects completed over all. For example, refering back to the science fair analogy, most students will become creative and design their own experiments if they are given the opportunity to do so. Most students enjoy being given the freedom and trust to become creative and show off their interests. Lastly, when students return to school after summer break, they will see a variety of interesting summer projects completed by their classmates. The student-designed projects allow for a large variety of topics to be explored, and will benefit the students intensely. If all students, for example, have the same assignment, they would be less interested in their classmates projects as they would all be generically similar. However, if the students have the opportunity to design and conduct their own research into their favorite topic, then the students can share each others interesting new insights with each other and spread their knowledge. This increases students admiration for learning and will inentify them to study something interesting for their classmates. In conclusion, allowing students to design their own summer projects allows for their interests to be explored, their creativity to flourish, and their areas of knowledge to expand. Schools tend to fail to recognise that each student is different, and that he or she requires different learning styles in order to be successfull in learning. It is vital that students are given the opportunity to become creative and explore an interest that is dear to them. If this is not prioritized, schools will continue to foster the idea of simply following instructions.",9,9,10,10,10,10,938,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
74,74,2003BF2E6DD0,"What is knowledge with little to no imagination? If you had a mind filled of knowledge but with barely any imagination then that would be the same as eating an Oreo with a dusting of cream in the middle. Just constant knowledge is boring, but adding imagination is like adding sprinkles on to a boring vanilla cake. Quantum physicist, Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Einstein is indeed correct because there are many ways imagination is more important than knowledge. One reason why imagination is greater than knowledge is that of the ability to imagine the unthinkable. For example, how do you think Albert Einstein learned and explored the unknown of quantum physics? He used his mind to imagine the unthinkable. How you think Elon Musk came up with the idea to start a colony on Mars? He imagined in it all in his head. How do you think Steve Jobs invented the iPhone? He used imagination to gain that knowledge. Imagination is what fuels the mind to create knowledge. Its all in the head, thats where it all starts from. Another reason why imagination is important is because of the benefits of using your imagination often. For example, using your imagination often will have you obtain a more creative and detailed mindset overall. You can also do many cool things using your imagination such as lucid dreaming, invent new ideas, or even train your mind to see the world in a different way. You should always use your imagination often to strengthen it. You should also try lucid dreaming to come up with brand new or more innovative idea while using your already known knowledge. Finally, the last reason why imagination is more important than knowledge is that it can change you mentally and physically. How imagination can change you mentally as a person is by making you a better person or be a more fun person overall. How imagination can change you physically as a person is by motivating you to be a better by work outing and or going on jogs pretty often. As a result, using your imagination can change you in many ways as described above, unlike knowledge. In conclusion, I agree with Einstein and his idea about how imagination is more important than knowledge. Using your imagination is benefiting, motivating, changing all in different ways. No matter who you are, you will be changed by the different ways imagination can affect you and on your already known knowledge. Imagination is alot more important than you think it is.",9,8,8,8,9,8,422,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
75,75,BAD99FB704BB,"Is honesty always the best policy? An old proverb says honesty is the best policy. sometimes, however, honesty might get really bad effects. honesty is a good characteristic , if the the situation is very serious or you and yours friends did something really bad , you need to be honest and speak the true, but sometimes honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someones feelings or you and people around you might get in little troubles. Honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someones feelings. For example ,one of Generic_Names friends tells her something and ask Generic_Name to keep it a secret, the next day someone is trying to persuade her to say her friends secret out loud and she just reply by saying, "" what secret are you talking about? , my friend didnt tell me a secret or something like that."" she did the right thing by laying because if she would not lied about it , the friend that asked her to keep the secret would feel upset and nobody else is going to trust Generic_Name. Another example is that if your friend ask you if she looks good in a certain outfit , however, that is not your style and you dont like it at all , the best thing to do is to say that you like the outfit, if you tell her this , you will not hurt your friends feelings. One more reason of why honesty is not always the best policy is that you or people around you might get in trouble. For example , If you and your sister ate something that your mom left in the fridge while saying "" I am going to work and when I come back , I will eat this."" when your mom arrives home, you tell her that you and your sister didnt heard when she say that she will eat it later on. This way , you and your sister will not get in trouble , however , you know that it was just a white lie and that if you do something serious the next time , you need to be honest and tell her the true. In conclusion , honesty is not always the best policy because you might hurt someones feelings or you and people around you might get in trouble, however, there are many situations in where you need to be honest and speak the true.

76,76,81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like theyve had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path. When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career. Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they werent good enough didnt just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. Theyve taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, theyve given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts. However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be.

77,77,E4051C85D12E,"If we think about the words that the British Prime Minister Wiston Churchill sait "" succes consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" There is a lot of truth is this words well that is what I believe. So how important is the role that failure plays in the process to reach success and dont loss enthusiasm in the proccess? In my opinion it is very important because it make us gain experience, improve our skills, and it make you feel comfortable and happy at the end. Lest think about how you feel when your staring in the proccess to reach a new goal that you propose to youself it could be hard at the begin, because is your first time in that enviroment and maybe you have none experience there, and that could make you to fail some times and could be desesperate to you. you or people migth say, "" this is not for me,"" because you already fail a few time and you think but is just the beginc how will be the future. That could make you loss enthusiasm, but if you think what happend when you keep going with all this fails youre gaining a lot of experience during that proccess. For example, when I star to study at Generic_School it was a big change for me staring with the lenguage, because I came from a coutry of Spanish speakers and here the official lenguage is English, so I remember that in the begin my English was really poor, and I just knwe a few words in English like good morning or the name of some schools supplies, but everytime I did something wrong I learnd something new from that mistake wich make me gain experience in the proccess of my English learning. Even if sometimes is embarasing to say or spell worng a word infront of people you will be learning to do it rigth with the time. Therefore we should see the fails as a good oportunitie to gain more experience. Most of the time you will notice some changes in yourself while youre reaching some goal, Im talking about the change on your own skills. That could be maybe improve some skills that you already had before or in the best of the cases developing a new one. Using the last example that I used, when I star to learn English I remember that my speaking was the most hard part for me, because is hard to think a word first in Spanish and then traslate that word in to English and also spell that word correct just on your mind. Sometimes I started a sentence but then I couldnt finish it. That was so embarrassing for me, but with the time that problem has been decreased not all, but now is not like the begin. Sometimes that happend to me again when Im doing presentation or when Im imfront of nwe people that i have never met. But I feel that the practice has been helping me to decrease that problem and now is easier for me to speak with some body in English at school or in my job . Even if you feel bad or embarrassing to fail with the time that will help. You can be improving skills or even descoviring new ones while you fail that is part of the whole proccess of reach success. Maybe for some people the fact of fail is the worst thing that can happend to them in the proccess to reach success some of them could say,"" You have to do perfect if you want to reach your goals,"" but I think that we can not do perfection without failure. Failure is a big and lest say importnat part of reach success. Have you ever heard the words , "" No pain, No gain,"" I like that words, because reminds me how good feels when you reach a goal in wich you speend a lot of time or maybe hard work. For example, when you have a big test at school and you have been studing for that test all nigths for a week or even more and the day of the test you know all the anwers for that test and you got an A or A+ as a grade that feels so good and comfortable to you. Just because of your hard work you are getting all this good grades that you gain by yourself. That is one of the best sensations that you can ever feel or experiment. Using my example agin I can say that all the result of my hard work that I have done helping me to get good gains in my English developing . Not matter howmany times you fail the last feeling is best in the world. Because is the result of all your hard work. Sometimes I remember how hard was for me to star school in a differnt country, but when I see that Im about to garduate and get my High School diploma it reminds me all the hard work that I have done during this almost 2 years that I have studing here in Generic_School. It could sound bad when you hear the word failure or fail when your trying to reach a goal, but if you think we should see all the forms that this words have. Success is not all about fail there is more. We have to go deeper into that words. As I said fail is a big and important part in the way to reach a goal. Success is a big proccess with branches and one of this branches is the failure. But failure give us more than we think. it give us experience that could prepare us for future problems or future goals, it also prepare or improve your skill and even if you dont have one you could descover one that you didnt notice, and finally, but no less important the comfortable feeling that give you at the end is incredible because remind you all the hard work that you have done. So I think if you don t want to lloss enthusiasm during the proccess of reach success you shouldn""t see the word failure as it is you should go deeper in to try to understand the important role that it plays in the pursuit of success. I just mencion three reasons here but there could be more than three just dont think that just because you fail is the end of the world instead see how failure could help you to reach that important goal your or success. I hope all the time that Ive fail in my English speaking will help me to in the future became in a perfect bilingual speaker having my home lenguahge Spanish and my new home lenguage English.

But some time people they dont like to do school work for the reason they think there are not smart. In my position do work its some i like to do every day because thats how i learn more stuff.

82,82,A28940CA5863,"Do you think it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? Personally, I would rather go to my house, and eat spaghetti because people need to realize of what career they would want to choose if they would want to succeed in the future. Few of my friends want to become a doctor, and some of my other friends would want to become a mechanic. Careers are like longtime thinking, for people would want to change their minds, and choose another career that is more suitable for them to learn in college. The reason why I choose this topic, for people need time, impression, and support for their careers. People always need time to think of what career that they would want to choose, so they can enjoy their careers, and have better reputation in their work. Some teachers think it is a better idea to think of a career in high school, yet some students disagree with the teachers. Students in high school need to understand that if they dont like the career that they choose, they are more likely to fail than succeeding than others in their careers. Bunch of students agree that having to think about career in high school is a good thing; however, a lot of students disagree that we should have more time to think about careers at a older age. These are the reasons why I think young people should have more time to think of what career that they would want to have, so they can gain more confidence in the future. Impression is also important, for it helps people gain morale if they would want to think of a career. Some students think having impression wont help you, yet some students do agree that having impression would help pressure them to find a career. Generic_Name went to college with impression, so she had the confidence of choosing what career that she would like to choose at a older age. Impression isnt for everybody, nor it is for some students who need of help finding a career in high school or college. Impression would help some students in high school, but some teachers do think it would also help them in college. Personally, I would need impression if I would wanna go to college. Support is also good too, for people who arent confident of choosing what career they want to learn about, so they would ask their friends, or even family members for help and support. Support is a main key to success; however, few of my friends disagree with me. The reason why they dont believe in support, for they found careers easier without receiving help in college, or even in high school. People also need to support young kids that having a career is a longtime changing, so they would have to think about it in college, and not in high school. Generic_Name wanted to become a doctor, yet she didnt do well, so she gotten support to look for another career in college. The reason why I like support, for I wouldnt want to brainstorm careers by myself. The thing about young people is that thinking about careers in high school should have more time to think, for it is always important of what career they would want to choose. I do agree that some students should brainstorm about their careers in high school; however, I am not very sure if they would like to learn a lot about whatever career they have committed to. Even people do want to commit to a career at a young age they would still need to know what to do to learn in college. Thinking about a career isnt easy, yet some students dont take it seriously of what career that they are committed to. These are all the reasons why I think we should have time, impression, and support. We should commit to a career at a older age, not at a younger age.",7,6,6,7,6,7,2176,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
83,83,9B42B1750AD8,I dont think the principal should make the students clean up litter or do community service because they might have other thinks to do with their familys. Elementary students can probably do it because they might not have anything to do because they still in elementary and they probably have time to pick up litter or maybe jr high students can help too if there not to busy maybe some of the students that dont play any sports can probably help too. In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service. People like me can probably do it on weekends just to help others because im always busy during the week.

Next, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because we can go far with that, for example: In my future I can get my goals and get everything in my life, that is, a car, a big house, and things like that. Then, I agree with the positive attitude, that is something important to do and to have a better life. Also, my idea is, if we are positive in our life, we can get a lot of success with our goals. I can follow these list to see what I can do to a positive attitude. Do something interesting Search something new Talk with a trust friend After that, some people disagree to a positive life because I think they dont have something in their life, like a good future. Something interesting, a prompt help us to do everything fast but is not good, because can happened something bad. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because thats something important we have to do, if dont do something good we dont have a better life, we stay in the same way, for instance, each day we have to know new things, for this reason a agree whit that. I believe to success in life because I can get a lot opportunities. In my opinion to have a positive life, we can relax, read books, listen to music, go out to walk or talk with some good person, these can help us to forget the problems or something bad in our life. Be positive is something can help you to do what you want in your life, and other people to be positive. Later on, my mom said, I have to be always positive and try any thing new, I think that is true because some times when I cant do something, I try do it like 3 times, after three times I can to everything to myself, so thats a good idea to try every thing what we cant do. A prompt is something what can we do fast and done quickly.

87,87,B9733BDA883E,"High school the place where we can all do anything we want and just a step before going to college, or at least this is what a lot of middle schoolers think. In high school we take so many classes that are required and those classes are supposed to open up doors and get us closer to our goals. But, classes like arts, music or drama will give us something that we cannot get from others classes. These classes are like a little break, just a whole class to forget about having to write an essay or doing some long math equations and, instead just have fun with friends and enjoy singing, painting and even acting. These classes teach the students how to socialize and communicate with others. High school is not as easy as some would think, students usually get really stressed because they have to pass their classes, their Sols and start getting prepare for college all at the same time. There is where classes like this can give a little opening to reduce some of that stress. Usually the environment in this classes is always joyful and fun, it is a place where students can learn through socializing and having fun. Who knows may be students would never think they like music but after some months taking music they would find out they love it and decide to become a musician and that can also happens with art and even drama. Classes like this not only give a little time off all the stress and pressure from high classes but also can give lessons to students that they would never even imagined they would learn. Now, think about a extremely coy student who has never had the confidence to speak up in class not even to ask a question their math class, we know we all have asked something in math is just a class that at least a question per unit seems mandatory. However, how can that same student later on give a speech or have the valor to push himself up in a big company if he never has learned how to properly communicate. Even if he has huge talent and the brain of a genius he will never be successful. In life being able to express ourselves is something required, something that we have to do if we want to move keep moving up our hill path. Nothing will be easy but communication is a social skill we all have to learn. Many will not agree on this and can will make strong arguments on how this classes are a waste of time. That after all we do not get anything from this classes and students just see these classes as a place to hang around with friends and procrastinating for 90 minutes. well, what about those students that do not have friends, students that always sit back in a corner and the teacher has never get him to say something. The students no one has ever heard from, or sometimes even noticed they are there. Shouldnt school concern about them, shouldnt school be the place where they can grow and open up their winds to start flying on their sky of opportunities. ""Tu voz habre puertas"" It is something i heard from a commercial once i was watching TV with my mom, it means ""Your voice opens up doors"" but those doors will never open if we open our mouths to ask questions that will give us answers those answers will impulse us further in life.

Another reason why i agree is that you dont have to lie even more to cover what you already lied about. And it its hard to catch up with Ur lying it can also get confusing and you can get caught lying to there face. The last thing is if you get caught lying it can cause more problems with the person and can lead to more issues. It can also help the other person to trust you. If the person trust you you dont have to lie to them so it wont hurt there feeling. Also you can lose someone trust or lose the realashinship you have with them. It can also hurt a lot of other people that u care about. lying can cause you to look bad in front of people. And id it hurts there feeling you can solve them because you told the truth.

89,89,7F21F77E9AA3,"Big Responsibility Young Age In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? Well figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young. Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor. You cant know what you want to do in your life even if you havent live by your self. I dont think its a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if its your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I dont think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present. Its hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you dont know what career you want to take its fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didnt have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time. In conclusion if a student its a really young age let them think what they want not only because its at young age its also because they going to pick something that its for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they havent discovered what life is like.

91,91,E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal. Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isnt strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isnt strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isnt strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone. Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here. Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person. While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that dont really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people dont find examples of influential that arent interesting or appealing to them at all because its doesnt suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasnt really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasnt influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really cant influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something.

The next thing I want to add is young people have to be shown and have experiences the a 10:pm weekend curfew is a descent amount of time to get them well trained other places like military, Juvenile, and like closing of businesses. Teenagers have a hard time staying in one place of a very long time with no free time a midnight curfew for teenagers is good for them so they can reflect and learn for their mistakes. Some teenagers are committing crimes and getting away with it but this program well benefit them but in a matter time they will become good teenagers and obey the law. However, they will carry the behavior through their work place and public areas with good attitude and good behavior and it will never interfere of young persons live for example,lets say a job interview and the person who wants to hire you and he or she will see your characteristics and how many times you have broke the law and getting into trouble the person wont hire you cant get a job when you have a bad record of committing crimes and facing the law so, curfews are a good suggesting with young people that you cant say no to. However, another example is vandalizing when you harm someones property without permission as an example like graffiti, braking car windows, and invading somebody elses property.

While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer. One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things. Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home. One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side. Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it.

When I found out that I could make the noise it was in 1st grade. I made the noise all the time, I could do it and no won could stop me except myself. The only reason I really never stopped was because i made my friends laugh and i made jokes. The first example was I making what does the fox say and I made my weird noises. The second example was I randomly out of nowhere I slowly looked at my friends and stared right at them and i quickly made a lobster position and chased them well making the noise. I make a lot of noises at school but at home its even worse. When am at home thats when I strike with the noises. I really liked annoying my sisters all the time. But, they punched me because I was being annoying because I always made the noises. The first reason they would punch me was because I sat right next to them and started making the noise, and less the two seconds she punched me really hard on the shoulder. The second reason was when I went in my sister room and started pocking her when i was making the weird noises and she got so mad she punched me on my chest that really hurt. But, now I really dont make the noises anymore i got tired of it myself. But, I do it on accident sometimes when im playing games. I found out I had a talent and that was making high pitch noises And I used a lot. I made my friends laugh hard and made my sisters hate me a lot but i had fun with it. I made jokes one is what does the fox say and i made my high pitch sounds. the other was being punched by my sisters on the shoulder and the chest "" man the chest one really hurt"".

100,100,00B21F9B726F,"Do you think its a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? In some societies, students are expected to identity a career by the time they enter high school. Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you wont have time to choose an career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes. As a students taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career and you will have background knowledge about that career. for an example Im taking auto technology in highschol becuase I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. after high school I will be going to a community college so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and thats Im going to succeed in life. Another reason why its a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is becuase it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. by doing this they will accomplish their goals. others may say that its not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age becuase they think its waste of time however, its not waste of their time, becuase once your getting older you wont have time to choose an career that will last. In conclusion, I think its a good a idea for students to commit to a career at a young age becuase you will have some background knowledge to that specific career, you will be one step ahead, and once you get older you wont have time to choose a career.

One day I imagined that I would play travel soccer for a really good team in Florida when I imagined that I put my mind into it and I made my imagination become reality. For example when you were a kid you used to imagine that you were flying through the air or in space fighting aliens on Mars, imagination can come a long way from just being a kid to inventing something that can change the world. I agree with Albert Einsteins statement I do believe his statement not only because he was one of the greatest scientist in the world but because this statement is so truthful. Knowledge is a huge part of our lives we need knowledge in everyday activities in school we gain our knowledge by going to class and learning more and more lessons everyday. Imagination is more important than knowledge, everyone can imagine things its not whether if I have more knowledge than you or if she has more knowledge than me there is no limit when it comes to imagination. Anyone can imagine something and make it happen its the effort you put into your imagination that makes knowledge superior to your imagination. Knowledge can only get you so far in life if you dont have a thought proccess but what you do have is knowldge how far is that going to get you whee you need to be? If we didnt have any imagination in our lives where would we be right now?

It will makes us not fell into depression, When we eat chunk food and we dont eat any healthier food it makes us get fat and when we cant stop eating it makes us go to the level that we get obese and when we get obese a lot of students fells into depression because they dont like that way they look after they weight increase. obesity is a big problem for our health, because it can take you to the level that you will not be able to walk.

106,106,113B1543C433,"If School programs offer Student to graduate early instead of waiting the four year to graduate. Graduating a year earlier would be a great thing for student to do because there are people who are trying to manage work and school but its difficult for some people because they cant do both, If they work and they come late after work and the next morning they wake up tired from work that they are tired to go to school and it makes it difficult to go to work and then go to school. A reason why I feel students should graduate early is because if they graduate early they can go to college, and if college allows them to choose their hours they can decide on what time they can go to college or the days. It could also depend on what you want to do career wise. If they allow that you can work and go to college and it would make it easier for you and you wont feel tired after college to go to work. For example,My mom graduated early and she was able to work and and go to college as well. Another reason is that if you go to high school and work its difficult because you have to worry about school and work, sometimes thats a problem because when you come late from work and in the morning when you have to go into school your tired and you dont wanna go to school and your tired and you cant concentrate in school but I feel like when your in college you can choose your time and date and it makes it easier for you. For Example, I have a friend who works and goes to school to and he tells me its difficult for him to manage school and work and sometimes hes even tired to go to school. Even when hes at school hes tired and cant do any of his work because hes tired and its hard for him to concentrate. The last reason is if people were to graduate a year earlier from high school. They can also go to college and depending on on what they want in their career, they could also graduate college early and start you career early For Example, My Uncle graduated High school earlier and he also graduated college which made it easier for him to start his own business and it really helped him out in life and hes really happy because he graduated early. If you choose to graduate and do classes in the summer you would feel accomplished and you would feel relief you wont have to be there for 4 years and only 3 years. If you finish early you can have time for work and college and also you get start your career early and you would feel happy with what you have accomplished.

Since It snows a lot in the winter we would be missing more days of school If winter break was longer. The school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get, which is 2 months. We shouldnt have a break in the fall if we just got back into school after the long summer break. We should not have a longer winter break. Since it snows a lot in the winter, we miss a lot of school days. Students would be missing lessons, quizes, and even tests because of the snow days we get. Students need to catch up on everything and finish lessons before the school year ends. If we get a longer winter break we would be getting out of school later on which means less summer vacation. Since the school year is 9 months, students should get a summer break that we usually get. Students deserve the 2 months of summer break because of all the hard work and studying they did in the school year. In the summer students also get the chance to visit family members, spend more time with their family, and even get ready for the next school year. Since we just got back into school, It is not necessary to have a one week break in the fall. We just had a 2 month summer break which gave the students the opportunity to be ready for the next school year and also gave them a chance to have a vacation. Since there is also a lot of holidays in the school year, a fall break would interfere with the day we get out of school. Which means we would probably have a little longer school year. If we did have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall, the school year would be pretty short and the students wouldnt like the short breaks. Even though the educators would like it and thinks that it is helpful for students, it would make the students feel stressed out since the school year would probably be shorter.

This will give students a mindset to not give up easily. When students see others achieve their goals it gives them hope to be able to do the same, which leads to students trying their best to turn in their assignments on time and give their full effort on topics theyre given. However, students having success allows them to be good role models for older and younger generations. Students prove others whats like to achieve their goals and have the emotional support they need to continue their dreams. Students set a good example on how others can accomplish their own goals.

Having a good attitude tours someone you just meet, can bring good actions like a great friendship or relationship, a reason for a person that wants to hang out with you is because that person thinks your great person and they would like to spend more time with you because you give them a good impression to them and they think your a great person.

Also other believe that praises for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. I agree with there opinion,I believe that there should be goals to reach and you must try your hardest to achieve. Theirs always the chance the chance of failing but that just means to keep pushing, to fix the mistakes. And when you finally achieve your goal it makes you feel so much better about yourself. Also that builds you up for harder task. Therefore some believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. which I believe in too,feeling better about yourself works more when you have earned something. Also it can be anything but as long you give it your all,and achieve what is meant to be achieve. Your self-esteem is going to be built up knowing that you achieve something. Next I dont believe in just praising someone no matter how good the job was works like that. Because you keep praising that they could do so much better on,its just going to make the feel like they already got the job done,when they can do so much better. Praise their work when they tired there hardest,so then they can keep trying there hardest to achieve goals no matter what. Thats how i believe that praising should be done and how to build self-esteem to make whoever try to best on anything, to not give just half but to give there all. Finally does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? Its come from earning achievement,so they know they give it everything they had to earn that achievement. praises work when you praise there best work so they can keep on trying there best on everything.

An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study others failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isnt wrong, theres still other success with out failure. First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you cant success to be the best soccer player if you dont practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, youll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure. Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, theres some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it. Another way people can success, is by watching others failure and success. When you watch others failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldnt have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You dont just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure. So Winston isnt wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making youll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time. So I dont agree with Churchills statement, because their is more then just failure to success. Theres so much way to success with having to fail.

One reason to stay busy doing something is that will help you to develop new things, and focus doing things that you like to do, and see your potential and be able to do anything you have in mind. Another reason is that doing something will help you to open your brain, and think positive, also have big ideas that will be very helpful for your life, if we want to be a successful person, never have to be idle.

In fact, we dont know what it will happen if we dont give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem. Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in theres no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient. To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away. ",6,4,5,5,4,5,2731,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
116,116,5BF7AAC78AB5,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that "" success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Just like saying ""if you want to know everything you got to not know anything first."" , ""if you want to be rich you got to be poor first."" , ""You got to learn how to walk before you run."" Every people that are smart, rich and well-know there are all born without any of that just like every single one of us, no one is perfect. We all have something that we are good at and something that we are bad at. The way to successful is not hard to get there. Do what you are good at. Make sure you are enjoin what you are doing. Just like this one man that I forgot his name said ""get a job that you are enjoin doing it, a job that you have fun doing it and you will jump out of the bed in morning."" You are who you are right now because of all the mistake you make in the pass. ""success consists of going from failure to failure."" you lean from your mistake. If you never do anything wrong that mean you never do anything at all. All the mistake you make you better because you lean from it. You can also lean form another people mistake too. Its one of the reason why most of thing in world got better. Soccer is the sport that I like. Im not that good at it but not that bad either. When I first start playing I dont know a lot about it so I keep playing unit I know a little bit more about it. Then I start playing with the pro player because I know that Im gonna make a lot of mistake and all those mistake gonna help lean how to play and how to get better and it does. I make a lot of mistake I still do but I like to take a hit sometime it make me stronger. you know what they say ""what doesnt kill you make you stronger."" so I keep trying and trying hope that I can make that to be my job. Mistake dose help you it may be a big one something or a small one but all the mistake help you. I was really bad at soccer once but now I petty good at it. All of this should explain why Churchill said that""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

117,117,B2123357B114,"People have said ""positive attitude is the key to success in life"". I competely agree with the statement because the person would have a positive mindset even going through hard time in their life. They wont be giving up on their self. I belive without being positve a person would be depressed or being negative about their self. I belive if you want to be successful in life you gotta belive in yourself. You gotta bring yourself up when feeling down. A negative attitude wont get you no where. I understand that sometime life problem can be difficult, but you gotta keep being positive. Dont let yourself get to a negstive stage beacuse you wont be anvoidable to accomplish your dream. In life being a negavtive person isnt a good solution if you to be success in life. A person with a negative mindset would have bed thought in their mind. For example"" you cant do this"" or "" just give up on life"" . you wont have enough confidence to accomlished your goal. If you are a negative person then you should get some help or go talk to someone help. So, you can become a better positive person. A positive attitude help you to be something in the future. Its give you happiness and make life easier. You wont be upset thinking "" did i do this right "" or "" am i good enough "". Also, with a psitive mindset you will want to keep trying unitl you make it. when you a positive person ; people would want to be around you. You will have the best confidence you need to rech your goal. Life isnt a wonderful place sometime but if you want to be successful in life have self-confidence, be a positive person,and at least try to bring yourself up when you have negative mindset. Also, without giving yourself hope you will get no where in your life. ",7,6,6,6,5,5,2398,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

119,119,2B62F285FD21,"Its a good idea to have year-round school because you will not be out of school long that will make you forget what was just learned and will always have help from teachers all the time. Being out of school for a long time can make students forget what was just learned and its true because many kids have reported that they forgot what they have learned in that year of school. Shorter breaks is the way to go because you will be able to retain the information that the teacher taught last week. This is another advantage that you will have because students will be fresh and will have more time to learn and study for upcoming test and would probably even make them a better student. Having a long break is desireable by all of the students but it can also be a negative thing, Thats why having year-round school can improve many things for an example it can improve your grades, better focus and understanding, and better opportunities in life. It will even make the school at one of the best schools to go because the percentage of passing scores, quality of learning, and the best teachers. This will not just improve and make students better at school but can also give them opportunities and chances in life. Education is the most valuable thing in the world without it this world would of not had influential leaders and inventors. This can open new doors in life and it can make anyones dream career come true not mattering their race or class. Having year- round school is the answers to many solutions. In my opinion we should make a difference and have year-round schools. We have to make our youth in America into one of the most successful and brightest because they are the future of this nation.

120,120,EFCC45260444,"Well on my opinion I think that the best accomplishment is when someone tell you to be your self, no need to act or being someone we are not, Its better when we can be our self on this world. When someone act something they are not, they are kinda lie about how they really are, When we chose to be something we are not, Its the worse decision that we can do. But I know that every person think different to what others think. some think that act someone they are no is something better for the world. I totally disagree. We need to stop thinking or worry what other people are going to say, we just need to worry about our self and for the people who accept how we are, with the people we can act how we really are and those people who dont judge are the best people in the world the best accomplishment a person can give is when they tell you that they accept you how you are and that we are unique, dont need to change to something we are not, that is the best accomplishment that someone can give to someone. I dont agree with what Emersons statement say because, we dont need to change to someone else. We cant let the world change how we are. I dont think the greastes accomplishment is to be in this world constantly trying to make us something else. The greastes accomplishment is that we show how we really are we all have something unique we need to be ourself in order to make the world better. Being our self with someone its kinda the best thing someone can experiment, being our self with a person is the greastes thing in the world, now and days most all the people cant be them self around other people some of them laugh at the people who act exactly how they are, some of them dont really care or pay attention to what others are doing, and I think thats how it should be. now and days we see a lot of things, people that are gay, transgender, people that are bisexual, homosexual, now we see all that for almost all the people in the world that is something normal but most of them is not. but they just acting how they really are but sometimes it can just be confusing. Something that happened when I was 16 years old is that I had a friend that always was lying of how she really was, she used to said that she had a lot of money which wasnt true, she did have like the normal she was okay with what her parent had, she said that she was rich and all that, and because of that she make a lot of friends even that ones that were my friends stopped taking to me because i wasnt how they wanted me to be, they would tell me to go party with them, to drink, smoke and all that, my answer to all the was always no, so they stopped asking me, later on they find out that the new girl didnt have that much money as she said she had, the people who I thought that were my friends told me all that and the realize that acting something we are not is not always good being someone we are not, or telling people that we have something when is not true. We all have to be honest with each other. Thats why I always tell people be yourself no matter how hard it get, the best thing we can do its to be our self, people need to start accepting others how they really are, Dont need to be two faces, that is how we saying now in days. Now in days most of people would wear say whatever they want, most of the people dont care anymore they just focus on what they are doing no in what the others are doing.

121,121,2C4DE9FD3734,"Albert Einstein once said imagination is more important than knowledge. I have three reasons why I support his statement. My fist reason is if man havent imagined light would Thomas Edison create the light bulb? Second, is because imagination gives hope. Hope for one day to cure cancer, hope to stop world hunger, hope to have world peace. Phones,laptops, microwaves,how do you think we got their? Its because people imagined things other people thought wasnt possible. Because they didnt have the knowledge about it. Lets take the light bulb for example. People in those days used candles,and believe me as a kid whose been in the country side, its not the same. Thomas Edison imagined if he can create light, and he did it. Now his work led to lots of good every day things. Like tv, microwave, electronic toothbrush, laptops and so on. I had a friend,and her dad was sick. He had cancer and they couldnt afford the medicine. Her mom was a house wife,so she didnt have a job. If it was me in that scenario I would have gave up and accepted my dads fate. Unlike me my friend started working at McDonald. Getting paid 15 dollars an hour. She worked 4 hours on the week days and 6 hours on weekends. She made enough money to pay for her dads medicine and buy food for the house. Even tho she had to work, her grades where better than mine,and every time she felt down she starts imagining what she would do with her dad after after he gets better,and that gave her hope. Hope to work even harder. 2 month later it was time for her dads surgery,but she didnt have enough money for the surgery. Thats when the entire neighborhood decided to help her. After that her dad got his surgery and got better. Now she is in high school, working hard for for a scholarship. In conclusion,imagination is what makes us move forward.

122,122,F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school. I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school. Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school. In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours.",7,7,6,7,6,6,3642,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

125,125,9BF2607D4878,"The statement is ""the first impression is almost impossible to change"" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. We are doing it unconsciously. The first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. Sometimes its the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time its wrong. Moreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. If the person do not smile and seems to be rude but in reality is the nicest person, then it will be awkward for you because you thought she was bad. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just dont smile every time. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didnt get to know the person because of your first impression. The first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. If its pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. But your first impression is wrong because you didnt take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person. In conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time its not. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, its most of the time wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.

You can imagine all that by thinking about it or just doing it when you want to.

129,129,6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources. I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things. I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week. My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do. Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students. My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think. My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they dont add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",7,6,7,6,7,7,1392,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

133,133,25BFEA75C65A,"After reading the prompt I might think we have to make some change to the school like, what was said in the prompt we have to change the school days to a four day school week and make them to be two hours long. it can give people the hours that they need for other things and can give them time for project and stuff of that matter. The reasons why, I think we should do this because we can get more hours in the day to do things like for example: sports,homework,helping others, getting more rest in the day because maybe some people might not get more sleep during the night,some people might have job, students might have to go with their parents on a trip to somewhere or some place or also a school trip that they might go on. I well think that this is a good position to be for the change of the hours but to ever good thing there must be a bad like, a bump in the straight road ahead of you. I think for myself I do agree but there are some people that might not agree with my train of thoughts. The people who many not agree will probably say that there are not many hours in school to do things like learning new things. My train of thought thinks that we must go this way of the four day school week plan. There are so many beliefs of going this way that means we can save more resources and teachers can plan things up ahead for his/her students. I must say that there are some disadvantages of students having a four day week of school like students forgetting the things that they were teach in class and students can also not be ready for class. Some in conclusion: there are bad and good thing of having a four day week of school plan but there are some disadvantages of having it like what I said people might disagree with you but dont let them change your own train of thoughts. people also might not agree with your own believes but dont let them change who you are but the disadvantages are hard but the students can probably somethings pull it off.

Claims Knowledge is more important than Imagination. Can Imagination be helpful to you. Imagination can happen to some people. Knowledge is more important that Imagination Knowledge helps your future become successful so how will Imagination help you. It wouldnt really help you just by seeing things with your head. Lets say you played would you rather would you rather have good knowledge or have Imaginations. Is there a way for Imagination to help you? Can Imagination be helpful to you Seeing things with your head wont help anything ,but it might help you if you think of anything it will just appear ,although, its not really there.

Imagination can happen to someone A person starts to imagine things when he or she feels alone ,so he or she starts to think of an imaginary friend and they think that helps them not feel alone.

135,135,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you dont study yourself at something you failed at, then you cant become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that wont happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice. Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didnt feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then dont worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and cant move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past. Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you wont reach to the top to become successful. For example, you cant swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont wont to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up. In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better.

Two years ago,in 2017,me and my best friend,Generic_Name,are ready for our first day of middle school. We were excited to see each other,we were excited because Generic_Name moved 3 years ago, in third grade. I was sad at first but until my mom say that they move not that far,my mom takes me to his house every weekends. Now when we start school i gonna see him every day. It because we have the same class and i was happy we have the same classes together. When i got to school i see Generic_Name in a far distance and start running to each other like we never seen each other before for a very long time. Now we start learning classes together every day We where in English class to do a act of kindness to your best friend or closes friend. I say i was gonna do with Generic_Name,but then Generic_Name mom called him from the front office to pick him up. i said to Generic_Name what going on,he said ""i dont know"". soon after he didnt came to school for four days i was getting worried if his family are okay. i called to him many time,but he did not answer. until Monday he came to school looking sad, i said,""what happen"",he said that his grandma was very ill and might not make it .I felt sad too because his grandma was like my grandma. She been treating me like i was her grandson. Soon my mom took me to see the grandma to see if she okay.

I said why am i spending money on expensive stuff. Then i went to target to get a $50 dollars gift card for Generic_Name and his little brother. So in total it cost me $100 dollars. Then i went to buy balloons for the grandma, it say,""god is here to protect you"". Right after, i went back to Walmart to buy a vase that cost me $42. Then i went to shoppers to buy flowers that cost $40 dollars because i got a lot of flowers to put in the vase. On Monday we went to Generic_Name house to give the family gifts. First i give the shoes to the older brother,he seems really happy about the shoes. then i give Generic_Name a gift card as well as his little brother. Then i gave the mom a vase with flowers in them. then they ask me how much was it. i say almost about 432 dollars. They felt bad at first but i told them i had more money. Then i went to the hospital to visit the grandma to give her the balloons. She said thank you and bless your happy life. i was crying when she said that. So after that we went to church to pray and pray. When me and Generic_Name got pick up it was good news that the grandma live. We went to have a party with their family.

137,137,DC247D62DB3E,"Why do people need to follow their own instincts and ideas? I think people should make their own decision because they have to follow their own instincts and their own ideas. They have to believe themselves because if you not believe on you ,so no one can believe on you too. First of all,I think people should make their own decision because they have to believe on themselves. They dont have to think as much because the ideas come from their mine not from someone else. When they have to think of some ideas that mean their dont have to ask ideas from anyone. When they have to do some writing that mean they dont have to copy from someone or from internet. Secondly,I think people have to follow their own instinct because when something happen to you that mean you dont have to wait for someone to help you solve a problem. They dont have to seek for guidance because you have confidence in yourselves already. In addition,They have to believe on themselves because if you not believes on you by the way no one cant believes on you too. For example,like when you have to do a presentation in class and you have to present in front of teacher but you not believes that you can do it, so it mean the teacher might not believes on you too. After that is might effect to your grade because when you have to present you keep asking teacher that you say the right thing or wrong. Conclusion,I believes that people should make their own decision because they have to believes on themselves first before they ask for some help.

144,144,B7FABBC13A0F,"""Character is something what you yourself choose to make it"" I agree with John Lubbock because our character is something we make by ourselves. We make ourselves the person we become in the future. We choose our traits and characters by ourselves. Everyone has a right to choose whats best for themselves. Some people choose worst traits but others choose good. It depends on ourselves what we want to be in the future. Although some traits in a character of a person comes from experiences and most of the time bad traits comes from the worst experiences in our life. But it is completely our choice if we want to make those bad experiences a process of learning and learn something good from them. Some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences thats how most of the people get their worst traits. It is not wrong to say that people choose what they want to be and how they want their life. It is true that some traits are formed beyond our control but it depends on ourselves if we want those trait in our characters or not. Some people get too comfortable with bad traits and they dont want to change their selves for example lying is a worst trait anyone can possibly have it leads to do things that we dont even want to do but we do it anyways because we get comfortable and have no fear. ""Lying is not better than silence"" so it is way better to not say anything than lie about it. Lying is something that leads to other bad traits like dishonesty. If a person is not honest than they are not trustworthy. Trust is something very important because it is extremely hard to gain. If a person is not trustworthy than there is nothing they can do other than try not to lie. Trust is like a glass if it breaks it will never be the same. All these problems are caused by lying and it depends on our to choose if we want to lie and make ours characters full of worst traits or be a better person choose good traits. In this world there is nothing more important than being who we are and choosing best for ourselves. Our characters can formed by influences beyond our control for example something bad that happened in the past can lead a person to lie and being dishonest. Lying is not something to be proud of and bad experiences doesnt give anyone the right to lie because it doesnt matter. There is a huge difference between right or wrong. We choose our traits and what we want our characters to be like by ourselves we should know whats good and bad for ourselves. Even though sometimes being honest and speaking truth can lead to difficult situations and most people dont want to deal with difficult situations which is okay but it is important to do something right. Difficult situations make a person stronger and traits like honesty will make us proud of ourselves in future. Most of times its the journey that matters the most than the destination because it not about how we choose to become a better person it is about the experiences that led us to who we will be in the future. It is about how some people choose to learn worst possible things from their experiences but others learn good things from them. It is true to say that we become what we want to be and we choose our traits by ourselves. The harder the path will be the stronger the person becomes so it depends on ourselves to choose good or bad. There will be always two paths one will lead to good and other will lead to bad although our it depends on our own selves to choose from right or wrong,good or bad the choice is ours. If we want to be become something well be proud of or something we will be ashamed of. We write our stories by ourselves so it is all on in our hands what we want to be. Although some people might disagree and yes it is true that our characters can formed by influences beyond our control but it depends on us what we want to be. Everyone knows the difference between right or wrong. There will be consequences of choosing bad and sometimes it will be easy to not be brave and choose the worst traits for ourselves. It is completely your decision if you want to add good traits in your personality or bad traits. The difference between Joker and Batman is that Batman chose good traits while Joker turned himself evil by choosing bad traits. Even though tragic experiences led Joker to be evil but his past didnt give him the right to be evil. So,you cant be evil because of your past and becoming a better person or having good traits will lead to a better future because it past is past and future is something to look forward to. Traits like honesty and being able to do whats right without any fear will make us proud of ourselves in the future. Everyone wants to be proud of themselves and to make that possible they need to adapt good traits. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves. Bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is important to choose good traits. In conclusion the person we choose to become today will reflect on our future selves whether we choose good or bad traits. The decision is ours and what we want to be ourselves to be like it totally depends on us. Most of the problems in our lives can be solved by choosing good traits over evil. Good traits will lead to success and a better future which is very important to for ourselves while bad traits will lead to an unsuccessful future and which is not best for anyone. It is very important to choose good traits. If you want to be proud of yourself then it is a must to choose good traits. Our traits make our characters and personalities. Some people make their life miserable by choosing whats worst for them like bad traits. It is important for ourselves to choose good rather that ruin our lives with choosing something like bad traits. A person can ruin their character by choosing bad traits. Thats why it is extremely important to choose good traits for ourselves because it is good. ",7,6,7,6,7,6,2474,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
145,145,2BE976C99FDF,"Many people like Philosophers are stating Information which comes from there head and believe Its right; For people to look at and assume It Is right and agree because of what position that person has such as a Philosopher,Physician, and a Humanitarian. This Philosopher,Albert Schweitzer illustrates that an ""Example Is not the main thing In influencing others;It Is the only thing."" Although setting an example by your own behavior Is a good way to Influence others; Theirs still better and different ways to Influence people. Not all people have bad behaviors because of somebody close to them; A son could be a good and humble and the people around him could only have negativity. There are different ways such as sitting down with someone and giving advice about good behavior and what their currently doing wrong In the present. Schools even teach about It and have group of students learn about whats good and bad. In health class they are teaching about having a healthy life to be prepared in life and for whats coming In the future. Although there are examples out there like famous people that motivate others to go the same path they went,Also a good example but those are not the only ways; There are teachings or parents giving advice to have a better behavior,psychologists who people can tell whats going on in their life and they get a response of what they can do. Somebody,Anybody can demonstrate they were a good example to somebody but at the end not everybody turns out to be like them. A son can be good and humble while the people close to him or that he admires have a lot of negativity. Anybody could sit down with somebody and talk about about what there doing wrong and they could be doing the same thing;That dose not make them a good example but at least they give advice,ideas, and reveals to that person a new pathway they can take to do better. Teachers who teach about It can fill them with information they didnt know about having a healthy life; That teacher could be doing everything wrong and be negative which makes her a bad example to everybody but the students get the good advice to be better. There are people who leave good examples for others to follow but is It also the only thing. Because there are other ways to influence other people such as giving advice and teaching, while that person who gives It Is a bad example but the person who receives It follows the good advice not there bad example.",7,6,8,6,7,6,579,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
146,146,7BC73C8FBDBC,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated. Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they dont want to work. some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school. Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it wont have distractions that a online has. However, Students wont lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school. Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers wont helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didnt know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time. In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they wont be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldnt make you stressful.

People can change their first impression if they know more about each other, for example if a person that meet another at the mall they will have no time to talk about what they like to do in their free time because they has to make their purchases and my friend Generic_Name has a story with a girl that he likes, he said that was difficult to talk with her because that first time he talk to here was in the lunch line and she was hungry so she dont even pay attention to him, one day both of them have detention they star talking and meet more about each other, people can change their first impression if they give the according time to each person. A person can fix his first impression if that person was no notified about what struggles was happened the other person that day, for example when the Algebra teacher meet Generic_Name, he said that Generic_Name was quiet because Generic_Name do not like talk to much, one day Generic_Name said that he just come from El Salvador and do not speak too much English and a person that has lost a family-member if someone tried to meet him on those days anyone will be said that hes must depress or sad because non of them know the truth.

148,148,5F5E1817CCA0,"I think working with a group or working alone it depends on the person because everyone is not a same. I feel strongly that I dont like work alone because its very boring and takes long time to finish work. However, I do like to work with a group because its so much fun and you will experience with others and its more easy to do something. First, Working with a group is so much fun especially when you are do something with your best friends. When you are work with your friends they makes you laugh so hard and we do lot of fun things togethor. Some of my friends actually works well with other people. When I have a free time I like to play games with my friends. In the game you will team up with your friends and play against another team. You have to talk to your friends every single time and lesson to their idea to win game. Most of video games needs to be really good team work. You cant do anything by yourself. Second, When you are working with a group you will interaction and feel the other people. Its like social experience. Talk to your team-mates, lesson and support their idea. Working a group is way better than working by yourself. If you are learning English by yourself its very hard but if you had a teacher then its much easy to learn and quickly Finally, You can do things very quickly because there is a more than one person working. If your mom says clean your house. You have to clean entire house by yourself and it takes long time to finish but if you clean with your brother or sister then its quite faster than clean by yourself.

When i was a child my grandmother shows me many ways to set things and advice, i would like to say i want to teach my friends and others peoples things like they dont know, another ways is tell them or teaching like how to play soccer, how to find this, etc. In my life i have learn many thing like i never think i do like maintenance in toys, fix computers, and other things. And i like my teacher teach very well because is one way to learn better others teachers dont like teach very well or just like to be angry with the students in the class and thats the reason why the students say i dont like the teacher because is angry or dont teach very well. Give examples is the vest way to understand thing like i never understood. behavior is other thing how behavior we are in the class or in the house, our behavior is one part important in the life because the the others peoples could say that person have a good behavior i would like he can tell me a advice or example how to make this or fixed. A example is not the main reason to influence others,there are many like the peoples watching you. just to watch others peoples i am learning new tools for the future. I have no plan after High School the only thing is i like technology and electricity the most two parts of mi, the life is like a second we can lose everything or die.

150,150,60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill, I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"". The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google. I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle. In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

151,151,EAD2625A1711,"In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Their courses of study In high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. Many young students do not have the capacity of choosing a career at that time of age. I believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. Student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on. Inexperienced of not knowing what they want,students could make the take wrong choices about their future career. When students enter to high school they are normally around fourteen years old, young students of that age are normally not worry about their future career yet. Students mentality starts changing abut their career when they are having more knowledge about what they really what to be. When kids are around sixteen is when are maturing about their future and looking at things differently. students do not have the capacity of choosing their whole future career at the young of age. When students are force to choose a career when they first enter to high school, they could choose the wrong career. Most students know that choosing the wrong career could affect the later on in the future. Lets say that they choose a career when they enter to high school, but they are unhappy. They are going to be stuck their whole life time with something that does not makes them happy. When people work with things they like or enjoy they attempt to work harder and better. Most people change their mind almost everyday about something they like or do not like, well it is the same with choosing a career. Wasting time is something no one likes to do, and specially when is about their future. Making kids choose their career at a young age could mess them up and they would have to do things all over again. When choosing the wrong career, accepting the consequences and restart over again with a new career of their choice. Making good research,planing things out first with a good process will help with their future career. Most students are not prepare to pick their future career during high school. Most students have no knowledge of what they want to be later in life. Some students could make the wrong choice of picking a career they do not want.

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff. The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aims low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there. Some people will star high thinking that by doing that they would be able to get on top of stuff and all problems that are along with that are somehow fix without putting any effort or even think about it for a second,people should star a bit lower than that because that way they can work built that character that can help with achieven their goal by just putting a bit of effort and try to not aim high and fall short. For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it.",7,6,4,5,4,5,3083,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 4, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
153,153,5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games apps which include school knowlegdes. However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted. Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of peoples views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students business. Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students. Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones.

Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers. Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and its made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers. By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well. If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesnt mean that every student has to use their phones too. Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones its only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop. If we were aloud to use our cell phones during school we would not pay attention to our teachers and we would never get our work done. Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted.

156,156,01B3FDB3FD57,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" Now imagine yourself as a beginning engineer, sitting at your desk, aggravated because you cant come up with a new invention. All you have around you are textbooks but no image or thought of what your invention may be. If only you could imagine a new invention of some sort then maybe you could build something. But with no imagination, how can you build knowledge? I agree with Einsteins quote. I believe imagination is more important than knowledge. I agree with Einsteins quote because having imagination is how weve had all our inventions yet. Without imagination how were many of the things we own invented? For example, the telephone. The telephone couldnt have been invented without someone imagining a device where you could communicate without leaving your home. You need imagination in order to make new things. Another example would be the camera. Whoever invented it, had to have imagination in order to think of a device that captures any moment almost in an instant. Even I, as a student, need imagination in order to make new things. For example, when making an essay, such as this one, I need to imagine of a good story hook that goes along with the prompt. Furthermore, I believe in Einstein quote because without imagination, knowledge is almost useless. For example, when learning a new vocabulary list. You may know all the definitions but you cant put them in your own words or use the words in different instances. Why? Because you cant imagine it. You cant picture it, you just know the definitions. Another example is when reading a book. Knowing how to read isnt even near of what you need to fully comprehend a book. You need to imagine it. Picture the story in your mind in order to fully understand the books theme, setting and tone. Lastly, I agree in Einsteins quote because without imagination, all our decisions would be made carelessly. For instance, before you speak or move, most of the time you imagine what the outcome of that action will be. If not, the outcome wont be for the better. Another instance is when in an experiment, you hypothesize what the result of the experiment will be. That takes imagination. When signing a contract, its needed to imagine the consequences of signing and not signing the contract. In other words, you need to imagine things before you decide to take them on. Knowledge isnt the only thing that will help you when making decisions. In conclusion, Einsteins quote is correct in my perspective. Knowledge isnt the most important factor to have, imagination is key to everything you do and will do. You cant fully understand most things without imagining them. Cant go on inventing things before imagining them first. Also, you wont be able to make good decisions before imagining the outcome. All in all, imagination is also how youll enjoy your life. Knowledge is great and all but it cant bring others as much happiness as imagination can. Its how weve been happy for all these years. Imagination is how we have gone so far in this world and how much weve survived. ",8,9,10,8,10,9,25,"conventions 9, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
157,157,D3D5841674F5,"Technology has positive effects on peoples lives because they can help you with many information that your trying to look up for example if your trying to shop, play games, or even buy or read books. They help you do a lot when you really need it. Technology is not for only buying or doing any other things its for doing projects in class or a if your doing your homework, applying for jobs, and applying for college. Here are my 3 reasons why technology is positive for peoples lives. First, lets say that you want to go to college but you cant go to the college because you dont have time or maybe that you just cant go. What you can do is that you can go on your laptop and go to the website and apply there and you can take your time on it and not have to worry about going there. You can apply to many collleges online and that is really great so you can get accepted to many colleges out in other countries or states. When my brother was in 12th grade he wanted to go personaly to the colleges but he said some of them were too far and that he didnt want to go because he needed to do something really important and so what he did was that he went online and started applying for 5 colleges and he got accepted to 4 of them. He said it was not even hard. Having to fill papers with people takes up so much time that you will be there the whole day instead of you doing it online at home and not having to rush up anything and if you mess up the laptop tells you that there is something that you typed up is wrong. Second, If you dont feel like going to the store because your just tired and you just dont want to go out but you need some clothes for that night and you dont have any then what you can do is go online and start shopping there and buy everything you need for that night and you will be fine with out the need of going to the mall or going to any other store. At the same time even tho your not going out if you shop online there is a posibility that your clothes that you ordered does not fit you or it might not come on time when you really need it. The process of returing it and everythig is just too much. Thats why people prefer that its better to go to the store and just buy it from there. If that was me I would prefer to go to the mall or the store to. When you go to the stores sometimes you have to handle some workers that are aggressive and they have a bad attitude. I dont like seeing people with bad attitude it makes me mad and it always makes me just go away and not look at them anymore. Third, In school sometimes you have projects and you have class work but you cant find information about your research or anything about your topic or about your class work then you have to find information online. When you ask your teachers what they would say is that go on your laptop and look it up and then go ask your classmates if you cant find anything. For my US VA History project are teachers gave us many different websites that we can use and they were very helpful I got all my information from there. I didnt even have to go ask him for help or anything. Also when you have test its mostly technology because you dont really have test on paper anymore now its on laptops and you dont have to write anything now its only typed it is really easy and fast. Even essays it used to be essays on paper and now its essays in laptops. In conclusion, These were my 3 main reasons why technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. There can be many positive effects on technology but theses 3 were mostly about how technology is even tho you do not interact with other humans face-to-face it is good doing online things. There are better chances that you get many things done and also you get the chance to have some time off of looking and talking to people. If I were to ask many people which side they prefer they would choose the positive effect side. ""Its better technology instead of talking to people"".",7,6,7,7,7,6,2949,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

159,159,30A7E68EFC88,My position is this argument is that behind every success there is a failure. Its important to understand that failure is not something bad its just something in the way of your success. These are my opinion on what i thing about. these paragraphs that you are about to look at have a mixer of things from hard working to failure just a little background of what you are about to read. Starting a company can be really hard because there are a lot of failure that youll have to go through to get to success. Because you wont be a big company from the start you have to built up to have a big company. For example the company apple it started in a garage and now its one of the biggest company to be know. Failure is just something thats in the way of you becoming successful. Because what it takes is hard work that you need to put into your company or whatever you are trying to be successful at. If not someone else thats trying to get the some thing as you will get it before you. Because you did not work hard enough Becoming successful in something is a hard thing. Because of other people can be trying to do the same thing you are trying to do and sometimes not everyone is successful because of someone else that worked hard then them of the successes. Being the best at what you do is difficult because people are going to bring you down those are failure because they hate on your successes and what you have accomplished. Working hard on something that you on youll be successful in because if not other people that are on the same race as you trying to be successful are working more harder then you are going to be more successful because of the hard work they put in. If you are starting a company try to be the best at what you are doing because thats the only way youll be successful because you are the best at what you are doing and no one else cant beat you to the top. My position is this argument is that behind every success there is a failure. Its important to understand that failure is not something bad its just something in the way of your success. Those are my opinion on the argument ,5,5,4,5,6,6,637,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 4, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
160,160,EFBF293CC2AF,"Dear, Local hospital manager I would love to visit your hospital because i can imagine my self walking through those doors, smelling medicine and noticing the sound of machines, seeing surgents running and rushing towards the surgery room, soon to save a humans life. I wanna visit your hospital because i think its pretty cool and brave what you guys do. One reason why i would love to visit your hospital would be because i think that the hospital is a very cool place, surgents get the feeling when they save someones life and they get to use some cool machines that they probably havent used until they started to working in the hospital and they get to open up people and see the inside of a persons body. One other reason why i think its pretty cool, is that there is three different types of doctors, the first kind of doctor would be an Intern, which is a doctor that just started there first year as one and that is learning to be the best, another kind is a mid tern resident, which is the second to highest level, one last kind of doctor is the highest which is a resident,i think its smart that you guys have that because i think it keeps everything organized and it keeps every doctor in order. One example why i want to visit the hospital is that i want to make people that they are in good hands, that they are going to be safe, also i wanna become one of the best surgents out there, most of all i just wanna help and save lives, i think its cool that surgents get to use machines and other tools to open up people that need medical help. When i was smaller i would have to take care of my sister because my mom would be busy going to work, one day my sister got cut when she was playing outside she was bleeding a lot that i grabbed some paper and rolled it around her leg and then called my mom because it seem so deep, ever since that day i wanted to be a surgent because i didnt feel disgusted by the blood and stuff, i thought it was pretty cool that i cured her leg, and stopped it bleeding. I wanna have the opportunity to visit your hospital because i wanna save peoples lives when i grow up and have that desperate feeling when you save someones life. One reason why i want to have that feeling is because, i just wanna save peoples life and make them better, even though it might get exhausted its gonna be worth it because at the end of the day i think of how i saved someones life. Another reason is because i wanna see how the hospital works and how every gets in managed, i want to learn if there is anymore different kind of doctors for example, there is cardio heart surgery, plastic surgery and more, i wanna be a surgent when i grow up because i wanna save peoples lives, i feel like there is so much good around the world that i wanna do good when i grow up. One example is that, me being a surgent would be a good idea because i can learn and help people that are struggling in life,i wouldnt just get to help people lives inside the building, i would get to save someones life outdoor of the building too because if something happens to someone then i can help them, if i become a surgent then im gonna work hard and learn about medicine to be the best and help anyone that comes through those doors. I wanna become into a doctor/surgent because i just started watching this show and its very interesting because its about doctors saving other peoples lives and how they struggle and how that connects with there life because they feel like they havent been spending time with there friends or there family because they just have been busy of work and i feel like ive been learning on how i can not struggle in life if i do work as a surgent. I wanna visit the hospital because when i grow up i wanna become into a surgent and learn about all the medicine out there. One reason why you should let us visit the hospital would be because i wanna get the opportunity to feel to be a surgent one day and learn about everything. Another reason why you should let us visit is because if some kids are interested into becoming into a surgent then they can think of taking a medicine class in high school and learn about it more so they can prepare them self if they become into a doctor or surgent, being a surgent isnt just about opening people up and sowing them and saving peoples lives, its about learning and learning because every time you do something you have never done before in your life, you have just learned something and by getting the opportunity of just going to see the hospital and seeing how it works, i just have learned something new even though i didnt do anything other than watching. One example why you should let us visit is because we would be learning something new and getting to feel how everything works around the hospital if we were to work as a surgent or doctor. I mostly wanna become into a doctor because i think its cool how doctors are brave and work and how good they are at there jobs, mostly its cool because they learn something new everyday and at the end of the day they have saved a lot of peoples lives or changed peoples lives. A local company i would love to visit is the hospital because i feel like the hospital is very cool, the feeling of saving someones life is incredible, and you get to learn everything about medicine/medical stuff. I think working at a hospital is a gift because you get to learn and everything and save peoples lives and most of all you learn. I hope you consider thinking of letting my school visiting the hospital. sincerely, Generic_Name ",8,7,8,8,7,7,3521,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Generic_Name assumed, you can realize that the negative attitude will destroy what you appreciate, then the positive manner heals your mistake and gives you a success after. Last, the correct or positive attitude can value your personality, so that affects the way people look at you. You must not expect people judge you that you are a great person or you are successful. People estimate you through your manner toward to future or what you had done in the past. Will people say you are successful student, even though, you do not expect any higher education, absolutely no because how they know that you will have a job in the future or you just ask for help without any work. Nevertheless, if you are a student having a positive attitude for the future, such as you are willing to study or you want to contribute yourself to community, college or company will value you at a positive way that you are diligence and helpfulness. And then, they may ask you to show more your ability that can make you are more successful. In summary, positive attitude is definitely important for your life and your success. Understanding positive manner designs your wonderful day. Also, you must have positive attitude to discover your fitting path to the success. Finally, positive attitude shows your true personality to people around you, and gives you a chance to catch their attention, so they can give you a opportunities to you to become a successful person. If you want to be successful person, you must have a positive attitude.",8,7,7,7,6,8,1841,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
172,172,E3E6D43F34B2,"Should our school extend the school day two hours? No, I strongly disagree with extending two hours to school day. By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. Furthermore, if there is 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago. In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. Students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students. Finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial then the new idea of extending two hours of school. If we want to focus and have good attendace, therefore we should not extend the school hours. In conclusion, we should keep the school days and school hours as it is.

Someone might find going to a state park enjoyable because thee will be a lot of fun activities you can do there. Also because then you can discover new things there. In state parks there are varities of new resources and things you may enjoy. There are more fun activities but in my opinon i think going to a state park is more enjoyable and fun. Going to a state park is a good way to spend your time because it can keep you energized and active. State parks do have a lot of space where you can sit and talk to your family or friends. State parks may have a food court aswell. State parks can be small or big but it depends on which one you are going to. Usally state parks are big and filled with beautiful flowers. There may be a age limit on some of the state parks activities. You may think that parks are boring but you are wrong because parks do have fun activities but i know some parks are boring but parks like state park, community parks, and national parks arent.

There are different timings when the state park will open each day so you may need to take some time out to go there. On weekends the state parks may be full and you may not even have space to sit but on weekdays there not that full so i think you may wanna go on a weekday so you can have enough space to play around or spend some time with your family, friends. Taking small kids to state park can make them happy and have time to play around. At some state parks you may find some beatiful butterflys flying around, isnt that beautiful.

174,174,CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new. One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didnt know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasnt that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends. Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldnt play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesnt take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasnt a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldnt be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didnt know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. Im in middle school and I couldnt get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.

175,175,2A96CE614119,"A famous British writer once said ""your character will be what you yourself choose it."" His name was John Lubbock. What he wanted to state is that we choose what we want to be from here on out and, that know one chooses for us. Another question that was asked was, ""is our character formed by influences beyond our control."" No we control all of our actions so what John wanted to say is that our character and character traits are based on the choices we make and still making. We are always in control and know what we are doing on a daily bases. We always know what well happen based on the actions we take, its common sense. Its like when you argue to a teacher we know its bad and we know what comes after that and that is going to the principals office. Nothing is never out of our control is weather we want to stop it or just let it happen. Most of the time our actions are based on bad things like smoking for an example we know its bad but its in influences or the people that make us do it. So thats why we need to stop listening to that bad side and listen to our good side. The character we are right now as a person is based on the life choices we made. If it wasnt for the good or even the bad choices we made in life we wouldnt be the person we today. Everything is bases on what we do and what we dont do. For example is we study hard enough and work hard as well we can get to the college or job of our dreams. But to do that we have to make good life choices and good decisions. Like i said before the person we are today is based on ALL the choices we made starting from when we were little to how we are right now. We are far from perfect but we try to make the best decisions or perfect is you say. As we humans we know we are not perfect and shall never be perfect but that doesnt mean we dont try to make perfect decisions. For starters we know our rights from our wrongs. So we know our good decisions from our bad decisions and you would think that its easy to choose the right one but in reality its not. The more bad it is the more we want to do it. Its just human nature one well say BUT we most of the time we dont choose that side want to know why. Its because we are always in power and its never out of our control. Some yes but most others NO. In conclusion we know that nothings never out of our power. We know that person we are today is based on the life choices we made. That we know our rights from our wrongs, our positive and negative. And what John Lubbock wants to tell us. That our character and character traits is based on the type of person we are that is what we wanted to tell us.

177,177,5F998012DDCD,"The argument related to distance learning has often been a topic of interest to many people. Nowadays, many scholars support the idea of distance learning and it has been getting a great acceptance among many societies. Although some people think distance learning make students careless in doing their work, nevertheless, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. To begin, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it saves the time they would spend by going to school. For example, it can take ten to forty minutes for a student to go to school. This shows that going to school takes students precious time and makes them unproductive. Clearly, no one wants to waste his/her time on transportation. Furthermore, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage. For instance, students who spend their time on technological materials know more how to accomplish technology related tasks in a short period of time compared to students with no experience. This proves that taking online classes prepare students for higher education and learning. Obviously, the use of technology is growing fast in this age. Overall, students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. This is because distance learning saves the time they would spend by going to school and makes them more effective and efficient in their technology usage.

178,178,2F93B934ED27,"Control Our Characters According to what the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock have been say, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Our character formed by influences beyond our control. We should all choose to control our character because that will save us from trouble, trust our self, and have a lot of relationships with friends. First, we should all choose to control our character that will help to save many of us from trouble because being in trouble that very bad and many people will not talk or keep in touch with us or have any friends also. For example, Generic_Name always many students keep saying bad stuff to him to make him fight with them, but he never care about what they say he always go to tell the security about them. He dose not want to be in trouble, that make them very angry because they are in trouble not him. That makes Generic_Name safe, and out from trouble. We have to be strong enough always and find another way to control our character to be in safe said, not being strong by fight and be in trouble. Control our character will make us trust our self. Second, we should choose to control our character that will make us trust our self because when we control our character we will trust our self in everything. For example, Generic_Name works in the hospital hard to make everyone feel better, not sick one time one person was sick about to died, but she dose not cry because of that she control her character and she trust her self, So she give him a medicine and he dose not died he feel very well. Generic_Name never give up she always trust her self and she control her character with everything. We must control our character so we never give up and we can trust our self. In the other side, some people may argue that choose to control our character will make some people think that we are sick, scared, alone. Thats true because when we choose to control our self a lot many people will think that way. However, we choose to control our character because that will make everyone want to be with us we will have big relationship with everyone. For example, Generic_Name always control her character she also has big relationship with everyone many people want to be her friends they like how she control her character. People are very likely to people who have good character and to people control their character thats why we have to control our character. Lastly, We all should choose to control our character to be out from trouble, to trust and believe our self, and to have a lot of friends. The result from when we control our character always we will be away from any trouble. Also, when we control our character we will trust our self in all the stuff and in anything even if its hard. Therefore, many friends we will have while we control our character, friends do not like to have friends who is always angry dose not know what to do they like the friends who always control their character and who know everything. To control our character is not hard if we need a better life.",7,7,6,7,8,8,630,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
179,179,D001F6D3A0D0,"Everybody would like to be succesful in the life, and thats possible, but is not easy you have to try one time and one more time until you have what you want; it doesnt matter how many times you try for it. In my opinion there are a lot of people that if they fail one time they give up and shouldnt be like that because you will be happy if you complete your goal, you will be a good example to help others to be successful, you can earn more than you expected. Complete your goal can be really important for you, and will make you happy, for example, my Mom wanted to have a beauty salon, but she knew that it wouldnt be easy; she started with a small room and a few customers, sometimes she didnt have custumers, and that made her think to close the beaty salon, but she never gave up, now she has a big room with a lot of customers; she is happy because she is doing what she likes, and the most important part she never give up. That is why we have to try many times until we are happy for what we have or what we are doing. Some people would like to have an example to make their goals, and you can be a good example if you don,t give up at firts time that you fail, for example, I have a cousin, Generic_Name, she was a bad student; she didnt care about her grades, tests, homeworks, and nothing about the schools. when I moved to live with her, she saw my grades and all that things that I do. She stared to ask me how I can have good grades in the tests and be successful, and I said to her,"" you need to have more enthusiasm for the school"" ,and now she has a really good grades and she is going to graduate this year. If we dont stop even if we fail, we can hel others to be successful. Some people might say that you lost the time trying something many times, however, you can earn more than you expect if you try as much as you can, for example, I saw a video on facebook; there was a man that was loking for a job to support his family; he went to many places, but nobody gave him a job. One time he was walking on the street, and he saw a man trying to fix his car, and without thinking he went to help the other man after that the man was thankful for the help, and he offered a job for the man. The man who was without job; he didnt know that he will get a job on that situation, what would happend if the man would be sleeping in his house; he would never get that job. That is why we never have to lose the enthusiasm to be successful; we never know what is prepared for us. It is clear that you will feel good if you complete your goals, and you will be a good example of persistence to help others to be successful, you will earn more than you expect if dont give up at the first time that you fail, and maybe is not easy, but you have your whole life to make it happen, and nobody will tell you when to stop; it doesnt matter how many times you try or you fail. The most important part is that you will be successful if you are constant and and what you are doing. ",6,6,8,7,7,5,2867,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Having a good attitude helps people to be more intelligent and to face their problems. It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn. Nobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes. On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. People often have opportunities but they dont know how to confront them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like Generic_Name, the mother of a girl, who had face many problems in her life. She never give up and she always was with a positive attitude, when Generic_Name was 30 years old, one of her sons died from Cancer. At that time Generic_Name was very upset, but an opportunity appear on her life. She decides to take the opportunity with a good attitude. Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time. Otherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. They think about others, even when they dont have to much. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time. Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience.

Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself. but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test youve taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read. but therere time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together, but still therere some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend. imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or hell stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money. young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",5,6,5,5,5,5,1965,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you. First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter its no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person. Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc. In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.",5,6,6,6,5,6,1462,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
186,186,AB9527C4A312,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peopless lives. Humans use the technology for some differents things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. Also,the people dont need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. technology make all more easy than can be. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples: Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they dont need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they dont use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people dont work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people. Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they dont need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people dont had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they dont care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use. Technology can change the way of people live and think. for example. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation. Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you cant communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and dont want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.",5,5,7,4,4,6,2299,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age. The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support. The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society. Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild. Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. Thats why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone. In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported.

Its a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages . One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored an tired of it. Its not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they wont have enough time to make more hours in their job. If the students assist to school for more hours they got the chance to learn more and improve their skills. In those 10 hours they can even get an extra class , a class that they want.

190,190,71A9098715EB,"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you. My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you. People will say that someone with more life experious will help others more then they can help them-self but they can make it so much further then others. Im not saying people shouldt have rolemodle just dont do something because someone else did it do it better then they ever could. My friend Generic_Name wanted to be a football player his whole life he was the best in our middle school team, but his mom and dad hated the idea they thought all football players end up hurt so he didt play in high school he didt like any other sports so he just went to school and went home. this left Generic_Name with not that many friends and he is sad and deperested today. Making your own decisions all the time can be hard and at some point you may fail but if you keep trying you can make it big one day. There are many reasons to have someone make decisions for you it would be much less stressful and you would have less chance of failing, but everyone need to grow up at some point and do what is best for them, You cant live under someone your whole life at some point you will be on your own. Those are the reasons I believe everyone should make there own decisions in the long run you will be 10 times the person if you trust your-self and do it your way. A person should never put there life in the hand of anyone but them-self. If someone stops talking to you because they dont like a decision you make and didt do what they said to do then they dont deserve to be in your life.",7,7,7,8,7,6,1469,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives? A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption. If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives? The city councils debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives?

193,193,DCDED7261D03,"""Your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" everyone should be free of deciding their own character this is important because it can help with being more confident about yourself while making difficult choices, making clear what your goals for the future are, and makes easier to show who you really are to other individuals . In the other way some people believe that our character is formed by the difficulties and influences beyond our control. First, feeling confident about yourself is one of the best ways to succeed in life, it makes easier when deciding difficult choices, sometimes when people go through difficult moments in their lives, being confident with their self can help them choosing the best decision by just looking at the positive way of their decisions. For example, every time people visit a new locations they should feel confident with their selves while creating new friendships or business. Secondly, setting your goals is not as easy as it sounds, because you have to know what you really want, when people know what their goals are they have to work really hard and encourage their selves to achieve it. If people chose their own character its easier to set their goals because they really know who they are. For example, one of my goals is to graduate from high school. So,I need to put a lot of effort and hard working to achieve it. In the other way, some people claim that our character if formed by the influences beyond our control, some of those difficulties might be what your parents want or economic resources. Also, when people let others create their life choices or character they dont enjoy their life as how they want to enjoy it. Foe example, if your you let your parents decide what to do with your future, you might dont like that decision and that would not be really who you are. In addition, making your own character influence in how you show others who you truly are, this is important because, it feels better doing something that you chose and want than doing something that other individuals what you to do or difficult situations. In conclusion, I am agree with ""Johns"" quote because everyone should be able do decide what that really want to become, feeling confident with their selves, having clear all their goals and work hard to achieve them all, your character shouldnt be former by influences beyond their control. You should be able to show everyone who you really are.",8,7,7,7,7,8,3126,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
194,194,B6B85CE5C8F5,"When it comes to trying to be someone, is it better to improvise or follow the script all the time? Everyone needs to have their own individuality and be original instead of trying to be something else because that way you learn more about yourself. Also, you are acknowledging different methods about how to be better than yourself. And one of the most important things, you could make a good influence in someone elses life and teach him/her how to find their path in their own way. No matter what happens, you always have to follow yourself. When you learn more about yourself it means that you do not just learn things that you already know about yourself, you also learn new things that you did not know about yourself. For example, one day you are going to the basement of your house which is really big and put some good music. While you are listening to your favorite songs from your playlist, you are dancing according to the tempo and doing the dancing moves that you usually do. After dancing for a long while, suddenly you let the music take control over you and you make a back flip without practicing it before. You are very surprised because you did something that you did not know you could do and after that, you keep practicing that move and perfectioning it and it comes out natural. That is how you learn more about yourself. You are acknowledging different methods to be better than yourself. This means you will do whatever is right in order to become a better person. For example, Robert Downey Jr used to have a terrible life by consuming drugs and other things that got him in trouble with the law. He even went to court for all the messy things he did. After a long time taking bad decisions, he finally decided to make things better for the people who cares about him and specially for him. It took him over 5 years for him to get back on his feet; with his own effort and the support from his family and friends, he started to make a good difference for the world. Right now, Robert is one the best actors in Hollywood, he has an excellent life with his wife and kids on his side, and is a great influence for millions of people. That is how you acknowledge different methods to be better that yourself. Some people say that you are copying someone else when you try to be yourself. However, they are wrong because you actually are listening to those tips that you have heard and following them under your own perspective. That way you are definitely writing your own script but at the same time, giving the deserved credit to the person who gave you those tips. For instance, when you are trying to get a girl that you met in a party but you have no idea of what to do in order to get her attention. You ask your friend for some advice to accomplish your goal so you do not go through a bad experience. He tells you what to do exactly and shows you with some women at the party and now you have some ideas of what you can do. So before you reach out to that girl, your friend tells you ""be yourself all the time"" and you get the courage to talk to her. After following those examples in your own way, the girl started to have deep feelings for you and everything worked out a lot well and make some influence to some of your friends who need that kind of help. That is how you follow your own script with your own terms. In conclusion, it is very important that you have be yourself all the time because it shows that you do not need somebody in order to be somebody. You learn about yourself so you can get to know your own person more than you can know about an anime character. You acknowledge new ways to become better than yourself like if you were in a videogame, you are going to the next level slowly. You make a good influence by doing things as right as possible and you give people some benefits out of it. To be yourself you have to do what your gut tells you to do if you think it is going to give some benefits in some way.",7,7,9,7,7,7,2454,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Also, will need it when your in school you well need it everyday by writing your name to writing a whole essay and it needs to not have any grammar problems. You will also need when you have a job and if you become a teacher you will need to learn the more detail information.

Finally, this is the reason why its important to learn English because you will need to know the grammar to it.

I agree with John Lubbock because not everyone has the same intentions as the people who surround us, we choose our own path, and people are raised differently. Not everyone has the same intentions as the people they hang out with. Not because I want to go to college and become a nurse, means that my best friend, that I spend most of the time with, would want to be a nurse or be in a medical field as me. Some people might think differently and say that we are influenced by the people we spend our time with. We choose who we want to become. People have their own dreams and choose their own path. We choose our own paths. I once got invited to a party where I knew there were going to be lots of teens drinking and doing drugs, so I told my friend, who invited me, that I didnt wanted to go because I new it was bad. For some people it is just fun and dont think about the consequences. Not everyone thinks the same, and people are raised differently. We were all raised differently. For siblings, I think it is different because they are being raised by the same people and have almost the same points of view, but that does not mean they are or think the same. There could be two sisters being raised the same but one might have different habits or opinions than the other. At the end of the day we choose who we want to be. We choose who we want to be. Yes, we are influenced by the people we see everyday and we might just take it as inspiration, but we are the ones who work towards our goals and not anyone else.

199,199,EC0B04508F7C,"WORKING IN GROUP Why the most students like working in group and not alone? the most students prefer working with friends, because in schools the works or homework require more the one students ,but .Some people said of working alone is more benefits for the students. I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work. The first reason, if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work, sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk. In second reason helping together, because you can ask if you work is good or opinions about the work and look of more information. You can help for materials if you friend not have, and helping together if you consider the work is good or not or change sometime or have or ideas you can tell. The third reason you have more time for you work if you working in group. Because sometime the teachers not give much day for you work ,and the work is hard, and require much information you can divide the work with you friend . The finally check the information, and put together or you can decide what part you wants working or what parts you can create. In conclusion is more essay for you if working in group because you can make friends , you can helping together, and you have more time for you work.",7,5,6,5,6,6,3445,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
200,200,A38187259EEE,"For my own opinion , I think most students that have problems at school should take online or video classes at home to make it easier for them to learn and study. Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you dont have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences. Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I dont do good at it ? "" or "" What if I cant do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn. For me if I could choose , Ill choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me. So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say "" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people dont think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school.

201,201,FEDCB06D743F,"Dear Generic_Name, It has come to my attention that schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations trough interships and shadowing opportunities, to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of job. However Im in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers. Allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on. Every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, But for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as others. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life. Every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they dont feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; However companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to. Not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they dont have the sources to reach their goals or they cant because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they dont have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. I believe im not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life. Lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who dont have any chance on achieving their goals. its very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure. Thank you for taking your time on this matter and allowing me to express my opinion and my greatfullness.

204,204,0369AD4B5726,"I would agree with being honest at all times because if Iam honest, Iam telling the truth and Im not lying towards anyone. The reason why being honest is the best policy is that people can really trust me if they ask me a question or if I need their help with any of my work even if they are not honest or completely honest with any of their work. I think that honesty would be number one in my personality because people get smarter when they grow and honesty will be in my life mostly from the start. Another reason why honesty is very important in my life would be to believe that Im not going to fail a test or I wont get bullied in the future. But sometimes honesty would fail and some people are going to get angry with me when they actually trusted me. Then they might have learned a lesson to not trust me in their entire life ever again. That would be sad if I said I were honest that this would happen and I was actually positive about it just to make my friend or my family member happy instead of thinking about all the negative things that are going to happen which actually might have a tiny chance to happen or not happen. After a negative relationship about honesty happens with my friend or family member, they would disagree on my honesty and might never trust me again and find someone smarter than me. Later in my life, my friend or family member might apologize to me when they could not trust me in the past. The relationship with my family member or friend might come back together again and they might agree with my honesty once again and we might never get into a fight about honesty and relationships ever again. But what if my friend or family member found more than one person besides me to trust in their honesty. We might have a huge debate going on about that and also get into a fight that would never stop. It would be best to not have a huge argument about honesty and I can meet with the other person face to face and have a conversation with them which is not that harmful and nobody will hurt anyones feelings or my friend or family member would not allow me to be with them their entire life anymore. That would be better because it would be best to gather as many people as I know because then me and other people who are very good with honesty can help my friends and my family members stop thinking about negative relationships and we can make them think about positive relationships so they wont get stressed out or they wont have any attacks when they think about anything that makes them feel sad or other dangerous thoughts like suicidal thoughts, dying by doing drugs, getting into a car crash etc. Even if someone tells me that they cannot trust me and they disagree with my honesty, I dont have any dangerous thoughts about death. I will fight back for my position in honesty even if many people trusted my honesty and I failed them in my honesty. Still, my honesty is not a failure. I will be honest my entire life and I will never lose my most important personality about me which is honesty. If I think Im going to fail a test on the first attempt. Im always honest that I will not fail this test today and Im going to try so hard on this test that I pass and I will win and be happy with my own honesty that I trust. Sometimes if I forget to study for a test, its not honestys fault I failed. Its my fault I did not study for the test because most of the answers I got wrong in the test is because I guessed instead of knowing the correct answer. If I cant trust honesty or if I dont need it now. Ill use my honesty if I really need it help me succeed so I wont be a failure in life. I would want everyone to have honesty as their number one personality because honesty can really help everyone solve many conflicts that are not easy to solve in one attempt and I might need help with it. Most people disagree with being honest at all times and they say its not their number one personality because people first have to learn the true meaning of honesty and how it can actually help me succeed in your life. Most of the time, people think that very smart people have the best honesty and they might agree with their honesty for some reason. But theyre wrong, I can trust everyones honesty. Its not like people who are not smart dont have the best honesty and people who are smart have the best honesty, theyre equal. People who are not that smart can grow in the future and their honesty can lead to many people supporting someone who was not smart in the past and is now smart in the future. Same with smart people, they can either continue to grow or their smartness has a tiny chance of dropping. Then people in the future for some reason would continue to trust smart people even if I know that their smartness and their true honesty has dropped which would mean that they started to lie in the future and in the past they would tell the truth. That would be the reason why smart people in the past might start to lie about most of their things in the future if nobody teaches them to never get into the non honesty mode. The right people that can reteach me about honesty if you lose it would be either your family members or teachers because you dont goof around with my family and my teachers that often, its mainly with my friends because they can try to get me into a different world to forget about honesty and everyone will wonder what happened with being honest and why cant they trust me anymore. Same with people who grow, my friends and family members will be suprised how I learned to be honest and how most people can trust me now. They would be put in a totally different world and they would be thinking. ""How did they change in the future?"" ""I thought they would still be the same their entire life?"" Finally, once they figured out how I changed in the future. They will probably inform everyone about the person that has changed. That is why honesty is number one for everyone lives and its best.",4,6,7,6,6,7,35,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 4"

208,208,3CDD56FF3477,"Today, at school, most people are required by teachers to work with a group in order to prepare them to work in society and be able to communicate with their future colleague. I believe that there is more benefits for students to work with others rather than working by their own because they can share their ideas together and dont work alone allow them to be faster. First, by working with a group students can share their ideas and discuss on the work they have to do. By sharing their ideas, their work will be stronger and longer because every person of the group bring his own point of view, his own examples or experiences and their own way to work, to proceed. While working alone can be difficult when the student have no ideas or is lost and dont know how to do his work, so in a group they can help each others to understand and push them to work For example, if in a group a person have more facilities on the topic than others, she can help others who have more difficulties to work. Working by groups allow students to grow and enrich their skills to be better because they learn from each others. Working with a group help them to be prepared for working by their own. Secondly, working with other students can be more efficient. Students, by sharing ideas, are working faster because they dont have to find all by them self and do all the work. They can share tasks so one person have one job rather than do everything alone so its more efficient and beneficent for all the group but also for the teacher because the work will be done faster, so the class can move on and do more things during the year and if they help each other they probably dont need help from teachers, so teachers can be focus on students with real difficulties. Working with a group can prepare them for their future jobs so they can be able to communicate to other people and learn how to work not only for them self but also for everyone and they learn to help each other so they will be more productive in the future. For example, if in the future, they will work in a society where they need to work together on a project with many people and their boss dont want them to work by their own, they already learn how to be efficient in a community so it wont be a problem for them. They will be already used to work with a group and they will know how to proceed. Some people can think that working by groups can do the opposite and prevent students to work by talking, laughing, having fun with their friends, which can be distracting them or if a person in the group dont want to work it can impact others work so its unfair for people who really want to work and are motivated to have a good grades. However, students can keep working at home if they are late on their work, they can communicate by phone or they can meet during the weekend or after school so the work can be done in time or teachers can make the groups in order to prevent distractions. Also, if a person dont want to work and impact others work, the person will be graded lower which can motive her to work or if its not the case, students from the group can help her and to be motivated and push her to work by giving her little tasks to do or easy tasks. In conclusion, I think that working with a group bring more benefits for students rather than working alone because they can share their ideas, their way to proceed and work faster by helping each others. If teachers want their students to be more efficient and enrich them self for their future, its important that they do more activities and work in groups.

213,213,E21D14227555,"A wise man once said the usage of technology has had an impact on humans contact for centuries.The usage of technology has had a positive impact with human contact because people can see what others are doing for fun and it can result in finding people that are from other countries to become your friend. Sense technology has improved through out the 20th centuries people argue that technology has caused limitations on human contact but that is far from being right. People have been brought closer thanks to the invention of the internet and it wouldnt have happened if technology wasnt improved. The internet has opened a whole new world of opportunities and awesome people to meet. People can laugh at a funny mems together and create groups where their you can talk about what ever you want. People can even ask others if they would like to be friends with you. Having the internet,people become more confident in being their true self. People can see how much fun a family is having and it can persuade them to go and try the place and experience the fun for themselves. With technology people have learned how to do things by watching videos of someone else doing it or by calling a friend. Video games have also has let to people having to talk on the mic and being able to comunicate with each other. People can also build their sense of being a leader as they play a game they can ask people to saty with each other. Thanks to technology people can have online teachers and people who would do online courses say for instance if you didnt learn a lesson you can go online and find a somone who would eplain to you or tell you how to solve a problem. Some may argue,that technology has a negative impact on human contact because it distract others from the real world. How ever,people still have human to human contact its just evolving and becoming something different. In conclusion,technology has had a positive impact over these years and i will keep improving an the people will have better ways to have human contact.

214,214,45291197F292,"I agree I think its a good idea for the students to start a specific career young,because you can be getting early experience to working in a certain field that their future career my require. Its good to choose a career now instead of later because reaching early adulthood with no planned career in mind, because you may have a certain job that you may not like since you didnt plan ahead for your dream career and you be stuck with a 9-5 job. With things like finishing high school and not going into college to further your education for that dream job you want will make your chances of getting the job you want scarce or even impossible. 2. What makes It worse Is, not having the diploma required for that certain job which means you could end up in community college again re-taking class for your job you didnt decide to choose while in high school. 3. And another thing Ive seen Is having one career not work out and a person ends up not having a backup plan for their second career. adding to that some of these careers require years of school some specific schools like law school or going to a school for doctors. I dont agree with choosing a career early in high school, because most high school students dont know what they want to be or they dont have a career in mind at the moment. Students should not be required to take a career path so early, when they have yet to experience their first job or paycheck. and not having any interest in the job offers that are shown to them on the application. Most students are young, and requiring them to have a career plan will end up having them feel like they will be rushed, into doing things like going to career interest fairs choosing what hes interested in and why and talking about with others and what things he or she will need to do. 2. Some high schools care about future jobs they want while most dont so most will not care about their future career and just choose a random career to get started on because they dont know what they like. 3. Some high school students genuinely do not care about school or their own career, so they just drop out mainly because they dont like high school and want to do other ""things"" outside of school adding to that there could be a stress level that is being put on high school kids thinking about the future instead of enjoying the present. so in conclusion students should have their own decision on weather they want to have a career plan now or later.",4,5,7,6,5,5,902,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

217,217,3816B67C0B31,"When working alone, I agree that it is more time saveing and benifical because. You are more focuesd and consentradedon what your are doing. So when working on a job or school profect, you can gain experiance on working alone. You are also more indipendent when working alone, and that is helpfull when gong to colleg or getting your first job. Others can distract you and waist your time when working as a group, and youll end up doing all the work . Ending up with a bad score in your grade. So because of this , people should be able to consetrate on their self , and do their own work alone when the time comes to do so. First of all, working alone can make you more independent .So when you grow up, and leave off to colleg. Your not going to have any body to leach on, so you should be more consentrated on your self then others becouse. No one is going to want help you on your work. So from being independent, you gain that self confidence, and experiance of working alone. From this you are able to do your own choices. That allows you to get a job, or buy stuff that you want. Second of all, when working alone. You gain a better understaning on the sudject insted of others opinons confusing you on what to do. Independent work can make you understand what your doing , and get a good score at the end or a higher paycheck if its a job. Other may distarct or confuse you on what the sibject is your doing. For an example, You might be doing a battery replacement on car. you would read instructions on how to do. then see an example on what to do, but from that point. the instructions is diffrent then what your trainer did. You might be confused on what your about to do, and then mess put at the end. Others may tell you that your doing it the wrong way, and distract on what your doing. SO working alone may save you time, and be more consentrated on replacing the cars battery, and finishing the job. Finally, working alone can make you more focused insted of being distracted by others. You should focus on your own work then copying the same thing as another student. THat student might no bo corect and you are going to end up with the same failure grade as you stident you copyed from. Or when working in groups. Some students may be lazy. Leaving you with no time left, and making you do all the work. Sometimes others may have a different idea on a subject, amking you both fighting over witch one to do. Or some student may be playing around, making lots of sound. making you distracted, and not finishing the work you were supose to do. It is better to work alone because it will help you fous more, and get a good grade at the work you have done. In conclusion, working alone can save your time, and make you independent on making your own choices. It will also give you that confidence of working independent, so you dont have to ask other on what to do. Working alone is just a good skill to have when you go off into your own life adventure. When you are able to do your choices ehter if its good or bad. You are more independent and responsible of doing your own work, and choices of what todo.

My favorite thing to do over there is to help the bakers make bread and also to be with my family. Mexico also has good mexican food that you will probaly like. There are other places i would like to travel to but i choose Mexico because its my moms hometown, theres a lot to do,and because i get to see my grandma,uncles,aunts,and cousins. Mexico is my favorite place to visit because i get to hang out with my old friends and go to the pool and swim til i get tired. When i was little my mom would take me to the zoo a lot with my friends and we would have a blast. Sometimes i wish to live over there cause its an amazing place to be at, but sometimes i dont cause i would have to go to school over there and i would have to learn how to write and read in spanish, which im not very good at. Mexico is kinda similar to virginia because they have chuck a cheese, mcdonalds, burger king , buffalo wild wings, and taco bell. Back then they didnt have those kind of place but only mcdonalds.

Then theres failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that. The one reason I agree is because theres time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will its part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down. The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again thats will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just cant get it. So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm. And I disagree from experience because in my life I fail and never still had enthusiasm after failing maybe some people do but I speak from my point of view.",7,6,6,7,7,6,1631,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

They also will not do their school work because they wont have time to do there homework and they have to go to sleep because they will have school the next day, and they wont get a good grade because they didnt do there homework and there is reason why school board add more time. Why they should not add more time in school because people wont have time to do anything because they will have to do other things too. This is why the should board should not add more time in schools. 1 They have to do there homework. Number 2 they have things to do for after school or they have a plan for after school, Number 3 they have to go somewhere. If the school board add more to the school hours that means that they will have no time for anything. Reason number 1 They have to do there homework,they wont have time to do there homework because they dont have a lot of time because when come back for school they are doing something and the end they dont do there homework,because they have to go to sleep and they need to go to school the next day. Reason number 2,They have to do something or the have plans to do after school. For a example Generic_Name need to pick up his sister and brother form school but he cant because the school board add more time in the school.That is the other reason why the school board add more time to the school.

Also students can use the technology to bully other and to share inappropriate thing for example photos. However, technology distract students to their classes.

There are some reassons that students have to graduate early. Some of the reassons are: they want to finish high school to earn money to go to college, to take some vacations to pass time with family, also if you are a Hispanic person, youre older, and you have resposabilities, you want to get a good job with a high school diploma, if you just want to gradute early, and if you are a great student with all that you need, you can graduate early. The studentss graduation is basic in what they need and want. Some students do hard work one year early to graduate from high school. For example, if a student is 16 years old, and the student is in eleven grade, the student do not have enough credits, or dont have what the student need to graduate, the student is not going to graduate from high school. But also there are students that they have all what they need to gradute and they can graduate early. A low percetage of students have a jod, resposabilities after school, or activities to do. Schools offer many activities that students can do after school, also students stay after school to retake quiz or get help from a teacher. If a student need to graduate early for any reasson, the student need to work hard, and get all what the student need to gradute. Also the student have to do extra work. For example, if the student dont understand any subject, the student have to stay after school, and get help from a teacher to pass the subject and get the credits. One disadvantage that the student can have is that if the students have a job after school, the student can get tired from high school and his/her job. And the student can stop to do what the student need to gradute. The student have to make an effort to graduate early. Some school offer programs that allow high school students to gradute in three years. Some of the programs are in summer, in the evening. Those programs help students to finish high school, its a easy way to get credits in a short period time. The minimum of students are not able to be into theze type of programs. One of the reasson can be that the student work in summer. If the students are not able to be in the programs, they have another opportunity, they can take courses online. In conclusion it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter to college, but have advantage and disadvantages. One advantage are that some school offers programs or students can take courses online, that can help students to graduate. One disadvantage is that, students can get tired, they to do hard work, if they want to gradute early. Students that want to graduate in three years and enter college, some students have a job after school to earn money to college.

224,224,6D21E6095A62,"Many schools are starting to offer online schooling for students. Students or teachers may believe this can be a very beneficial program. However, I believe that online classes can be difficult or tough on a student. Students some times need an actual teacher showing or explaining to them face to face content, others take extra-curricular activities, and many students may even forget they have an online class. First, not every student can learn by just one explanation, many students need a teacher showing them or explaining how to do something. Take for example my cousin, Shes taking online classes but has a difficult time learning the material because she doesnt understand the explanation they are giving her. Her struggles with the material is there because she doesnt have an actual teacher explaining why such ans such are like that. Not many students have the capacity to learn off of the words of a website. Many students need that extra help, whether its a different way of learning or just a better explanation. Secondly, A large amount of students take extra-curricular activities. Many are in an art club, Spanish club, and maybe even drama. The struggles for taking an online class for those would be a large amount. For example, The time I took an online class for art, it was terrible, either I didnt know how to transfer my painting to the computer or I just didnt know how to draw the picture. Extra-curricular activities would be difficult to learn without the extra help of a teacher. Lastly, Students can even forget they have an online class. Many have jobs, others just like to sleep, theyll forget they have a class online and forget to turn in the work. For example my cousin, she sleeps a lot, By the time she wakes up she realizes that her assignment was already due. Online classes dont send out reminders of the assignment so any student can easily forget and fall behind the rest of the class. In conclusion, online schooling isnt very beneficial. I believe that it can be tougher and more difficult on students. Many need a teacher to show them face to face content, some take extra-curricular activities, and majority of the students forget they even have an online class. For those few reasons is why online schooling shouldnt be an option to students. ",8,8,8,8,9,9,1426,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. Theres times where students feel more pressured by an adult so thats what makes them not want to ask for help. Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program. So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other students gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school.

228,228,A79B40F29DCA,"A positive attitude is the key to success in life because it can lead you to having a good job, being well respected by others, having others look up to you, and you should never give up on yourself. Many people have positive attitudes because it can have a good outcome in the long run and help them in their future. Personally I think that having a good attitude can take you far in life. Remaining positive is really the key to accomplishing your goals. I used to be the type of person who wouldnt really have a good attitude because I was usually afraid of what people would say or I would fear that they would disrespect me because I wouldnt have my guard up. Over the years I learned to manage a good attitude no matter what the situation may be because you never know what someone may be going through and you wouldnt want to treat them even worse than what they are going through. I used to work at Chipotle and having that job taught me to have patience and also maintain a good attitude towards other people, even if they didnt deserve to be treated good. The reason I said its taught me to be better is because I experienced a customer who was being really racists, although I didnt want to be respectful and I wanted to lash out I thought to myself that I needed to be the grown person and just try my best to ignore their comments and keep going on with my day because having a negative attitude can result to deeper problems and the outcome wouldnt have been the best. My mom is the person whos always told me to treat others the same way you would like to be treated and ever since ive always kept that in mind and tried my best to remain positive. I try my best to a good role model with positive intentions because I know my younger siblings are looking up to me and I dont want to be the person who fails them. Most jobs would require for you to have a positive attitude because of the way their industry may work. The reasons why they would want someone who has a good attitude is because they have to interact with people, set an example for future employers, and also to satisfy the customers. If your boss were to see what a good worker you are and they see how you manage certain situations they could even give you a raise because they can see the dedication you have for the job. Although at jobs sometimes it can be hard to remain positive because of the situations some customers or even coworkers put you in but I personally think sometimes as individuals we need to put out pride aside and be the bigger person and resolve the issues or just walk away without adding more problems. For some jobs you really have to face hard obstacles and it could get tiring and you would just want to give up but people should always remember that all the hard work youre doing now will be worth it in the end and they would be able to see their accomplishments. Finally, I think school is the hardest place to remain positive because it brings so much stress to certain people that they dont know how to cope with it. I personally expierence this because I am not the best in school and sometimes I just ask myself ""what is the point of doing all this?"". I usually tend to give up when my classes get too stressful for me and I end up failing my class, I try my best to think of the good outcome it will bring me but sometimes I just feel like giving up because I dont think I will be someone big in the world and that is the worst mindset someone can have because as humans we all make mistakes but we should always think that we can better ourselves, if we only think negative then our situations may end up worse. The best way for you to remain positive is to remind yourself the reason why you are doing it and to show appreciation to those who never gave up on you even when you gave up on yourself. I think that I need to remain positive so I can prove to those who doubted me wrong and I can show them that I am capable of doing good even without their help because in the end the only person you truly have is yourself. Most importantly, I need to prove to myself that if I continue being positive then I will graduate and I will accomplish my goals all because I had a positive attitude rather than a negative attitude and bringing myself down. As an example right now I dont think I did good on this essay but im going to be thinking that I tried my best and if anything I could always try again until I get it right. In conclusion as individuals we should always remain positive and keep trying our best because in the end it will all be worth it, even if it takes days, months, or even years. I know sometimes all someone does is think negative and it can put them in a really low place in life but they should always know to never give up. Sometimes life can get too stressful and theres no positive thinking involved but I really hope that everyone can think positive in certain situations and that they can continue to live happily and see that every obstacle they went through will be worth it. To be successful in life you have to keep trying until you get it right and you acknowledge those situations and you have the mindset that you can really accomplish thing if you put your mind and attitude first.",8,8,7,8,7,7,2241,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

230,230,ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses. To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the students desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules. Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time. To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.

231,231,037ED3EA2982,"Do you think positive attitude is the key to success in life. I think it is because if you aint positive you wont get no where in life. Think about it if your positive somethings in life will be easier then other things. I believe theres good karma and bad karma if your positive to people and help people out good stuff will happen to you thats called good karma. but if you bully kids, cuss at elderly and dont help people out karma is going to bite you in the butt. Thats why its always good to be nice to people you dont know even if they arent good to you still be nice because at the end of the day good karma is coming to you. Look at these famous people they made it out of the struggles because they worked hard and they helped people out. Some people dont get chances to show other people they talent if you keep working hard and get your mindset in the right place you will have a chance to make out the struggles. its hard to make it out of struggles some people are working hard busting they butts and they barley get money to pay off the bills. Most likely the people that work hard are the people that have positive attitude not all the people that work hard because some people that work hard are rude and helpless. For the people that are helpless and rude wont get as far from the people that have positive attitude. Positive attitude can get you a lot of good stuff in the future. As long as you stay positive and work hard you will be successful in life. Positive attitude will get you places in the future that you couldnt imagine when you was little. Although its not going to be a easy road to get where you want to be you always got to try. See if your positive in your job and you help people out a lot people are going to start to like you thats one way to be noticed. Id rather work hard with people I know are positive and helpful then working with rude helpless people. Look at the people with negative attitude are they getting anywhere?. They aint getting nowhere with negative attitudes. Usually the people with the negative attitudes are the ones that get bullied, aint raised right, or they just wont listen no matter what you tell them. If they change they life around and start listening and respecting people they will get respect back. If you start switching your life up people will start noticing and they will be happy you. But some people wont change and they will get sent away to prison if they keep up what they do. In the future always remember that positive attitude is the key to success in life. No matter what people say about you always stay positive dont let the negative people take you down because they said a bunch of nonsense about you that wasnt truth. Dont tolerate bullying either if you see someone getting bullied stand up for them having a positive attitude aint only about yourself its about helping people that needs help. Ive seen videos of people sitting down on the bus and not move for a lady that can barley walk it shows you how people are now its pathetic. Id rather help people out and get known for it then get known for not helping out people. ",6,5,6,6,7,6,37,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
232,232,F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frogs interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it didnt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we humans do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasnt a lot of organs in there And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frogs stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didnt made me want to stop either. After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frogs eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frogs eye wasnt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it didnt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself . After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun . Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasnt as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didnt see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project . And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And thats why i think they are the best .

233,233,112AA24D20BC,"Some years ago before my uncle became a doctor, I saw how he was struggling with anxiety attacks of too much studying time at medical school, but he noticed that he needed to do different activities to get distracted a little bit and at the same time get rid of all the stress. Every student participating at least in one extracurricular activity is a really good idea because they could do sports, get in book clubs or help around doing community service. If all the students would do extra activities , theyre lives could be really different and better in many ways with variations of experiences and less stress. Students doing any sports would be really helpful for their health. Mostly every student at school is seating on a chair for hours and at home they are probably just also seating on the couch for more hours . A human body needs to move and do some exercise to have a good health. Sports are really a good ting that makes your body feel or have some changes just like on teens theyre metabolism makes them get taller or develop their bodies. Even if the students do just 20 minutes a day stills helpful for them. Book clubs are something really interesting and fun for students to do. Do you ever just feel like your mind needs a break? Well books are the best option as a break , they take you to many different places around the world even places that dont even exist without moving from anywhere you are at. You can find new adventures, drama, romance and some things you never experienced; just like transferring your mind to another world, and distracting you from your regular life. Making you have and enjoy some good time without going somewhere. In the book clubs you can discuss with people about all those thoughts you have about what you just read, and could also find someone that thinks the exact same things as you. Doing community service not only helps others, it also helps you! You might be asking yourself right now how? Well, helping your community its teaching you as a student how important cooperation is , helping others brings you happiness, and that feeling of how responsible you are becoming. Also, community service helps students a lot with credits for an advanced diploma or even a scholarship for college. If you never have helped your community thinking is nothing fun, you should consider it as a extracurricular activity that you can do. Every student should do an extracurricular activity after schools so theyre body and mind can have an productive break. Any type of activity helps you and relaxs you when need a break.

234,234,D949A947DD92,"Asking one person is great! Maybe asking your best friend for there opinion is great and all, but have you tried asking more then one person? However even though asking your friend is great, but have you thought about what other people may be thinking or there opinions on it? Wanting to ask your friends is nice of you, however they could be lieing to you about there real opinion. Therefor asking more then on person is better then asking just one, and you get honest opinions on what you may have asked about, or what you may have wanted to know about. People think if asking more people for there opinions on what they asked about is better then just asking one person about there opinion. For example, somebody wants to know the best why to make some great yummy cookies. Nevertheless, there may be some times were when you ask people you may get a tie between the two choices, and if you do get a tie just go ask one more person for there opinion. Many people ask more then seven to eight people some people dont have even numbers, however if you do get a even number there can always be more on one side of the vote or opinions. I was drawing in my note book and I finished a drawing, but for some reason I did not know what colors I should use. Then I asked my two sisters my mother and my father for there opinions on what colors I should use. Most of them picked the same colors, but my mother and my two sisters all picked the same color. Therefor, if you ask more then one or two people then you can find out which is the most best out of the two things you wanted opinions on. Even though some times asking more is great you still have to pick which one you like the most if there were to be a tie and you dont want to go ask anymore people for there opinions about the topic if not your fine. Either way the most voted would be best, but if you pick the least liked am pretty sure that other people may not like it. Like my grandma used to say, ""more votes are more points in life"". There are most likely 10% of people who dont ask for others opinions, and 89% of people who go out and ask people for there info about the topic or there opinion about it. Go ask your friends or family if they ever asked more then one person for there opinion. See almost everybody has asked if they havent they well soon. My mother wants to get a tattoo, however she doesnt know which one she should get, and she doesnt want to get something that people or here kids may not like. After she put the pictures of the ones she liked she then put then on Facebook to find out which one people like the most.

I believe that working in group will gives student more ideas and everyone in group can share their thoughts with each other. It also helps students to finish their work on time and the most important is that not only one person have burden to do all work. Communication is the key of working in group because, group working is also helps students to learn how to communicate and how people should behave when they work as a team. Team work and communication is very important to learn before a person go to college or before start working professionally because, if a person does not have ability to work in team then it would be very hard to adjust in college or professional work environment. There are many advantages of working in group for instance, student can plan and share ideas with their group, they can discuss the work with each other before the start work on any project and they can also help each other if any of the group member is confused in anything. The most important part of the any project or any other work is finish on time and if not then no matter how much hard work the person put is just useless. Group working is also save time because everyone work together rather then only one person has burden to complete all work. To conclude, I just want to mention that I understand that working alone is more beneficial for some people but, working in group is much better more easier than working alone.

239,239,EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings. One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes. Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time its going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them dont have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life. The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time. In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",8,6,8,7,6,7,3438,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
240,240,A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity. Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide. Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life. My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college. go to school guys and stay in school.",7,6,8,8,6,6,2144,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

243,243,2BFB0A8F50E1,"Once there was a girl named Generic_Name. She was a great student, always doing her homework, and studies hard. Generic_Name was a negative person, she never aims high on any of her exams because she always have a feeling that she will never pass. At the end of the month Generic_Name get her results back and she passes all her exams. Likewise, the great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies no in setting out aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Some people prefer to aim low and achieve more, while other people prefer to achieve high and achieve more. The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive, have goals, and believe in themselves. The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should be positive. In my life I hate staring new things, whenever I start something new I always think negative and I will not achieve it. At the end, I always achieve what I had started. When I started to think positive on what I am doing, I always end up happy for what I aimed for and achieved. People should be more positive on what theyre aiming for. When people start to think positive they will feel very sure and confident of what theyre aiming for. For this reason, people should not aim too low. Also, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should have a goal on what theyre aiming for. A psychology study have been done on people to test if goals work. The scientist that did the study explained why everyone should have goals, and how having a goal could lead to one do a lot of things. The scientist also explain that a goal is the purpose toward which effort is directed. Having goals to aim for something too high should lead one to achieve a lot of things. For this reason, people should have goals and aim high not low. Additionally, the greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving our mark because people should believe in themselves. In the TV show The Good Doctor, the main character Doctor Generic_Name had a surgery and there was only 20% chance that the patient will die. Generic_Name was a great doctor, but he didnt believe that he could do it. Until the patient was about to die, so Generic_Name had to do the surgery for the patient to live. The surgery went very well, and the patient went home healthy. The main character in this TV show didnt believe that he could do the surgery, and when he had to do the surgery it went well. Likewise, people should aim high and believe in themselves more to achieve what they aimed for. For this reason, people should believe in themselves more. If people aim too low and achieve their mark, then its dangerous than aiming too high and falling short. As the great artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies no in setting out aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low and achieving out mark because people should be more positive on what they are doing, have steps to achieve their goals, and believe more in themselves. Thus, setting our aim too low and achieving our mark is dangerous. ",8,6,8,6,6,7,580,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
244,244,A3C8FABB8B29,"I think is a good, idea that students get different types of classes because that might help to choose their career. Its a really good idea knowing what you going to do with your life once youre done with high school. There are so many teens that once they are out high school they dont know what jobs they want to start and study for it. I think that thats why they should have many more classes that thats what its going to help them continue with their thinking of what career to choose once they gradute high school. for example classes that are for automotive technology is a confortable job in a way that you learn more about cars but in a way is dangerous at the same time because cars have so many heavy parts that could injured you. Another confortable job is being a lowyer lowyers dont do much other than being in the computer or doing paperwork in that cause you dont have to be outside in the cold working on a bad job that involves working in a construction site. And thats the main idea that schools should offer carrer choices that involves students in a carreer class that will teach them once they are out school and that the jobs will interest the students. There is so many students that drop out school because is not interesting to them but thats a bad idea of not going to school because if a student doesnt graduate they will be workingfor some restaurant not earning that much money and working so many hours thats why it is important for teens to stay in school so that the school could offer them on what job they will choose once they graduate high school. School is one of the most important places where they will teach students what decisions they should take on their life once they are adults. In some cases students start going to college once they are out school because they got an idea of how their class works and what for what job they are going to study.",6,7,7,7,7,6,2198,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
245,245,7999A063F80E,"I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people dont usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someones mouth. They wouldnt want to agree with this but, thats because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People dont usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You dont need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day youre the only one who knows what youre accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and dont get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say. Although I think its nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own. So what if they dislike your achievements? so what if they start doubting? prove them wrong with all your accomplishments that are coming your way. Make them regret what they said and go accomplish more.",7,7,6,7,7,7,1595,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
246,246,FF6224AC70C6,"A city council is having arguments to adopt curfew for teenagers,10 P.M on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Some people thinks this to be a good idea,but others especially like young people does not think so. There are conflicting opinions over this topic. According to me this is a good idea to set a limit for teenagers who stay away from home late night. In my opinion,this adoption can lead to improvement in sleeping habits of teenagers,prevents unhealthy food habits and allow teens to spend more time with their families. Curfews to stop teenagers going out of home late night make them improve their sleep time. As they are home they sleep on better time than they are out till midnight. For young people sleep time should be 7-8 hours atleast,because of their growing body structure. Young people are more energetic if they sleep well. Staying out late disturbs bed time for teens,which makes them lazy,tired and inactive in activities going on around us. Unadequate sleep can also lead to risk in driving a vehicle. As you could not sleep well you may feel dizziness while driving a vehicle,which is really dangerous. A lot of teens die in road crashes because of unattentiveness while driving,this unattentiveness comes from unadequate sleep. Also the crashes are caused due to drink and drive habits after staying out late night. To protect teens from death in that early age curfews should be adopted. As when me myself could not sleep well,I am unable to concentrate on my work in my class. This alot of times effects my grades. Also when I stay awake till late night separates me from what is going on in real world because when people around me are awake,I am not focused and asleep. This adoption also somehow effects teens eating habits. Staying out means eating unhealthy and junk food,which is not at all good for young peoples health. Along with adequate sleep we also should be healthy to stay fresh and active. It is really necessary for young people to eat healthy food because they have their full life to live and if they will stay unhealthy,they will get diseases in really early age. Not only food when teens go out with friends they drink alcohol or beer, which is not good for them at that early age. Unhealthy food weakens teens immune system which leads to diseases in quite early ages. Not only diseases unhealthy food collects a lot of fat in their body that effects teens socially,mentally and physically. If teens stay in the house they eat food provided to them by their parents, also which is healthy and not too oily. Whenever I eat unhealthy food it makes me sick and if you are in place where no one knows you,people there likes tyo stay away from me which makes me feel uncomfortable. I have seen a guy in my family who have grown fat after eating a lot of junk food,he suffers a lot of problems like he need someones help to get up if he sits down,a lot of people teases him for his fatty body and also he cannot even walk fast because he gets tired fast. So to stay away from these bad comments and unfit body teens should eat healthy food and home made food. Apart from food and sleep curfew for teenagers make them stay home with their families. This makes them to interact with their families instead of going out with friends. Most of times generation gap is being shown in between families that is just because of less attraction in between people in the families. Having dinner together at night makes you discuss various aspects going on around us. Like when our family get together we talk about of new things we tried,just as me and my sister made new friends as we shifted here this year. Also we talk about how to be aware from diseases going on in recent days. We also discuss about problem we are suffering from. This makes us share our happiness and problems we are going through in our life and also we are able to intract wih the family members. There are various more ideas that shows that this adoption takes teens lives towards positive aspects. Proper sleep,healthy food and interaction with their families can be obtained if this curfews are adopted. To make future generation healthy and concentrated about development and growth of our country these laws are need to be applied. If teens will be healthy they will come up as fresh and present minded citizens towards the country. If they will sleep well,they will work hard to make their dreams come true. Also if they will interact with their families they will make each and every one satisfied in world. Teens should take this in a positive way instead of taking it as a restriction on their freedom. This is not a reastriction but a key to live healthy,fresh and active way of life. Give teens life by restricting their habits instead of giving them dealth with improper lifestyle.",7,7,7,7,5,7,3891,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
247,247,14CC79B9F334,"I agree with Emersons statement because we have always to be like we are all the time. We dont have to pretend be other person just to like someone . For some people be yourself is hard. Sometimes we do things that we never do just to have more friends and that is bad. We dont have to try or pretend be cool or acting different just for that. I think that be yourself is an accomplishment. In the world is a lot of people that you can talk quite freely, but those people sometimes are hypocrite because they are acting like they are people that you can trust. People who sometimes do not look good or something can be better than people who look kind. I am food runner in a restaurant and literally most people loves me in there. I have been working for 6 months in there. All that I have to do is be food runner, but sometimes I help the servers and if I help them is because I wanted. they sometimes say thank you, sometimes they say nothing but I do not care that. and one day one server asked me about why you help them and I said I am just been myself and I like it. I think if one person is good doing something and that person decide to do that all the time, that person can achieve too many things. When I was 9 years old I start to play soccer, and when I turned 10 I tried to enter to the team of my city where I lived, and I could not enter to the team. Some people probably should make a decision to leave everything, but when I see that I could not enter to the team I tried to be better for the next time, and the next year I achieve to enter to the team, and what I think is the importance to be yourself be positive. After play 1 year in the team of my city the next year the coach of the state team talked to me and he said that he was watching me all the time when I was playing, and he said that I am a really good player, and that he wanted me in his team .When I make the decision to go to the new team my friends told me that they are going to miss me. They wrote a letter saying thanks for you friendship and for be an example that all that we have to do is ""to be yourself"" and go for what do we want to do, and I told them that if we do what we want everything is going to be easy and fun. the phrase to be yourself means that we have to be always how we are not change or pretend be other person just for have more friends or something, and if we do something that we like do it.

252,252,3B355996A407,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break should these projects be teachers designed or students designed?. Im taking pocition of this topic, In my opinion students should be have their own projects during the summer, the students already knows, whats the problem is or what they have it trouble with. students involved in summer projects, could be one way to students can learned also students can have more skills if they keep practice with their own projects and ideas they are going to be ready when they coming back to school , Im totally agree with that the students should be designed their projects,For example, Im a student of ESL, I like to make my on projects during summer to dot not forgot what I already learned during the year, in others words students need to work in their on projects during their break The firs reason about this topic, some students, who feel more comfortable making their on projects is that they will know how the topic goes, because they were the ones who created. in fact, If schools let students to make their own projects , they will be more comfortable because they will know what the topic is about and it will be easy for them to make it. Second reason, students needs to make their own projects during summer could be more help for the students , when they came back to schools, because they are not going to forgot it, what they already learned,the students dont have to stop working their own projects because if they stop probably they become lazy. for example ESL students, if they dont try to make their own projects they will be forgot everything. I think that the students, needs to have their own projects during summer, that would be a good for students, also , students, wont forget everything that already leard during the year, because they are still working on their own projects and understanding better their projects, Im totally agree with that the students, can do better without teacher during summer, students can be more active and show more their abilities, if they try they will make it. there are many points to students make their own projects during summer.",6,5,6,5,5,5,766,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity serve a purpose. I agree with the quote by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done can accomplish more. Staying on track can help people focus. Some students from my school today lose track and end up not doing their work. Later on students fell unaccomplished from not doing the work and not accomplish anything. If students can focus and stay on track they can achieve more. By showing effort and working hard people can accomplish more. My mother works hard in the hot sun to accomplish her goals.

My mother works hard just to show us if you do nothing in life you wont accomplish much. People achieve a lot more by getting things done. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo Pushed his team to the max by practicing every day to get things done, as a result from pushing his team and getting things done he lead his team to victory. Getting thing done is reaching for accomplishment and later on be an achievement. Although some people may say that inactivity severs a purpose, the real point to consider is that doing something can accomplish much more by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done will lead to accomplishing more.

254,254,4A9DB943D7D5,"My enjoyable educational activity I chose was soccer because it is a sport you do a lot of running. Soccer can be played all over the world. Long time ago people used to say that all sports were for men only but today men and women play sports thanks to the changing of the laws. A day before a soccer game, players have to train so hard in order to win. They have to learn new tricks and they have to run a lot. All soccer players must have enough energy to run because it can lead to mistakes and can cause the team to lose. Soccer players need to be concentrating on the ball at all times and they have to make sure where they kick because if they kick too hard, they can hit someone in the stadium. During a game, there has been so many injuries due to running so fast and tripping players and then it causes a huge argument over the injured player. At all times if people want to be a soccer player, they have to play clean. There are kids that want to grow up to be the best soccer player and for that they have to start early and join a team in a school or in other places that let kids play. Sometimes kids play at their house with siblings or other people in their family and that can be a good practice for a game in your team. Playing soccer is a great sport and it helps people lose weight because of the amount of running. Some people play soccer for money because they got things to pay, others just play for fun. Some people say that soccer is just for Hispanics, but it isnt true because almost everyone plays soccer no matter the race. In soccer, it is best for your team to have a great coach and that he/she is good at teaching because sometimes its the coachs fault that they lose and he/she starts blaming everyone. Everyone has to try their best in any sport no matter what but its most important to concentrate on the sport and not be thinking about anything else but the sport because you can lose track and make your team lose and your team can be mad at you.",7,7,8,8,7,9,975,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

It will also be the best place youve ever go to in your life. You would want to go to the Bahamas because the beach is crystal clear. You can see all the baby fish that are swimming around you which is so cool! I always try to catch one but it never works. There will also be very colorful snails stuck on the rocks. They look poisonous so I never try to touch them. You can also go surfing there. I am too scared to surf so I just lay down on the surf board and relax. There are coconut trees near the beach which looks really cool. One of my favorite parts is when big boats pass by and big waves come your way. Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because the restraints there are like no other restraints here. The restraints there look big and fancy. The best part is that you get to eat at a restraint for every meal because there is no store there for you to buy food and cook it up. Although that may be a little expensive, but you have to keep in mind that you are on vacation. It takes about ten to fifteen minutes for them to serve your food. I dont know about you, but to me that is not long at all. The food taste so good! They also never over cook your food too! One of my favorite dishes is the shrimp pasta. If you go to the bathroom it is super clean and it smells good too. I hate it when I go in a bathroom that is dirty and smells bad. Another reason why you would want to go to the Bahamas is because of the awesome, clean, and fancy hotels there. The hotels there are nice and refreshing. It is super clean. There are two closets, two beds, and one bathroom which is pretty good if you ask me. There is also a big TV right in front of the two beds. There is also free WiFi for you to use but that is kinda unless when you have a big TV right in front of you unless if you want to play games on your phone which is what I do. There is also a mini fridge for you to put your water so when your hot just grab the icy cold water out of the fridge to drink. The best part is that there is air conditioning and it actually works. These are all the reasons why you should go to the Bahamas. All I am trying to say is that the Bahamas is a great place to visit with your family and friends.

256,256,DF111089EFA4,"We have to work to survive. Employers give us the opportunity to work and to overcome different financial problems. Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. Some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. Schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about Work environment, work skills, and jods requirement The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They suffer to select their jobs. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs. Work environment is very importent. Different people like different work environment. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment. All jobs have some requirments. All the jobs do not have same requirements. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty. In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. It is a great way for the students to build up their future. This opportunities gave students ideas about jobs they should select. The informations help students to be successfull in their career life.",8,7,7,7,6,6,3172,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Im disagree because for me is the same thing that the businesses adopted a four day week that consist of 10 hours of work, because if they work the 6 days at week doing 8 hours at the end is the 40 hours at week same with if you work 10 per day in four days at the week. When the businesses make the people work the 10 hours per day in four days week the people get more tired and most people do workout in the morning or in the night and i think that if you work 10 hours per day you dont going to do your workout because your going to be tired and the only thing your going to do is sleeping If the school follow the same model and extending school day two hours for some student is going to be good but at the time no because if the students come to school for four day and add two more hours they will be in home doing nothing and they can play all day in video games, and that cant get more energy, for other student can be bad because some students work after school and that can affect them. As you read sometimes you get benefits and sometimes disadvantages one of the best benefits can be that you conserve energy and one of the best disadvantages is that your body can be tired, but at the end is going to be the same thing that businesses want four day week that consist of 10 hours per day or that businesses work 8 hours per day and there be the 40 hours at week referent with school they dont have to follow the businesses because students need to learn.

First of all,student will learn more if school board add one and a half hour to their school day. probably student will learn more because their classes will be extended. Also they can get more time in each class,so they can get more information and learn more about each subject. Also they will have the opportunity to do more activity in class. And learn how to work with others. And listen to different opinions and get to a conclusion,For example if some student are good in a activity and others are not that good. They can have the time to work as a group and explained what they are good at and what they need more help, so they all can help each other. They will also have time to work by them self. And passing there SOL. Secondly, student can get more help from teachers. It will benefit all the student in the school, because some student need more help and different subjects. So they can have the time to go to their teachers and get some help. for example some student needs help in Math,English,civic etc. But some student are better in that subjects. So they can used one and a half hour to do another period. In that period student can go to the classes that they need more help. It will be better for some student because each student are different. And learn in a different ways . It does not mean that others are smart. It means that some student learn better in small groups. Some student learn more faster than others. Extending school it will help them get their grades up,By retaking quizzes and test and finish unfinished work. they can get help in homework too because homework is like practice,they can practice what they learn in class and get a better score in quizzes and tests Finally,student can have the time to do more sports. With some of their schoolmates. They can have different sports. For example soccer,basketball,baseball,kickball and more sports..Student can make a vote, for what sports they will like to be in. They can learn new skills and get better by playing that sport. and get more healthy because they are playing a sport. because a big percent of student used a lot of their technology at home and dont do any sports. By extending school it can motive them,by doing some sports with their friends. They can play a lot of sports and see which sport they prefer to play,and see in which sport they are good at. They can do more activity for example Art, photographing for people that like to be creative. In conclusion extending school it will benefit student in different ways. for example getting help from their teacher so they can get better in that subject and get good grades,Getting more time in class,They can get more information. Finally playing sports,they can be healthy and have a hobby that they like to do after all the information that they had learn during the day,some people like to do different activity like Art photographing.

Working in a group has its advantages, and I feel its a better choice. When work work in a group you can see different ideas,learn to work with other and also you can met new people. When you work with other people you can see the different ideas also you can learn know things. You can see the same problem in different ways but as a group you try to find the best way to solve them. For example lets say you have to do a project for a class, and you have to do it in a group. As a group you can share you Knowledge of what you know about the topic and share them with you group . Also you can share you ideas with your group,and see if they like it or maybe they can add something more to your idea to make it a better one . You can see who you have in common with them also you can see the differences you have with you group members . Working as a group can really have a good advantages. If it is a really big project you dint have to do it alone. Also you can split work and everyone can get a small portion of the project. You can also see people creativity. In a group every one is good in something, so lets say if there is some who is really good at drawing and some one really good in writing then the project can look really nice and the penmanship will look great. You can get it done half as fast with every one in the group does what they have to do and work as a team . When you work in a group you can met new people. Maybe you change schools. You do not know any one at your new school. When you work in a group, you can meet new people and make friends. It also work if you are shy because in a group you have to communicate with others to get the work done, or you are just a born leader you can help other how to start the project together or tell people how to do thing because they do not know what to do first. Also it works so you can get out your confer zone and try new things. For example you really like to draw but you do not know how to draw really good maybe some one from your group knows how and they can teach you . As a conclusion I think student do benefit when they are in group. Because not only they can share there different ideas. You learn how to work as a team.

Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life. ""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if weve gotten tired of doing other activities together, weve never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because its a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills. Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I wont have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them.

Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you dont get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldnt do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments.

I agree with statement because having a positive attitude led to great success and great oppurtunity to do something that you would love, or admire. With a positive attitude you could do more in life than a person with a bad attitude. For example, a person with a bad attitude trying to get a job as a model but gets mad over how the clothes looks on them or how the photos of them came out. Getting frustrated, or angry wont led to great success that would just make the sitution worser because modeling is a strict job and they have limited time . They cant deal with bad attitude, so you cant success with that job by being anoyed by something that you disagree on . With a positive attitude you could success with modeling because you dont have problems with nothing ,as least you had an oppurtunity to get the job. Positive attitude led to great success like going to college, getting a good paying job, being respect by others. No one like a disrespecful person by being disrespectful you cant success in life.

268,268,50611B996992,"During this time our society are magnifying in many ways. Therefore, people has to work, study, or do any personal things every day. People dont conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades. To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they dont have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students. Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy. Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student.

271,271,7C6ED140EF65,"There are many that have responsibility in the world that we have to do and with those responsibility there will be many challenges that we as humans have to overcome to theses things in one way or another. A city council is debating adoption of a 10P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers. Dear city council I find it amazing that you are doing this but I also do disagree mainly because. For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night Its mainly because were exhausted at that point we cant focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because were bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now. Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but were actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.",6,7,6,8,7,5,1640,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
272,272,D06EDF336392,"A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble. In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and dont know where their children are can affect them. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents. Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable. In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. that can help teenager to study. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult. Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe. The curfew can assure the best future for the children in our city and United State of America. ",6,6,5,5,5,6,2877,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
273,273,98CD7819C7EF,"Some people believes that making mistakes is how peoples move on to success. Othes believes that is if we are determinated person and having positives thoughts without limitations. Some others people realized right before they are committing the mistake and they are just avoiding them. Although some say, successing in life without failures, our lifes wouldnt make sense, because we would not learn how to be success in our lifes. Actually, successing in life with failures is more baneficial to our lifes, because we learn how to believes on us, and we may have a life without doubts. As a result, if we are the kind of person who doesnt makes any mistakes and realizing to success. i think that we wouldnt know what are we doing wrong to be determinated person. Also most of the people wouldnt have knowlwdge to succes in their lifes. Actually, when people cling to themselves isnt good for their goals in lifes. However, I believe that making failures is how we move on to succe ss in life and is more beneficial to our lifes. Otherwise i can tell the 80% of the people belives that making failures is how we learn to success and we become a civilized person. Sometimes most of the people have goals to achieve in their lifes. As a matter of fact, when we are setting goals to our lifes and we cant get that goal its because we are doing something wrong and we dont even realize whats wrong with it. its when we are learning to be focus and making sure next time to be success and whatever we did wrong. In fact, sometimes its hard to when we have had failures a fewers times, because we do not want to commit mistakes, but i think that is a beneficial for most of the people.

Also I believe that fixing problems is a good way to be success in life. second of all, my suggestions are that to be a positive person, and determinate, smart, and wise person it make us a better person in success. In conclusion, some people believes that having failures is how we are success in life and others dont think that way. However i do believe so that to be a success person, we have to fail a fewers times, because its really important to me to be a determinate person.

274,274,43AE9E4D0EFC,"I would say that I am agree because If you want a succesful life you have to learn how to made your life easy showing to the world that you are special that you can be a nice person does not matter what the other people said or think, you have to take everything with calm and if you have problems you have to solve it with a good attitude because if you get angry you do not going to solve in a good way that is why you have to be a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and the last but not least have a good connection with the people that are around you, you have to put a happy face to everything that comming directtly to you. When you are a good person with all people you made them feel good and also you feel it, because when you are a goood person you are saying that you are different to everybody, because in this world we can see that alot of people are so bad but that does not mean that all of them are aqualsbut ypu do not have to stop being a nice person just because you know people that have a bad attitude, the only thing that you have to do is be away from all of them and give to yourself a chance to know that really think like you that can make you feel as in family, this people will make you feel better because you are showing to them that you can have people around you that can make you have a better life and also more succes, for example I am a good person with all people ,with my family, and with my friends; I am gonna told you something about my friends they are specil I love them and they love me you know why because I took my time to know them, now I know what they like or how they spend their time and the most important they think that I am a succes person that make have a good attitude with them and I want them in my life and I think they will have a a nice life because I see in them that they will be very succes people. I think that have peace is a important part of your life, because from your soul you get a lot of good feelings that make you feel comfortable,but in the same way sometimes you can have something and that make you be incomfrotable but there is you have to try to have peace, I konw that can be so difficult, do not have peace inside of you can affect you in some ways in your life, I think that to feel peace you have to do things that really like you or find something that you can make always and is not bored and also not get angry so easy because just for one problem you can be mad for a weekend or more and that is not good for you there is anything better than have peace, when I was 12 my younger brother did something that do not like me in that timeand I still remember since the first day I can tell you is not good have that mind inside of me, I am 20 now and I think that mind is gonna be with me the my whole life, but I trying to do not remember but when I remember I tell to my self that I love my brother and we are so close and he is a person that is there to hear me and when I talk with with him I tell to him everything thatv is happening in my life I feel peace in my soul. A good connection with people that are around you can help you to have a good attitude because if you meet people that always are positives or always talk about things that are going to help in your life they can influence in your future because they know what they want in their life or what is bad for them those people is nice to meet, are interesting to hear, you can learn somethings from them and you can share some ideas, but in ypur life you will know a lot of people maybe good or maybe bad some of them are going to be nice, they will ask you to go outside a lot of days or they will invate you to have fun and you will think that those people are the good for your to be succes, but let me tell you sometimes the good people are the ones that offert to you not a party if not something that can be good for your life something that is not going to affect your future , and I know sometimes you are going to feel that the people that want to help you are the bad ones but not you are wrong, I know a person that I saw a great future he studied with me, he always had good grades, he always did homeworks, he was a nice guy this happen in the sevent grade, but when we attend the nine grade he start to meet people that they had bad grades they di not do homeworks and I think they don not wanted a future, some months later his grades goes down but was because he always when I ask him where he was, he was going something bad with his new friends and then he turns to one of them , and I think he do not attend college, this is why I am saying to have a successful future you have to be with people that are going to help you in your future. I think we all agree after this three points that were; a good person with everybody, have peace in your soul, and have a good connection with people that are around you, this make me think how important is have a good attitude, show a good attitude to everybody, and have a good attitude does not matter what is happening in your life.",6,5,6,7,5,6,880,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Violence can be make by a bad understanding. Thats why people should seek guidance from experts and learn how to talk to each other. Usually if you are young , sometimes we dont know have to talk and their where problems came from. However I encourage to al young people you seek guidance from experts until they have a better knowing in their decisions. We as humans always make mistakes and we learn through them, but we need help from each other.

276,276,F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So its good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma. First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the Hampton University. Furthermore, students whos want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort. Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you dont have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they dont have any type of help from their families. If students have to work is because they want to enter college. Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he dont have time to his asignments of high school. Some students cant graduate not because they dont want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they dont have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school.

So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students cant graduate not because they dont want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes.

280,280,009BCCC61C2A,"positive attitude is the key to success. I agree because you can do anything as long as you put your mind and soul into it and motivation you can accomplish it. Then so by doing it you feel good about yourself youll feel unstable. But do what brings the best in you, what makes you yourself. One way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself. Then another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude isent quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything theyre just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then theres always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a beatifull flower with of course hard work and it isent in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude. Next reason is to build selfcondifence. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build selfcondience our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the selfcondicence its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle fild the more selfcondidence we will have. So then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the negitive thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore.

281,281,0C7D385D812A,"How should people take decisions?? thats the real question should a person follow a feeling or motion call instincts or should they make a decision by guidance by experts and the laws and authorities. Well a person should use advise really. For example lets say a business man has to make a decision about if he should invest money or not on a product thats been selling good for the last few months but in the pass they werent selling as much. so the business man has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesnt want to make the wrong decision and make the company waste money they wont get back. Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate. Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want. Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer. In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.

This only class they had me with them was the class we had every day to see each other in. They didnt know anyone besides me because we had already met but they didnt know anyone. They were really shy back then but I helped them to make more and new friends besides the ones they already had and me because I was in only one of their classes but not in the others. Then they made new friends in other classes which they are still friends with other people, they introduced me to their new friends and they were really nice and I was really happy for them being friends with new people. We both know that their a really hard worker, they could also be trusted and a special friend. Now, when it comes to us being older we might fade away from each other as time goes by, no one knows when one of us will change or leave but, if we get separated and change I will know its them only by looking into their heart no matter how much they change I will find them again because once a best friend always a best friend.",7,8,7,8,8,7,596,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
283,283,1BA1FD29BF69,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree that the first impressions are the ones that are impossible to change, because impressions from other person can make you feel proud for that person, and impressions from other people about you can just make you feel good and happy for what you are doing, for your hard work. Reason of why the first impressions are impossible to change, is when you find those negative and envy people, that does not want you to be successful in life, and when the time came at your favor and you start to begin success in life, there is when you start to see those good impressions from those negative and envy people, and that just can make you feel happy and proud for the hard work that you did, that is why is almost impossible to change those impressions, because not matter what you showed them you always looked forward, but still dont hate them, love them as God loves everyone in this world. No matter what give good impressions and show them, let them know that they are working hard, people who works hard deserve good impressions, make them feel proud for what they are doing, and also no matter what give good impressions, show people how hard worker, how positive, how respectful person you are, show them that you always look forward not matter what, so when other people talk bad stuffs about you, your ones does not going to believe or change those good impressions from you, because you already showed them that good impressions you keep with you...",5,6,6,6,6,7,363,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

287,287,444D784C5791,"Having the benefit to work alone or in groups is a good thing. Some say that working alone is much better than working in groups because you get no distraction, you also have more advantage to get more work done on time, and get more time to actually think about your answers and not having to worry about someone telling you different, if your wrong or right. When working in a group, you always end up doing all the work yourself or someone else copying the answer from your work becasue they didnt wanna work do their part of the work. Working in groups is not always a bad idea but when you end up doing the work yourself then it is. We sometime wanna work with people we hang out with, but in the end you never get work done. Someone is always doing all the work and thats when everybody copys from that persons work, when they finshed the work. To start off, working alone can cause you less distractions and it would also help you concentrate more on your work. For example, my phone brings down a lot of distraction to me, so therefore I put down my phone for a while and concentrate more on doing my work instread of being distracted on my phone and not getting any work done. Thats why have less distractions and being concentrated more could get you to finsh more work on time. Second of all, you also would get more advantage of getting work done on time. You would take your time to actually do the work instead of guessing or rushing to get done first. For instance, if you were working with a group, you would barely get any work done, but if you work alone you could get more work done than what the group would get done. Lastly, you could actually think about your answers and why you choose that answer choice. For instance, if you were working in a group yall wouldnt talk or think about the answer choice, yall would just guess for every question so yll would be the first ones to be done. When you work alone its different, you take your time, look over your answer choices and double check to see if thats the correct answer. In conclusion, these are the benifits for working alone and not wokring with groups, working alone is so much peaceful and easier then having to work with a group and rush your work and guessing on every question. Having to concentrate therefore less distractions, also having more time to actually get work done and lastly looking over your answer choices carefully.",8,8,7,8,7,8,886,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
288,288,6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how its used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when weve missed an important assignment or other things. The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of its dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school. Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however youd like. This is where a teenagers habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We dont have the right to control how people use their phone and thats where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone. Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just dont suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phones are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices. I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our students with how theyre approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",9,8,9,8,9,9,1319,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

In my opinion, the best way to influence other is talk softly and calm because they can understand more. For example if you scream everyday to them they will not respect you and then will not care anymore. They will be doing the same to other person. Other Person when they talk about they own behavior they get mad because they know what they are doing something bad they get nervous.

So many of students think working as a groups is better will help each other However, teacher will thinks many from us that will improve from talking each other and together. Because the student will do more stuff and talk a lot also as a groups and alone because many student will do that to get focus and pay attention the class. This why that people prefer working with a group is better. Because the reason that we want working as a group is that we will work together and help out the question to talk and give a convince from the work. That we will dont know the answer from the question or the problem because for example, well you think that as a sport you need to be in a group that play together, talk together, and work together as a team is the same thing in the school or other place. For the other example, you saw the cartoon of luney toons that bugs bunny and the duck doing the play for the opera that people will laugh this is call working together as a team to do funny thing in the cartoon shows. So many of student think working alone is better. Because you will achieve more thing be yourself and thinks more hard you never think before from the work. A lots of student and teacher think it will go better that working as a group well it going to be hard that whatever, that i need help or my friend need help we can not work together we only going ask the teacher for help for the question. Because many of student will do more better job in the class to do work and think more stuff outside the place. For example, some singer that work alone because the there want to be alone that make a better song and to do something and plan yourself to leave anywhere you want to see a better life alone. In conclusion some people like working with a groups and other half like working alone because the teacher said if you want work with a group go ahead if not you can work alone. So a lot of student show the teacher you can do both as a same time because it doesnt matter if want work as a group or alone because there will give you plenty of time that to do same thing as a group and alone.

293,293,87692B9A8184,"Have you ever felt that the weekend isnt enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasnt enough. I bet that you did it, and Im going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends. Those who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. They think that weekends arent enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time. One reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldnt pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. As example of this is myself. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldnt be able to keep my grades high and I wouldnt pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed. Another reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. So, he pays rent, his cell-phone payment and food. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldnt be able to have a job after school. Therefore my school should not change its schedule of having five days of school. Based on the reason that I gave, its clearly to see that having four-day school week offers good benefits that the regular standard weed of five-day does not give, but I strongly believe that the five-day school week is way better then the four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a new kind of schedule that some business are implementing called four-day work week that consists of extending the school day two hours. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. ",8,6,6,6,6,8,1788,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

298,298,2FE31DD4FD98,"Personalty, I disagree that my school should follow the model by extending the school day with two hours. The school would have more disadvantages that benefits. My point of view this issue is that school decision might affect students schedule, students health and the school will create a unneeded investment that can create also a problem on parents income. My first opinion concerning the fact why my school should not follow this model, it is the reason that would create pressure on students schedule. Most of the schools have sports teem or music band. Some teenager are included in a teem or a bad, they would need time after school to practice their passion. Taking away that time by adding two extra hours, the students will be under the pressure and will have to choose the school instead of the activities that they love. The two extra hours might create a disorientation for students schedule and students mind . The role of students is to learn and be prepared for the future, to put pressure on a young person will give a wrong perspective of the life. Even if in the future some students would possibly have a career that include a four-days work, the school should not be like a job. Cutting one day of a student schedule would create more homework and they would be suppose to learn by themselves. If the students would be tied or they will need to do other activities, most of the student would rather prefer to stay home than go to school. For example, in Romania, the Music schools had Friday off and two hours added for the rest of school days. For most of the students was a hard period. Being at an artistic school has already harder, students played four instruments and they tried to keep their grades up. Most of the students decided leave the school after the decision of expanding the school day was approved. However after three month the school went back to normal schedule, but the school lost a lot of students. The second reason that I support my opinions have reference to students health. Spending a long time in the same place, students might cause eating disorder, physical and psychical pain. For a young student that have homework or other activities, would be harder to have a clear mind everyday at school. Sitting almost all day it might develops back problems and others problems. Spend more than seven hours at school students might create a sensible body. However, a young human being should not have problems with their body. Eating disorder can be a really big problem for students, in this days most of the young people prefers unhealthy food. At schools many of the young scholars are picky, they would prefer to skip lunch or just eat snacks and other unhealthy food. The lunch is the important meal of the day, and it happened to be at school. Students will need to eat better and the school will need to add more time at lunch . My last reason why I degree with extending the school day it is the fact that school create unneeded investment and the parents budget will have to suffer. Even if the school have the purpose to conserve the energy and resources, adding the extra hours would be the same as a normal five days of school. The school would not conserve the energy, in fact would create a uncomfortable situation for students. School would need to invest more in a healthier food for give the protein that a young student need. For the students that dont have a free lunch or reduced price for lunch, the parents or the guardian of the teenager will be force to pay more for their children to eat at cafeteria, and also the parents will add some extra snack or food. With all my reasons , my opinion is that my school or other shouldnt follow this model and extending the school hours. Some people said that is a good idea to create the opportunity of a free day ,that help students to spend more time with family. However I think the school should give the opportunity for students to feel comfortable and not to be under the pressure of the time.

299,299,610FA0016255,"Self-esteem doesnt come from praise or achievement, In my opinion both of those are only ""supporters"" to recognize the person effort, all of about self steem really comes from ourselves, our thoughts, ideas and efforts weve done. Self-esteem is what to make you be,what you transmit, act or just to look like, thats why is really important to have that present beacuse evryone should have self-esteem. Some people believe in praising a students to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention. Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while theyre doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldnt do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has. First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they dont, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they dont. In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us whats to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, well not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because wed already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove were good on something, its completetly wrong, you dont have to get an achievement to prove youre good on something you like it or enjoy to do. The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because youre waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself. Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every humanve had self-esteem issues at least once and thats alright. I think we shouldnt depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, weve to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, thats where self-esteem comes from.",7,6,5,6,6,6,1264,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
300,300,B04F96DEDE6B,"Once someone told me,"" Focus on your goals, and keep focusing until you reach them, it does not matter if it takes long, at the end of the day it will worth it "". I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take. One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time, which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition. But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best. Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything. In any career, you have to know about everything, even if it is a little bit, but you will learn new interesting things every days, things that you did not know before, and your interest in those things will drive you to search more about it and make you feel that you wanna know more and more about anything you are learning. All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school. In conclution, I think all students should have an idea of what career they wanna take, by the time they enter high school , so their courses of study in high school can help them when they are ready to go to the University, to not be difficult learn about it.",6,6,5,6,7,6,2375,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
301,301,3CACE02FBD5C,"There is a debate about if do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society. The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy. Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy. Now in our society good and hard working people is almost are scarcity because now some people the work in some countries the people doe not want to work they prefer be in their home doing nothing. But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community. There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.

Most of the people decides to choose their own character traits, this is due to how their parents treated them and how their childhood was, all thought it is different when someone has had a rough childhood and yet they decide to be a good person, this, this is being different to decide to be different then the person that has caused pain or sorrow to someone, that is moving on for the best, moving on for what is right; on the other hand we have people who do not agree with this, if there is a good side to something there also has to be a negative side is the balance of the universe and the bad side, or the people that can not move forward let the influences of many others affect their point of view of all the situations upon them.

So why did this British politician Lubbock said ""your character will be what yourself choose to make it"" because everyone has their own personality and everyone faces their own challenges along with their own problems, men can not be like women because men will get denigrated for it, and women are always free to do what they want because they will judge everyone that is against them.

I think schools should follow these businesses model by extending the school day two hours and adopt a four-day school week. Although the students might hate the hour extensions, they would love to have a four-day school week. However, there are a lot of benefits and disadvantages in this model. Lots of students would agree to having a four-day school week. There are a lot of benefits for students if they only have to come for school for four days. Students would have extra time to finish their homework, they would also get some more time to spend with their family, and would be able to travel for an extra day. Students could get a lot of things done with that extra day they get off if they only have a four-day school week. Even though the model comes with lots of benefits there are also lots of disadvantage with it as well. Students might not like having to stay in school for an extra two hours. This is a huge disadvantage because some students have after school jobs they might not be able to attend if school hours got extended. Other students might have to take care of their families after school. Extending school hours would be a disadvantage to everyone because it will most likely mess up schedules. If school hours got extended students might not be able to find jobs that work with their schedules. The school should think about having a four-day school week but shouldnt extend the school day two hours. The model has its ups and downs, advantages and disadvantages but its still a good model. Students would love to only be in school for four days. They would probably hate having to stay for extra two hours so the school shouldnt do that.

Walt disney was fired for a newspaper because he lacked creativity. Learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistake at least you know not to do it again. A failure might put an end to one thing (idea or opportunity) but lead you to other for example: I used to try to draw realistic people and animals with pensils, and then I found that i was better at zentangle (an art style that consists of repetitive designs and patterns. The success you end up having might not be the kind you originally had in mind. Failures could lead you into in something else entirely. Failure often leads to problem, working to solve problems and getting through difficult times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures, you will be more prepared and experienced in the fututre. Strength, intelligente, problem solving skills, and experience are all thing that are gained from faiture and can lead to success. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that success consists of going from faiture to faiture without loss of enthusiasm.

Faiture is unavoidable, but it can be a useful tool that helps shape your future.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on peoples lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media. However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

323,323,A22EECAB91E9,"I support that schools should follow the same model as the business model who have adopted a four day work week to conserve energy and resources, energy, and extending the school day two hours, this kind of model could make them feel better to attempt to class, and start taking action about conserving energy and and think about our future there could be a day when our energy and resource comes to a end for humanity if we dont take actions. However they should considered that energy and resources benefits us and the world, we mostly need energy in everything to survive and resources its a natural source of wealth or revenue that enhances the quality of human life, if businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resource for their future, my school should follow this model because i think schools are the most who spend and waste energy and resource by their thousands of students that attempt there. With a four-day school week , student would at least get rid of depression which adds unnecessary stress, they will have a one break day to do their homework and assignments without staying up all night just to finish it, at the same time it will benefit the environment by just having a four day school week , it will be harder for them to adapt for a longer days of school and a shorter week of school, some of them will not adapt to it but still it would help them to be more time at home with their family instead of be at school stressing. Whatever, If parents and students got the benefit of having a day off, parent will have the time that they didnt have before with their kids they will more hours of work and school but still it may help them to have a better connections, and at least they would have a day off stressing and worrying about their work and assignments. In Conclusion, cutting one day out of school would be helpful for young teenagers who are studying and working at the same time to help their families, and it would conserve much energy and resource than before, making our environment greater by conserving energy and resource in only four days of work for adults and four days of school for teenagers who attempt to any school.

My first reason why i think that community parks or state parks are the best is because everyone can go to them. You and your friends can go and just have a blast. Theres so much stuff to do like play sports with other people .You can even meet new people that you dont even know. Because not everyone that is there your gonna know because everyone can go. For example the Generic_City park that place is so fun you can play sports with you family and buy stuff like food,clothes and other stuff. my second reason is that you can have family time. Family time is so important to me because your family is always going to be there for you and the park is a great place to spent time with them. You can meet up with your family at the park. And also you can have a small little birthday party and just have fun there with your family. If you have little sibling they are going to love it because theres a park and kids love the park and the adults can be talking like your aunt with your mom. And also i fell like being outside with your family is better because you just get to look at the trees and nature instead of being inside. my last reason is if your stress, i been stress before and i feel like the best places to go are the parks because you just can forget about everything and just draw or write. And if your stress you can do so much things like yoga and after cumming things. The park can also help people in different ways like they can be relaxing .And also if your going throw something i feel like being outside is the best thing because if your inside your only going to get worse. So the park can help in different ways like stress. In conclusion the reasons why the community parks or the state parks are enjoyable or people might find them enjoyable is because everyone can go to them, family time and If your stress. And you can do more fun stuff not just this. I love to go to the community parks because i get to spent time together with my family and we just have a good time. And also it helps me in so many ways going to the park like if i stress or just having a bad day. Thats why i feel like community parks are enjoyable and a great place to go and just have fun the next time you go. Do you like community parks?

So to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you soemthing else is the greatest acomplishment. for example If you just been yourself and you making all that you want, a lot of people they not wanna like that so they wanna try to make you fall, so if you been in a world that is constantly trying to make you else is always wanna be the greastest acomplishment. if you are in a world that people like you only for been yourself it is good becasue you just been yourself you can make anything happen and if you have a world that is constantly trying to make something else is the best acomplishment because everything is wanna be more easy for you sometimes you have to choose decision and i think just been yourself you always can taje the right ones",5,5,6,5,5,4,1249,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

327,327,44B06B4A6D7E,"Schools offer distant learning as an option for students who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit students, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunitys with friends or teachers like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you cant get the same help you need on the work. Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunitys as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help students with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive.

328,328,1300AD075785,"Based on what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I would have to say that i agree with his statement because as a high school student i like to go beyond on what i already know what to do. Emerson wants yous to take another step in what we do he wants us to grow wont you? knowing that we are capable of doing something so much bigger and better and just be able to grow in are generation. Success is something that every6 high school student wants to do we want to get better at something, we want to pass are classes and if we are not willing to go beyond and put forth effort then i dont think we will be able to grow. High school is a great way to show this especially if your a student athlete; lets say that you play baseball or softball or any other type of sport that takes time to master. Playing a sport is not easy especially if you want to get a scholarship. I get ask this question all the time ""have you yet mastered being a Cather and going beyond that point to see what you have in stored?"" I have mastered the skills of a softball catcher but i know if i go beyond that point and keep practicing i know that i will be a great softball player in my years to come. Believing in your self to do something can also help you grow, just being able to say I got this and giving it all you got just gets you a step closer to becoming a master and growing into it. Another this is mistake those are alright , no one is perfect everyone is going to have there flaws and thats ok thats another way of growing and learning; wont you want to go beyond something you already mastered and try something new to grow? Emerson wanted us to read this quote and think about what it meant to us. I ready this quote and it gets me to think "" so if i go beyond on my catching and try something else i could grow into the sport and play multiple positions on the field instead of just one."" I could also say the same thing about JROTC in my school as being part of the drill team and going to competitions. These are good examples on what we can all think about going beyond d and farther in what we already know an think about what we can do better so we can grow and learn from are mistakes. High school is a great place to start not even then you can start when ever you want just make sure you know what you want to do and just have fun and enjoy your life. The quote can also be for adults, who have already mastered in something like for example my father, he created his own software and designed it for offices and he is out of town right now in Generic_City so that he can install it and, just grow from that experience he is going beyond on what he dose at work and just making something great happen. The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ,""unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" if you go this prompte and you read it and you have to pick if you agreed or disagree what would you pick? what would you tell me to make me agree or disagree with you?

Why is giving a lesson to elementary schools important ?

When giving a lesson to a class can be difficult and all that, but it can also be fun to teach them some cool things they should know about and teach them easy work so they can understand the work faster and so they can see what level or understatement they are at, kids that go to elementary school can be way easier and faster to teach because upper grade level can get hard and exhausted, cause of there beavers and they way they love to act in front of other people which, they shouldnt be acting like that.

Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves.

I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch. Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that its disgusting.

Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids dont eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school. When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woudnt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she didnt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I wouldnt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that wouldnt eat in school. I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren dont eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coudnt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve. In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.

337,337,589CEB00ED37,"Why is having a good behavior when trying to influence or per swaying others? Lets see humans have a brain with that they have emotions, habits, and other cool stuff in the brain. You see people have to talk with one and each other if they dont they will slowing go insane. Some people may say ""why bring up the brain"" you see the brain is what controls your thoughts or emotions of someone or something. Lets see If someone was feeling down after a persons family pass way, you will try to influence him to move on, but to do that you have to talk to him with a calming voice so can he will feel more relaxed and calm. Why did his mood change? because the person that helped the other person knew by speaking calmly to his friend that he would always have him by his side. If you talk to him with a mean tone, he will get aggressive with you, he would start attacking for not caring about his lose. Because you chose a behavior that didnt fit with the situation, you just made him more mad and now he wouldnt trust you with anything. When at war and you feel like the enemy side is going to run over you, the commander of the army will say a speech to light up the mood of his soldiers by telling them ""this wouldnt be the end but a new beginning of the war, if we die, we die for our country and for our families."" The commander influence the soldiers that the war is not over yet its just the beginning and if they die, they die for a reason to protect the innocents back home. why did the commander bring up their families? As a person would you want to see your wife, sons, or daughters suffer from people whos wants to hurt them. It gives the soldiers a boost and a reason to fight to protect the people they love. The commander influence them to fight to protect their love ones. World War 2, Germany has lost everything money, land, and people. So a dictator name Adolf told to himself that the Americans and the Jews were the problem. Adolf when to a social club and told the people in that club that he was mad at the Americans for taking everything from them and that they should fight to get their land back. The people in the club agreed with Adolf that they should fight. So you see now how Adolf influence the people in Germany by his anger at America. He had a group of German people to fight against his side and over through the president of Germany. The best way to influence someone is by that persons behaviors towards them. If you have some disagreements a law, you will try to influence people to agree with you that this law doesnt seem fair. Influence people at your job for better working conditions or more time in your breaks, and what would be your behavior angry because you feel like you are not being treated fairly like the higher ups. The persons behavior will define the influence you make on them, it could good or bad it just depends on what behavior you choose. Every single person in this world has an opinion and view points on this world and when they feel like something is fair or not fair, they would share their opinions with other people and they would choose their tone to per sway other to follow them. To influence others you have to have the same behavior as the people you are trying to influence or it wouldnt work as well if you have the same behavior.

The first reason I think that schools must have an after school homework club is because students who are having difficulty in class can get extra help form their teachers and students. One time I had trouble understanding how to answer the questions my teacher gave to me about the civil war 2 years ago, and my teacher said that I could stay after school in the homework club and to meet her their.

The second reason why I think that schools must have a after school homework club is so students could improve their grades in their classes. One time I had a D in my science class because I needed more help with remembering the parts of a cell. My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell. One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test. This is the second reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

341,341,E13F3C0CB738,"Can failure lead to success? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Many people who have dreams and goals would agree. If failure is on the road to success it will give motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have experience. Failure doesnt always have to be a bad thing. Failure will give people that push of motivation many need. If students fail once then they know they have to get up and keep trying. Are many people just going to give up because they failed one time? Lets say somebody is setting a high goal and fail; if that person sets a high goal they will have to understand failure will come in some part of that; it is a reach to get there. As soon as failure kicks in, so should the motivation. If not then nobody will be able to meet the goal of success they want. For example,student is walking into class and spent the whole night studying for this test. She turns it in and thinks she did well. Turns out that it is the opposite. She has the chance to retake it and is taking the chance. Sometimes expectations dont go the way people would like. That doesnt mean eventually the expectation wont get met. It just means to keep trying. Another reason on why failure can bring success is because it gives thought of improvement. Everyone knows the saying ""You learn from your mistakes"". That saying is very true. If something goes wrong because the way it was dealt with, will the same mistake happen again? Of course not! People see when the mess up or fail after it happens and will try to do better. That is improvement and its leading you to success. Then we will know where to start and where to fix things. Its apart of succeeding. People who have succeeded can tell others than without at least one fail, they would not of made it to where they are now. Last but not least, it gives you experience. If we didnt fail there would be no experience for the next goal. Having that experience of failure will help. When the goal is met and finally succeeded then there will be an amazing story to tell. Especially because failure was around. Speak on the obstacles that were faced and how to get through without giving up. Having this experience and speaking about it can influence others as well. Maybe some people also have failed but they want to give up, encourage others that failing doesnt mean you still cant succeed. To conclude, failure can be a big step to success if used the right way. Dont sit there and give up because failing is a way closer to the goal. Use failure as motivation, thought of improvement, and an opportunity to have an experience. In this case, failure is a great thing. ",6,7,7,8,7,6,3219,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
342,342,5A9C20C851FD,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldnt be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldnt attend they might be sleep, and they wouldnt care about the online classes. The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students dont get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so thats why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path. Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students dont has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldnt attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldnt learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesnt have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes. Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they dont want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesnt work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldnt have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school. I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldnt attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesnt have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesnt have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, thats one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit. In conclusion, however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldnt attend to the distance learning, because that wouldnt be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldnt learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach. I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldnt be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them. Many students will prefer to take the distance learning just because they dont want to wake up early and go to school.",7,7,6,6,5,7,1170,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end, that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports. First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home. Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure, materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school. Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health. Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",6,6,6,6,6,6,847,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Partnership is easier, because if the business doesnt work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, Its as hard as touching the clouds.

Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness. Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and its the most important thing in a partnership business. A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and No one takes the risk alone. Schools should have the qualities to help the students success in their future life. ",5,6,8,7,6,7,1322,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
347,347,C825937F3BF1,"Students committing to a career at a young age can actually be very helpful. Although, some students prefer not to be committed to a specific career in their high school years. Some students just like to take their time and explore new things and that way it can give them ideas about what to do in the future. Other students just decide what to do when they are in college. That being said, committed at young age, exploring new things, deciding in college. Students being committed at a young age is helpful and will benefit themselves for the future. Students sticking to one area for their career at a young age and just being focused on it is what they need in order to get there. Especially if they are focusing and putting hard work at a young age. However, some students may not enjoy having to just stick with one area. Students will not be able to enjoy what other students enjoy. Exploring new things at the young age is very fun. With students being committed at a young age and all, exploring new things at a young age is very fun. Students do not have to worry or stress about being committed to just one thing. Students exploring at a young age will have more opportunities to see what they like. Students will enjoy more of their time rather than other students who are committed to one thing. Unless if students really love to what they are committed to, they wont enjoy much of their time. For example, if one student is committed to one thing but does not love what he is doing and the other student who is exploring new things and enjoying his time, then the student exploring will enjoy more of his time and be happy as well. Being committed at a young age, exploring new things are fun but Lastly, students decide what to do as they enter college. Students deciding as they head to college is pretty tough. Some students wont be able to prepare for whats coming. For example, if students had chose what to do while they were in high school then they would have time to prepare for what they would be doing in college. But choosing what to do as you head in to college can be tough for some students. In conclusion, being committed at a young age is good and beneficial for students but it can get boring and sad, unless if students truly love what they are doing. Students entering college and immediately deciding what to do without actually knowing anything about what they chose is not so fun. Now students who explore new things at a young age is what most students should do. This way they know what they will enjoy and what they wont enjoy. Students can do whatever they want to at a young age. Once students find what they love. They can stick to it and have it as their career.

The object is give information to the reader about different things that make that the first impresions change, and how can affect. The text is made with examples and support ideas, that help to understand more the theme. Then tell that the impressions can change anytime. The first impresions is when you current know at someone or something. It is the first opinion that you mind create, but this impresions or idea can change when you start to know better. When we current know a person, our mind create a idea that can be false or true, but is something that only can know with the time. The change can affect or can benefit, that means that sometimes we thinks that is good and bad, thinks that is bad and is good. A example of affect is when we buy a car, and these is look like beautiful for autside, but when a mechanical check inside descover that have many damage. A example of benefit is when somebody told you something bad of other person, and when you talk with that person you descover that is false. The first impresions can change for many reasons that our mind create; for example, false opinion, dissapointment, angry, or autocorrection. All these can have influence when you change your impresions of someone or something. For example, when we are angry all is look like bad or annoying. Other example, when we make a autocorrection of something that we believed that was bad or incorrect. In my conclusion the firt impresions its very important, no always going to be good or bad, your opinion going to change.

349,349,34E4FB64EEBA,"Dont you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around? Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? Im nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, Im afraid that my family or my friends judge me. I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. Im agree with the Idea that he have about the world. People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example: You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same. When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they dont let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful. Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else. We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesnt make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want. There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion dont affect and it shouldnt have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we dont want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality. We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and thats why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

350,350,7D519DA76B29,"The use of technology has spread all over the world. Everyone uses technology to talk to family/friends, text family/friends, pay bills online, shop online, etc. To me technology has both positive and negative effects. The positive effect is talking to people you cant see everyday or cant see at all, you can use technology to talk to long distance. A negative effect is the lack of getting stuff done, going outside for fresh air, no person to person communication, etc. Instead of going outside to be with friends, family, etc most people stay home and just be on there phone all day, watching TV, on the computer, any device people have at home they use. Shopping has changed dramatically. Instead of going to the mall to go shopping most people can just stay home and go online to shop. Paying for bills or going to your bank has changed dramatically. You can pay all your bills, funds, credits, online. Everyone used to get out of there house and go to where they need to go to pay there stuff off, but technology as made it easier for people to stay home an do stuff online. Half the people in the world think technology is not okay and should be gone. Young kids having technology is even worse because, kids dont play outside anymore they stay inside and play video games, talk to there friends online, watch videos, etc. Teens are the same too. Almost every teen stays home and talk to friends, play video games like x box, PlayStation, etc. In schools teachers use websites to help students learn and understanding the subject. Technology has changed the world. Technology does allow people to complete many tasks without talking to people. The world would have been so different if there was no technology made at all. Everyone would be outside more with there friends/family, traveling is the best way to get your mind off stuff and to have fun, eating in restaurants with people you love is the best. Ways to plan stuff out like traveling or eating with friends/family is either using a phone or just talking about it in person. In conclusion, i think the limitation of human contact has a negative effect. Since technology has been made people have been getting lazy and lazy by the day. Theirs so much things we used to go outside for, we can just stay home and go online. Instead of playing with friends outside we stay home and play video games and if were bored we stay home and just find something in our device to entertain us.

When students go to business trip with the school They are discovering where they want to work in the future. This allow students explore where they want to work. If they wanted to work at a place that they dream of working then they are going to explore the things where they wanted to work at. I would like to explore more real estate because I want to flip flop houses so I want to learn more about this and I want the manager of the business pick us so we can learn how those a work. One reason, That you should pick us is how do you know if the house is good to flip and know if you going to make more money. People think that you should look in area that are growing and get house that are bad and flip the house so you can sell it for more and get more money then you payed the house and the things that made the house better. Second reason, the manager should pick our class so we can learn How does the business work like how many house do you need to buy so that the work proceed and process. I heard that people buy three house each 6 mouth so they can work on it because some houses take one month and other houses take 4 month. Then you got to wait for the houses to sell that can take weeks or even months to sell the house to get the money. third reason, That the manager should pick us that we want to know that if the wait of getting the money is worth it by waiting to the house to can be ready and wait so the house can get sold. People I heard that money that you wait six mouth is worth it because the money that the person get back is like more twenty thousand more on the house that you can buy a better house in a better place or keep some money. The money that you get can make a lot. That why the manager of the real state business should pick us to visit and learn about the work because students want to learn more about this job and have question more so in the future that students will know about more then the job and maybe in there life working in this area so they can make money to. In conclusion schools should have more partnership companies that students can visit and learn about the work and that can help the students pick there job . and that can help students know what they want to do in life and proceed there dream of working and knowing what to do.

352,352,D9018539576D,"Technology has had the biggest impact on human interaction. Most people might say its made a positive impact on peoples lives while others may disagree and say its had a negative impact on peoples lives. There may be some pros and there may be some cons to this situation. Can the impact of technology be a good or bad outcome? Lets start off with the pros or the positive effects technology has had on peoples lives, now technology has made peoples lives easier. Some may say because its easier to access what they need easier online instead of heading to the market. Some may also say its easier and faster to call your friends or parents, any family member really, instead of driving all the way to them, which is true. Watching movies on your phone instead of going all the way to the movie theater and pay for your ticket and it only being a one time thing. There are countless positives outcomes of how technology has increased over the years. The technology nowadays makes everything faster and easier on peoples lives. Unfortunately, all these great, glamorous, fast, and easy ways have some downfall to them. Now, technology definitely has its flaws and negative impacts on peoples lives. Most can say theres not as much human interactions since technology has been brought upon people. Communication is key when interacting with one another. Today most people are also glued to their cellular device, not physically but you get the point. Especially teenagers, they have a bad habit of not being able to put down their cellphone. Whether that being during school hours, at home when youre supposed to be doing work, and maybe even at work. The generation we have today is usually all about social media, and just being on their cellphone in general 24/7. Point blank theres just no physical, verbal communication anymore between one another. It may be causing a lot of students to slack in school, and it may not only go for students and teenagers, theyre not the only victims. Some particular parents may be also glued to their cellphone just as teenagers. Its not their fault nor do the teenagers have any fault in this. All this is because of the evolution of technology. Its not pleasant to live in a world with not so much communication and everyone being constantly glued to their cellphone nor is it pleasant to do awful in school because you cant put your cellular device down. Now, these are just some reasons and examples why technology has a negative impact on peoples lives. Can you imagine how many more scenarios like this happen daily? Though technology has evolved drastically through out the years and is still evolving now as we speak, theres always going going to be positive and negative impacts. Technology does help and allow people to complete tasks without having contact with others. Theres the problem right there, theres no communication. Even though there are some positive effects of technology that doesnt change the fact that there are more negative effects than positive. Technology effects each person a different way, whether that being in a positive way or whether that being in a negative way. Its all a mix, and by mix I refer to positive effects and negative effects all over the place. Some people may disagree or may agree whether its a bad mixture or a good mixture. Cell phones and all technology can make it easier or harder for certain people. Whether if it truly is a positive or negative impact it will not change what people think or at what position theyre in. Some people just like taking the easy way out and not cope with what they are losing and missing out on, communication. Human communication and interactions are not it anymore. Everyones opinion and saying on this dilemma is different, peoples mindsets are different even their actions are different from everyone elses,but this is my opinion. In conclusion, that is why I strongly, and genuinely believe technology has a negative effect on peoples lives.

358,358,A72A4397F9F5,"Does the success consist of going through failure? Yes, I am agree with this quote. As we all know been successful is not easy. Some people say that hard things make hard soldiers; Therefore, failure is part of the success, but that does not make it easy for us; Why? Because no one likes the idea of suffer in order to be successful in life. As a matter of facts; Failure help us to become who we really want to be or who we are suppose to be, but no all of us get the chance to feel successful or not even see any progress; yet some people choose to give up, instead of fight for a better life; A life with success. But do we loss enthusiasm during our way to success? yes we do! It is OK to loss enthusiasm in our way to success; that is showing every body else, and you as well that we are humans, and we can get tire sometimes; But what is not OK is to give up, because you will showing everybody that you are weak. By showing us how difficult life can get, and tough us that you are the only one who choose to continue or to give up in your life; Oprah Winfred would be a great overcoming example. Oprah had suffer a lot since she was a child; yet she decided to continue with her life. Even though it was not easy to act like nothing happened, but she knew what king of person she wanted to be. Therefore, she decided to fight for those things she always wanted; instead of been crying all her life. Do not doubt that the sky is the limit even for the suffering. Oprah was a determinate woman; a woman who wanted to be successful. Yet everybody else was saying that she would not be able to accomplish what she wanted; instead of supporting her they were feeling sorry for her, and not doing anything. Therefore, she became more stronger than she had ever been, and now she is showing as that even after everything she has been through you can smile with placer and success. On the other hand we have immigrants; those people who fight day by day to get no even what they want, but what they need. As an immigrant; success is the biggest word we all are working to accomplish, some people do not even believe they can accomplish more than what they have accomplished already; Even though everything we have accomplished until this day is because of failure; because each morning we decided to go out a fight to get something else than just failure. Eugenio Dervez is an example of overcoming in a different country, language, and culture. He is an inspire person for immigrant people in the USA. Eugenio has been proving us that dreams can come true. He showed us that everything is possible, you just need to believe in yourself, and trust that you are capable of so much more. Even though some people could be selfish even in your own family; Instead of been worry about others opinion worry about your future; so one day you can be successful, too. Finally, in my experience I have fail so many times; but I am sure that any of those times I have fail will not stop me from what I want to do or who I want to be. Somehow my family does not have faith in me; and even though that if I fail I have no one to support me; I am afraid. However I know that I am capable of so much more, and I will fight until the end of this. Also, I always wanted to show everyone that they were wrong about me that I am capable as everyone else. Yet everybody was judging me, I decided to teach myself how do become a better version of me. I will continue fighting for myself. As you should do! In conclusion, in order to success we have to go from failure to failure. As I was said before; there are so many people that have been showing us that everything is possible. Instead of been afraid for our mistakes we need to learn from them, so we can success in our life. Therefore, we have to think about the future that we want and start working on it, so we can be the people we want to be; the people our parents want us to be.

Its also a good thing for people that have to stay home to look at after their sick parents or little brothers they wont have to worry at school if they are okay because they will be home taking classes and making sure everything is okay while studying. Therefore they wont be overwhelmed about missing days or which classes he needs to make up a test or if he/she has a project coming up in class because all of that info is going to be in his/her phone or laptop. Its a better thing to have online classes doesnt take up half of your day you dont get overwhelmed with new info for like 4 different classes in one day. So you wont be stressed out as much that (study shows most kids that drop out is because they are being stressed out with so many info in just one day for like 4 different blocks in a single day). Online classes are better from what i heard it helps you better cause it teaches you what the state wants you to know instead of things you dont need to know like some side stories that teachers say to make you try to remember but end up getting lost in the story. Finally when you do your work no one can bother you about the answer or what problem you in and they cant cheat off of you and you end up getting in trouble because they didnt stop asking or taking to you. Its also a good thing because if you dont understand you can go back a lesson to relearn it again in case you forgot how to do the problem. thats why Online classes are more proffered then actual class when you have to wake up early and go to school all tired cause you only slept a little staying up because of work or studding for the next unit so you cant fall behind or re doing a new untie while going into a new one. So i support the idea of distance learning for students and that schools are thinking about doing it would be a great idea.",7,6,6,7,8,6,3535,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

361,361,E770240CAEE1,"The first impression that is impossible to change,is surpise. Because in the life always we learn somenthing new,for example,when I start in the first job and dont know anything, I need to learn the things that,I need to do rigth. One example,when I work in the kitchen,so I need to learn the ingredients,the plate name and how to make. After that I can start. Then, I want to change the work,because I tired of the chefs,fire,bad manager or bad pay, and I can look for another job. Now I start again,because I take a different job like a Secretary. Now I to learn new things,because I not work with food again, now I start with papers, computers and minister calls. So this is the Surprise,the life change all the time,but we need to have positive attitude and face up to all the bad things that coming. Is the same with the school, some times the attitude change,because is impossible that somebody knows all the information about one class or two. We have differents impressions impossible to change. Because some people hate some class, for example math, but some liked. Normally I hate this class, because is just number,equations,square rules. I disagree with this class, but I know that in the future I need. But all we have differents positions, because some people love the numbers and others love another class for example, I like History why. The reason is that I like learn new things that I dont know, is very interesting. But, I agree with one thing, all the class are very important for my life, because in the future I can take any job because I know differents things for differents carrers and I can help to other people in any class. We are agree in one thing. Wherever we going always the school is very important in our life. I know that we can disagree in differents things,but I think that is impossible to change the scary impression why, because always we scary to fail but, I agree that we can fight for change the future and achieve everything that we want.",5,5,6,7,4,5,3344,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

We have other people helping us in different ways. For example, we can teach them different ways on doing things they dont feel comforable and that they would feel conforable if they keep doing it. Although it may take time to get use to it they would have experience at the end. Also those people can teach other people. Learning new stuffs is hard but if its a good idea people should do it. I think we can make a difference by learning new things in our lifes. For example, if there were new ways by playing video games then people should learn it. Although it can get people mad if they lose or anything else. It can be helpful to others in the world. I think they would know a lot more if they did. We would get a lot done quicker if we had a method on it. For example, other people helping out on big protects to make it happen and work every well. Although it would need a lot of taking to one each other. It can help by not getting to one an other. Getting to know new people by doing things. If your not doing things you wont get anything accomplish in life. For example, if you dont do well in school that can effect your life by getting a job. People can stop being lazy and do their work.

363,363,80C0814AF16D,"Dear, Dr. Generic_Name Thank you for reading my letter. I hope it finds you well. I am currently a junior at Generic_School. I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school. First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I dont start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students wont know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and thats how I would like to express myself through my career. Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didnt start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didnt start at a young age, if I started at school then there wont be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I dont have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career. Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and thats my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age. Thank you for taking the time to read through my thoughts about career chooses that means so much to me and thank you again.

364,364,B4CBDAF1161C,"Although some people say that classes such of art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves, actually some say that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area and in a short future they will be contributing to the culture of the nation. Often people comment about the classes that students are taking on school. They are agree that art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves. As every person in this country we must let them take part of their own decisions. Let me remain you, when you were young there is a bunch of classes that you didnt like to take, you complaint a lot. Its the same with this classes. Students must decide what they want to do in order of their own benefit. Many students dont even care about those class and their grades look affected because schools required them to take those classes. People suggest that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area. For instance we are in at school!. we are connected to other schools we can make events and build good relations between students in order to let them gain experience. as soccer, basketball, baseball, and football also we can create competitions to motivate them. the kingdom university during 3 years asked to 100000 people "" How do they feel about competitions"" and the 90% of people said, competitions motivate you, is not matter what kind of competitions the human nature always wants to win. In other to this some schools are more likely to invest money on those areas. Culture is a good reason why students should be required to take art, music, and dramas classes. When we talk about culture we have to do mention that it does a huge contribution in the society. for example Tourism, some research showed that the 70% of people who travel to another countries just to know how their culture works. like in years before the music had been changing. The United States of America have long history in music like Jazz, Rock, Heavy Metal and so on. Thats why music classes should be required for students to maintain the culture of music in our country. When we talk about art everyone has heard about the famous Leonardo da Vinci and his picture of the Mona Lisa. Outside there is good amount of artist who became famous because they impressed the world with fantastic pictures. drama, our world is a age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a really good home, cars, and many facilities to live. Thats why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this. Some say classes as art, music and drama should be electives for students because the own decision is important but classes such art, music and drama must be required because it give the students the opportunity to gain experience in those areas and contribute to the culture of our society and nation.

Also, if they do one of those classes they can recive credits on their GPA. First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else. Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play insterment like giutar, flut and many more. So, student can also impress them with insterment. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage. Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. For example, students can impress their family with their amzaning talent. Also, with their talent they can go to different countriesand perform their and other places too and preform too. In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes. imrove with their talents and go around the world.

Most students know what they wanna do when they get to highschool so its a good idea to commit to a career that you are interested in and enjoy so you can start preparing for a job/career in that field of study. Yes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue. Highschool offers many electives and academy classes that students should take advantage of to stay ahead of the game in what they wanna do as a career. Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career. Secondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Most students dont take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Another reason is that if youre confident in what you wanna do youll be able to achieve your goal. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career. Lastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. It could also help out with expenses and anything else. The earlier the better and more opportunitys would be opened to students. In conclusion, students should commit to a career sometime in highschool just so they can start preparing and builidng up confidence in what they wanna do.

372,372,B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isnt a great idea. The reason why I think it isnt a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school. First reason why I think it isnt a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didnt have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isnt enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed. Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, its the only time a student doesnt have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college. Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast. In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isnt a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

373,373,BD9FE34E4670,"I agree with this statement, because one theres no knowledge without imagination, secondly Albert Einstein has made many inventions and he has succeeded, and lastly you can be creative with your imagination. one reason, is there is no knowledge without imagination, because your have to be open minded about things. Imagination isnt just a picture in your head. knowledge is something to see, and think about. its not hard to use your imagination its fun, because you can think about anything you want. even if you have to write a essay, then you need to use your imagination as well. Many people invent things, but before they make it they think about what they want to make, and they imagine what what they want. People invented cars, motorcycles, bikes, and skateboards, But before they made all those things they drew it out they took there imagination, and put it on a peace of paper. My second reason is Albert Einstein invented many things he might of failed on some, but he succeeded on many. He said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he made that statement because he used it to make his creations great. It helped him on many things. and it can help us too. For example if your are writing something, you have to use your imagination on it. If you are listening to music, then you are using your imagination as well. Albert Einstein was a very smart man. he had made many things in life, and we use it till now. Even if your thinking about something then your using your imagination too. People had made phones all different types of phones, People have made flip phones, iPhone, and androids they all invented that, and used there minds and creativity to make all that. My last reason is to be creative with your imagination, I chose this because if your making a book you need to let the reader think, and picture the scene in there mind, or if your reading a book then you have to imagine it in your head instead of just reading it, and doing nothing. Also if your teacher is explaining things to you, then you have to think about what shes saying, and think about what your going to do. for example I once had to make a assay for my teacher, and it was about life bellow water it was pretty hard, and I had to explain what was going on in the ocean. It took a while to make, but I ended up saying that people keep throwing trash in the in the ocean can you imagine how many animals, and creatures are dying every day because of that? I imagined all of it, and people should not throw trash in the ocean. Every time I read a book I saw it all in my head, and it was cool, and fun! Also every time I wanted to draw something, I would have to see it in my head, and see what I should draw.

And that will make your life so much easier. You should should never wait for tomorrow to do something if you can do it today. Also, you cant be idle for the rest of your life. You cant be successful if youre just going to idle. To be soemthing in life you have to work hard for it. You always have to push yourself to the max limit. But at the end itll all be worth it. I remember my mom always used to tell me that ""Never wait for tomorrow to do something that you can do today."" And that will be in my head for the rest of my life. I use that quote to motivate myself when Im doing homework or going to the gym etc. It always works and i will always live to that. My whole family lives to that qutoe. The world would be such a better place if people didnt idle. If people were determined to work hard for themselves, everybody in the world would be succesful.

375,375,28FF89DC3B40,"Have you ever had some tell you that you have to play a sport or get involved with clubs or an activity? Would you agree or disagree to participate in any activity in school? I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family. My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved. There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates. My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did. But in the other hand there are kid that only see their parents once cause they come from work very late and go to work very early and you have to go to sleep cause there is school the next day. It would be very dad to not even see your parents or talk to them or even give them a huge or say i love you. And your dont get to do though stuff cause you are at school doing sports or in a club. This is why i disagree that student should have to participant in an activity. There are so many stuff that student might have to do out of school that makes them not be able to join a club,sport or any other activity that they offer in the school.

376,376,0B953049AE1E,"Some school districts offer programs that allow allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think students should be offered the opportunity to graduate in three years so they can go to college or join the work force early. A program that offers you three years of high school has so many benefits and advantages. Its a great option, because who doesnt want to be done with high school one year early and come out ready to pursue their career or dream? Its not only about finishing school early, but in that year you also have the advantage to be offered jobs or be hired over somebody else for example, if you were competing for a job in fixing computers you would have the more experience, knowledge, and advanced while the other guy just came out of high school and is new to the work force. This program gives you the option to have a flexible schedule and to choose whats best for your comfort. Taking courses over the summer and not being able to take electives can help you finish more early and to be available to plans for the future. You will have so much time to invest in activities that your interested or visit colleges you wish to go to, because remember your graduating early and you have to be ready for this life changing experience.

Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school. Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when youre at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While youre in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if youre taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes dont like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if youre at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning. Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, youre putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention. Also students can have more time to work and can be actively speaking with our teachers too, for questinos and answers to help students.

Ill work hard to get the job and Ill do my best to understand the work that you all do. It may took some time, but it will be worth it. I am not a lazy worker, I am a fast leaner. I have done some other type of job, and Ive done good because I dont just ask them to hire me, I ask them to hire me because I really want the job and work with them. However, sometimes people just dont like to hire people that doesnt have any experience with the job and they dont hire them or just ask them to leave, or they just tell them that they are not worth it to waste their time. Nowadays , people work where they can get accepted because other jobs would not accepted them and they do the to get at least the money to pay their rent and some other stuff. They dont think about what they are going to do if they keep working for hours and getting paid less, but if people would like to work for less hours and getting paid more, they would try to find a job where they can do their job for less hours and for more money. What I am trying to say is that I would like to be hire to this job, because I would work harder to be manager. I am qualify to this job even though I dont have any experience. Trying to work hard for a job is something that life teach you and could be worth it for me, and for my future. I could have a better life if I work harder, I would be prepare for any type of thing to do in this job. I may be ready for any type of things to do in this job. Although, in may took some time to be able to work well, doing other type of job is kind of hard because people are used to work in different type of job and it is kind of hard because we cannot get used to work in this type of job in just one day and it is hard, but people could try, even me I would try to get used to this job and i will work hard enough to be manager. Even though, people may think that it is easy to do a job and get used to it fast, but it not true it is hard to get used to it to other job when you were doing other job. Some people are so cold heart and would not care about your feeling and would just try to make you quit the job and it is not right. If that happens to me I would not let it slide, because I would like to do my job in peace and with no interruption. It right for people to seek a better job position, even though if you are starting to do it, but it is normal for people to seek a better position: just like me a seek for better position in the job. However people would not let you in peace, they would try to make you quit, but if you dont let them be like that to you they would get tired of doing that to you and they would see how much you are getting better and with a better position. I would love to see people that hate me to see me grow in the job that I would do if they hire me, I am not going to be a lazy guy in the job I would work harder to get to manager and later on I would do more and so much more to be an owner of my own business.

383,383,DCB1A6F255A8,"Technology is something many people use in their daily lives, I belive technology has definintly made an imppact on people over time. Phones, cell phones, laptops, tvs have all been upgrated during the past couple of years, technology can effect us in both negative and positive ways but i belive that their are more negatives than positives. One reason I belive technology has more of a negative impact is because it causes a lack of communication with friends and with family, I myself have witnessed and expirinced this. Another reason in why it would be negative is the children using technology. Children can become more obsesed with electronnics than most teenagers and adults, I have a little brother that recived an ipad as a gift from my parents whe he was only three years old, only because he wouldnt let my mother use her cell phone in peace, getting that ipad might have been the biggest mistake thats my parents could have made. My little brother (when he recived the Ipad) stopped playing with his toys, stopped watching his favorite show which was spongbob, stopped eating as much and also stopped listening to direction and became rebelious. Everytime one of the members in my family would try to talk to him it would be like he was zonned out; he just would not listen. Another negative impact this was would be that my little brother would yell when someone tried taking his Ipad away and thats when my parents knew it was a very huge problem, so they decided to put his Ipad away for a while as well as our electronics or atleast keep them out of his sight and over time I got my little brother back and my parents got their son back. Secondly, technology can distract people in many negative ways, one way is safey, you could be walking, driving, on a boat it does not matter, but if youre on your phone and not aware of your surrounding, or not paying mind to them, than you could get hurt. Their have been many reports on people getting in car accident or getting hit all because they were not paying attention, but overall their have been more incidents while driving. There are some ways that technology has also been benefial to us. Some ways that technology has been beneficial is if you work in a job that requires you to have a computer or laptop to make work easier, or having a busy work schedule that you can type into your phone and it would alert you about the things you have to get done. Another benefial way that technology has helped is shopping! eveybody loves shopping but somtimes you cant go out and do some shopping for yourself becuse maybe its been a long week and your exausted from work or youre injured, as well as having children. Children are the worst when it comes to doing things for yourself, which is why there is technology to help you out, you can do online shopping for grocieries, clothing, exc without having to leave the comfort of your own home. In conclusion, technology overall has its ups and down, there are times where it can be beneficial and there are also times where it can be a distraction but it has definetly helped in the past in many ways one really big one is hospitals, technology has saved many lives and helped alot of familys so it really depends how you use technology for it to actually be benefitial. Its not good to take advantage of it, you have to use your brain as much as you can, people depend on technology too much and thats what causes problems.

Basicaly students can complete all their schoolworks and learning process at home through different methods like, in this case, the students attend classes form home by way of online or video cinferencing, but is it really good for the students?. Probably not. It is know that students learn how to be sociable at school, and also they learn how to act at to many different social events or situations in the daily life. For example, we have a group of students, they are all the day working in a classroom with other students and friends that they knew at school; and we have a group of students that take ""school at home "", they do their school work in their houses and they just can socialice with they family at home. How can you learn how to be sociable without socialice with new people? different than your family ?. The answer is: you cant. Talk with new people improve you confidence and helps you to make new friends, and as students or young people, we do not used to try to talk with new people, because we are afraid, we dont have self-confidence, etc. and school force us to be social with our partners. Moreover, some people claim that school is not a good way to improve your social abilities, but that people passed and important point and is that the school is the best way to improve your social abilities. For example, you (as a student) are working from monday to friday at least six hours per day with other students and teachers in different classrooms, the students arent going to be the same in each classroom. All these factors made you get used to different personalities or behaviors of your teachers, friends, and classmates. School have to many different people with different behaviors that can help you to understand the way that people act and how to be their friend. In addition, school teaches you how is going to be your life when you grow up and trains you for that. There are to many similarities between school and a job, for example: the schedule that makes you get use to the early woke ups, the homeworks that make you understand how long can be a job journey, and the teachers and students that represents your boss ans partners at work. All these examples of how school trains us for our future. Without all the training that the schools gave us, it would be a problem to get use to or daily life when we grow up. All these reasons show us that school will benefit students more than ""school at home"" or ""distance learning"", because it teach us how to be sociable, it develops or social abilities, and it is a necessary part of our training for our adult life. In conclusion, school trains us as people, it teach us how to socialice and work.",6,8,8,6,6,7,2407,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

"" Determine never to be idle"" It is not good when you are not doing much work. Dont be un idle. I support my idea with several reasons. First of all, I personally agreed with the Thomas Jefferson wrote. If you use your time properly,time is very important in your life you will be productive day use your time. For example I must be weak up in the morning do my exercise every day. I will be healthy It is very important when you have a good healthy. After that you will be managing your time for the hole day by firshing your time. Then I go on time my school. Because to have a good skill is very important. ""knowledge is a power"" I will get my a good education. Also, I go to my job and make my money in the mean time. For this reasons when use your time that will be a good productive day makes you happy. I heat to be seat and watching TV all day and play game. Second, I am very happy for making some one happier or helping. Because on my extra time I always go to the library and working as a voluntary helper for some people need help. Also, what ever i have information I shard with people and give a good information then make them happier. In addition, I always go with the alimentary school when they have school trip. Helping for the teacher. Especially, working with the kids it is fun and having a good time when i help the kids it make me happy. Third, you will be a successful and accomplish your life.

389,389,15F6B5C6229A,"I will agree with the Emersons statement,but this can depend too the point view. This is one of the example: There is a men who is an entrepreneur and he have a little company,and he decide to make it more big,but he dont know if he is going to do it. If you dont try to do it you will never grow, you have to do new things for you know you will have to try something beyond of you already mastered. The way I understand this is if you dont try to do something that you already know, you will never learn a new things that you dont know,because there is not way to grow if you dont over pass your self or you dont try it and that is going to provoke that you cant advance to grow or even stock in the way you try to make to grow. Example: When I was 15 years old, the only thing I did was just studying. Although when I start to think about my future and then I figure out I have to do more than just studying, I have to choose which college Im going and work to earn money for I can pay my college and expenses I have in my house or personal,because you have to do something for you can over pass your goals or you will never grow. But some people maybe think or have different opinions about this,perhaps people say like its a lie or you cant do it because its impossible and also that is fake. Every one dont thing the same, maybe they a different point to see it,they just dont want or they have a another way to grow. The majority of people are going to say yes,because they already lived the moment that if you want to grow, you have to go beyond of the things you already know or youll never going to trust your self. My opinion is that maybe this wrote of Emerson is true and the reason why im saying this is that you have to do things new and over pass your self ,and doesnt matter if you already mastered something,if you want to grow you have to try it because you cant grow if you dont do different things that you have not idea about how you can grow and make or dominate more things that you cant believe.",5,6,6,6,4,7,298,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
390,390,9152EA0F430B,"This world have many energy and resources, but we have to something to conserve all of them. Some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, to try to conserve energy and resources, but they work ten hours each day thats mean that they still doing the same thing because they are working the same hours weekly. So I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources, should my school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? I would say that my school should not follow this model because students would not have time to do things, students might miss a lot school, and is the same thing is like we come the five days to school. We would not have time to our things because is going to be a long day two hours more, so we are going to be tired we might not want to do our homework. Somethings we have to do our personals things like help at home, or some other stuff that we need to do such as have fun with our family, or do what we like to do as play soccer, play video games, etc. I know that school is more important, but not the majority of the students thing like that. We would have to do all the things over the weekend, we might not spend time with our family because we would been doing homework, or some other stuff like personal things. Also some students only would go home to sleep because like I say we would be tired to much work at school. Even the teachers would not have time to plan what would be the assignment the next day, I know that they need time to plan in what we have to work on the next day, but they have to do things in their house as we the students too they also have homework to do after school. This is going to one problem that I think must happen if this school extend the school day two hours more. We might miss a lot day of school because somethings we have appointments as go to the Doctor, or go to somewhere else also do some important things. some students might decide to not come to school because they have to go the appointment. As we know some students miss a lot school on this day if school extend the day they might miss more day of school because they might say that is too long the day, or if they have a project to do and is a big project (we get out until 5:00PM), so we have to finish in whole night supposing we finish the project until 3:00AM, in the morning we not going to wake up because we are tired, we would miss the day of the school also we would not turn it in the project (It was the only day that we would have to turn it in), so we didnt get the grade for the project. Also teachers would have problem with their children for example if they have their children in a day care id they only work until 5:00PM they have to run to get they children, but if there is traffic, so they would be late. They might have to paid extra money to someone can pick up their children. Even when we come for the five-days per eight hours we have more time to do our thing that we have to do after school. Some people might say that they support to come to school to a four day school week and extend the day two hours because we would have three free days. However, is going to be the same if we come the five days per eight hours because we would come ten hours per day, so ten per four is equal to forty hours for day (this is if we come four-day a week), so eight per five is equal to forty hours (this is if we come the five days per eight hours). We would still using the energy and resources at the same amount as we use to do it now, as we see is the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hour. We need something that help us to conserve energy and resources not something that would give the same amount the we are using now. Finally, I think this is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources because we would use the same amount that were using right now. My school should not follow this model because they have to think that consequences like people would miss a lot of school they might be tired too much work in one day of school to long one day, we would not have time to do our things at home like homework, personal things, and we would not have time to have fun by doing what we like to do as play soccer, or other stuff, and is going to be the same thing if we come to school the five days per eight hours. We have more time to do our homework, to do what we like to do like have fun, and spend time with our family when we come the five days per eight hours. If we really want to conserve energy and resources we have to find something that is going to be successful, not something that would give us the same result.

Research determined that when it comes to group projects people complain and prefer to work independently. Also, why would you want to work with others if you do not know if they are in the same level as you. When working with a group you have to check up on your group members to see if they finished there part of the project, if they are not responsible enough to finish it themselves you have to fill in for them because it is a group project and project grade.

It could be a girl or a boy that theyre interesting on and their first impression may not be how his/her boss want it to be. But if theyre really interesting on that boy or girl who want the job or went to meet them they may give them a second chance to make their really good impression and that man/woman that like or want to obtain or to meet they will work really hard to get what they want ,they will search or obtain imformation on how to be presentable or to act in their interviews or when youre meeting someone you are interesting on. For example,If i want a job that is really flexible and easy and thats my first time getting a job and I am dont no nothing about how to be dress up, how to act infront of your future boss or future or girlfriend/boyfriend and how important is to be o time because its how it works,If youre late to an interview or a place when you will going to meet with that girl/boy they will left or they may not interview you.

When we were walking to go see the Eiffel tower, it didnt seem big, but when we got closer, it seemed huge, I was shocked because I never knew that it was very huge. Then on the top of the Eiffel Tower, the city can be seen. As we were on the top of the Eiffel tower I could not believe that I could see the beautiful view of the lights of the city.

I am agree with this statement because there is not better way to influence others than have a good example by our owm behavior. The change start in us to show a good example of habitat, religion, responsability, respect to others, and over all humility. The first reason is that nowadays the people see and judge of how peple look like, how people are dressed, or if people are old or young, in that way they are giving examples to others to judge the people, instead of give a good impression or example to other that everyone needs to love each other like they love their selves, no matter how they are. Respect other to get respect, always kind with everyone no matter who they are. Helping each other everywhere. Be a good citizenship: Payin your bills, respecting the laws, and be a good neighborhood. Because without examples, no one can make differences. The second reason: Be a kind person, study to have a good future. For example: ""I am in High School I am graduate this year. I am a English learner. When I came here in US I didt know how to speak English, but I came to school, I study hard all the words, and I practiced my English. Now I know the languaje, not at all but I can defend my self. I want to encorage all hispanic people to learn English or let their child to go to school, and I know that is not easy but not impossible. I hope to give a good example for all hispanics. I will keep doing it to influence them to learn the language of this country."" Some people say that there are many ways to influence others like with words and not with actions. However, they are wrong because how people will change without an example of life, like Martin Luther King, he was a great person, and he passed through a lot of things, and everybody knows that he influenced a lot of people in that time and I think that he still influencing more people even that he is not with us anymore. In conclusion, giving example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. encoraging them to learn english, helping each other, loving other no matter their religion. Influencing lifes with actions is better than jsut words. What would happen if no one wants to be an example for other.

399,399,EC7A73638669,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I agree with this position. I believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. Although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have. When people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. If the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. This is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. With enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if its require. Also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed. The time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. Some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they dont will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. The reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. This method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. The children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. For example, I took English 10, in summer school in Generic_City, but I was living in Generic_City, I drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, Im sure that it was the best desicion because Im at few steps of my graduation. People always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts. On the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. The opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. The contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. People that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years. In addition, some parents are not agree with the options that the program give to their children; to take courses during the summer or in the evenings. Parents refer to this like ""a extra pressure to students."" There are people that suggest that the better choice is that the students complete their four years of high school; however, it can prolong that time for students to graduate. To conclude, its important emphasize that in certain cases the pressure is a tool that help people to protrude in their projects and in the life in general. When people take risks and they have the courage to do reality their goals, they going to achieve all of them. The time that people invest in positive accions are transcedent to achieve their goals. The program offer a essential support to students, that going to be useful and it going to show to students that they have the capacity of achive their goals, before that they believed, they just have to establish their academic purposes and demostrate that they have the capacity to achieve it. The program is a great oportunitty to grow and success, one year can be the big difference, and it can approach us closer of that dream.",8,8,8,8,6,7,3453,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be. First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work. The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right. The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because other tell you. Always do may make you happy, no metter if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference. In conclision yes people should follows their instincts and ideas. But also make their own decisions. Never stop doing that things that they like. Always do and follows what they believe and think carfully and what they want and where they want to be. The goods and bads decisiones and experiences and learn of they if what really teach you about lifes important matter and make you succeed.

It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always not doing something productive? No, being inactive wont help accomplish nothing just by standing or laying down at home doing nothing. Although, we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. People would learn more things, meet new people to achieve goals in life and how much can be done if we are always doing something. People would learn more things if they are more productive. I remember when my mom signed me up for a soccer team. I didnt know I was going to be joining a soccer team, or wanted to play on the soccer team;however, I did it and I learn how to kick a soccer ball, how to be a golly and I improved my speed. Another example was when I had a vocabulary test for English but I didnt know half of the vocabulary words, so I study till I learned the words. Meeting new people to achieve a goals. I like being a indoor person, but when soccer season comes and I join a team I interact with new people and coaches to achieve my goals on how to become a better teammate or how I can improve my speed and mentality to become a great soccer player. Another example was when I talked to a new math teacher to help me on a equation I didnt understand. he helped me understand the equation, and helps me every time I need help on something in math now. Imagine how much can be done if we are always doing something. people would be able to accomplish so many goals if we are always doing something instead of staying home and laying down and watch TV all day. when we get some free time we can work on something that would help us in the future and make us think better. Maybe when we think we dont need help, but actually do ask someone to help you to understand more instead of staying with the same mindset. Although, some people maybe dont got that much time to accomplish things. Thats why they go inactive but still accomplish their goal on a long term time. Inactivity also can also serve a purpose, depending on the person maybe they dont got money or a transportation vehicle to get to their destination. Although, they cant just do nothing and wait for something good to happen to them. People can accomplish their goals by always doing something that would helped them in the future.

People would learn more things, meeting new people to achieve a goal and how much can be done if we are always doing something productive.

403,403,9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think its bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they dont want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them. In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people dont go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they dont know who they are. Some of these people might say that theres no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, theres a risk when you talk to this people online and its the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what theyre doing, and thats how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we dont know if its real. When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they dont want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time wont help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didnt have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now dont want to get out where technology is at. Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, its hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them. Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we dont control the use of technology.",7,6,7,6,5,6,2081,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
404,404,A9A152AAFBE1,I would be interested in joining a program that you guys have to offer. I am very interested in automobiles and would want to look for any companies where I could work on vehicles as my career opportunity. Ive always loved the idea that I could one day learn about cars; how a vehicle gets off of the assembly line to the road. There are many companies that are in demand for mechanics to turn wrenches and do not care that they are going to get their hands dirty on the job and for me I would be happy just doing that for a long time. Ever since I was a kid ive worked on my dads and uncles car. By changing their tires and putting the tires back and doing oil changes to tuning and modifying my uncles car from a stock making two-hundred horsepower to eight-hundred horsepower. Ever since ive had experience with vehicles in my life time and working in a companies to get my degree and one day open my shop and be able to work on cars would be a dream come true. When I got older I started reading books about cars from the first ever made vehicle to where you had to crank to start the car to when technology was slowly progressing and that was not a thing anymore. Through out the years technologies have increased dramatically and vehicles are being driven by them selves and I would love to work on self derivable vehicles because I know that I would be able to make it right and make sure that the customer is always the priority and I am always hundred percent and determined to make the vehicle an high functioning machine with so much capabilities. I would love to one day work for Tesla or BMW in making electric to hybrid vehicles and knowing that it would be a fun career option while doing something that I always loved ever since I was a little boy I would be grateful. ,6,6,8,8,7,6,2267,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

406,406,EEEF81C2E133,"I am writing this prompt to inform you about the position for hiring. I would be very delighted if I could be hired by you. I do not have experience at all but, I can show you that I am a good candidate for this job and I could handle the job very well. Here are some few reason why I would be a good candidate for the job. One reason on why you should hire me is that even though I dont have experience I tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. Usually I memorize them very easily. It has a greater impact on me because I learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. Also, I could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers. For example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. It is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. It is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention. Another reason is that I have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. I am a very joyful person and what I feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. For example, I have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and I tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. I think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. My goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy. The restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home. Lastly, I like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. What I love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships. Ive seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. You also make greter connections with your coworkers. For example, If someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. I like bringing bonds together and working with them. These are some of the reason I would love to get the job. I want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. I love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. I also learn very fast and I love being commited to anything and working as a group. I hoppe you consider me to work there and I would be very happy. Thank you for your time. ",6,6,7,6,6,6,3502,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

408,408,F7DF6ABE8573,"I strongly believe that technology is positive on human life because of all the effects it had on us in the past and present. Such as: technological advancements, you can talk to people easier, caused scientific break throughs which made us go further in life, and it also gave us security or protection. The technological advancements are practically everywhere because everything we use is technology. It has helped us with new vehicles that could possibly be more fuel efficient and possible will create more safety in the cars since its easy to hurt someone in a crash. It helped us in school and made us understand things such as looking up answers you dont know or checking when the next test is. It inspires people to think of other ways we can advance our technology state currently. Its really easy to talk to people because it doesnt take that much effort in order to have a conversation. The news is one example because it tells us whats happening even if they are far away from us, we can still hear them. The weather could change into a disaster and they would tell us to evacuate. It allows us to talk to relatives that live in other areas or countries. It could let us see political debates and see whats happening in other areas. Without technology we wouldnt have had any scientific break throughs because it moslty helped us with everything in life. An example of this would be us landing on the moon which is a important day for the people because it showed that we could do really big things. If people did not take the time to study and think about the different scenarios then we would not have those outcomes. It helps us by looking up something we dont understand on the internet and in five seconds you could finally understand whatever you were trying to look up. One thing that makes us feel safe would be your own home but what if someone broke in and had bad intentions. There would be an alarm system that would ring and call the police to indicate that there was a intruder. It gives us security by giving us locks on important things such as banks so no one can enter it unless they knew your password or any other necessity. Technology definitely played a huge role in our daily life and the evidence shows because everything we do involves technology or is something about technology. I strongly believe that technology doesnt stop human interaction but helps builds it up. I think this because we can text friends, text family, work on a project, or do school related stuff with it. If we keep on making up better technology or improve it then I believe it will make discover or invent big things that will push us into the future.",9,9,8,9,9,9,3715,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

Ive seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they dont get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team. Also, when you play soccer you have to think what youre going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills.

It can help you think of new ideas. maybe in an emergency it might help you think faster on what to do. it can also help you develop new ideas. It makes you pick the best choices you have and what to do with them. Playing a sport its going to help you in the future, even if you think its not. Finally, soccer is a fun sport to play, because it helps you run around and exercise. It can help you stay healthy and stay in shape. Nowadays people dont like to play sports. They just be in their house watching TV shows,playing video games, or just doing nothing. People focus too much on the internet that they forget how to play sports and do fun stuff.

Not everyone are good at playing sports and even though they probably know how to play sports they might just be scared to play because they have shyness and people are lazy to do any kind of sports.

Not everyone will do the sports just because the principal told them to do any other sports. People will just ignore the principal They will get mad because if they have low grades they will get kick out of the team just because of the low grades.

Some student will not do what the principal say because its either they dont how to play the sports or they dont wanna play the sports and if they do play sports its because they got force to play the sports because their parents and they dont want their parents to be mad or sad because they do sports.

415,415,BB8064D7B327,"My friend is home schooled because she use to get bullied a lot so she wanted to drop out, she couldnt deal with it anymore. Her counselor gave her a better option taking online classes because she had very good grades and she wanted her to graduate and have a good future. In some schools they offer distant learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think getting home schooled is a good benefit for students who have situations at school, for student drop outs, and its easier and quicker. The primary reason on why its a good benefit, its that it helps you if you have bad situations at school such as you always get into fights with other students, you are getting harassed or bullied, you have problems with your teachers, or you think youre wasting your time and you could be working and getting money. Having online classes can help you stay out of trouble or helps you stop what ever you are dealing with. Not only it stops the situation but can help you improve and graduating with no problem. If you are having problems talk to your counselor and ask for a possibility for online classes or your parents if you can get home schooled. Secondly, it benefits the students who are dropping out of school. Most of the students who are dropping out are for financial reasons like, they want to help there family so, they drop out and start working or some teens get pregnant at a young age and there parents most likely they dont support them or help them in anything that they need so, it causes them to drop out. It helps them further there knowledge and can possibly get a better job. It makes them feel happy knowing they can finish school because they know they already making a decision by dropping out but they can still graduate by taking online classes. I remember when i was at student counseling aide and one day a student came to ask me where should he leave his laptop because he was planning to drop out, he looked upset. Generic_Name ask him why? he answered ""i wanna help my family out they dont have any money right now"" she gave him an option for online classes he didnt know it was possible to do that and It made him happy. Finally, getting home schooled is easier and quicker. You can take your classes when ever you are free. If you need to take a break, you can and continue when ever you are ready. its non-stressful comparing to regular school. Its proven that getting home schooled its less stressful than regular school. Generic_Name is a science teacher at SCHOOL_NAME he said ""88% students are stressed about school because of homework and not having to finish assignments on time"". He also said ""only 5% are stressed when they are home schooled"". In conclusion, its less stressful and help you feel non-pressured while you are taking your online classes. It also, gives you free time and gives you advantage to do what ever you like. You get to be home and relax wake up when ever you like to, do your classes take brakes if you would like to, too me it sounds amazing! Some people might say that getting home schooled is bad because if you have any questions you dont have a teacher to ask or a physical teacher to help you understand the topic you are learning about but its a one on one class. Theres no students just you and your instructor, it helps you focus which i personally think it will help you more comparing sitting in a class room with your friends not paying attention, playing around or not getting work done. I think its a good benefit having online classes because it helps with people who have bad situations at school, people who are planning to drop out and its a fast and easier way to get your classes done.",8,8,7,8,7,7,2526,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
416,416,EEB4D170D513,"Albert Einstein said Imagination impacts more than education on people, I kinda disagree with this statement. In life there many things people want to accomplish something in their future life. Like learning a new instrument, to play sports for a team and others. One thing I would like to do is to stay on top of all my classes for school to be succesful in life. People say its a challenge to stay on top. When I look at it, I say every challenge always has a way to get through it. The reason why I would like to pass all my classes is because I want to use that as a skill in my life. At the end of college, people always wanted to be big things like presidents, surgeons and other important jobs. In real life people who cared less about that, are just sitting in a cubicle just to answer calls for a living, which is not a bad thing. I dont want my life to end up as those people, I want to make a big impact in our everyday society, like Steve Jobs. He made a big impact in peoples lives by releasing a new iPhone model every year, but he didnt just start a company that fast. He needed to be educated and was the smartest kid in his school, all the way to college, he was a smart and cooperative guy until his passing. Thats why I am planning ahead to stay on top of school and college so I can try to make a great impact for people. Instead of trying to stay awake in a boring office with the meanest boss in the world and with a low salary to one meal per week. Another reason why I would like to be successful in my classes is because It made a huge impact on my uncle, Generic_Name. Back in my uncles time, my parents and my uncle lived together in a small town house in Generic_City, he was uneducated. My uncle was an outgoing guy but didnt care about his education back in college, he was always on the couch eating Cheerios and watch Tom and Jerry on the T.V. My parents and I started to convince my uncle to start repeating college, but he didnt care, he just wanted fun in his life and not care about anything education related. That all changed when he realized that he had pay rent and that he wasnt educated, so he finally took the opportunity to repeat college, we were happy for him to do it. He scored high scores in all his tests and was awarded a scholarship for Generic_School and graduated with a high masters degree for law and got a job for jr lawyer. Now, he rose up to make the best lawyer in Generic_City and makes 500,000 thousand dollars a year and lives in a mansion with nice cars and to share all his fortune with his family. This story has inspired me that I should stay on task with all my classes and to plan my future career ahead in time. The final reason why I want be a successful kid in all my academics is because of opportunities, just like my uncle, Generic_Name, He came to the top because of smart he really was in college. Just like my uncle, I want to be like him and to open the door to so many career opportunities in which society has to offer, like Will Smiths movie, The Pursuit Of Happiness which was based on a real story . This talks about some emotional topics about a man named Chris Gardner was not making money and has his son with him to look after. He wasnt able to do his job right by selling bone density scanners and barely enough to pay rent or daycare after his wife left him. He got his life back together by repeating college and moving, but soon he opened the door to so many job opportunities and later in his life became a multi-millionare in 5 weeks. Based of this act, I started to think that anything can be possible as long as you put your mind to it. That way I can open many opportunities in my life. These are the reasons why I want stay on top in all my academics is because I want to change the world the way people see it. I want people to know my name for all the hard work and impact I did, staying on top of classes accomplishes anything, it can make me into a very important person who makes a lot of money, but in order to complete that task. I would need enough Education to make me successful enough to encounter that career opportunity in my life.

418,418,840619A0CF0B,"Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose? The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. We the people shouldnt be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isnt as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you wont stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! thats how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who dont motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;Im writing. An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who dont accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like ""Yes! I did it!""and that way they wont have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media. In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus. For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I dont study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on. Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President. There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you cant depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?.

420,420,5902C2E86345,"Is influencing others other even a good? I believe that there are better ways to influence other than just by your own. One other better way is to look at other people and see how they have seceded in life. Another way is to see ones appearance and how they act. Others think differently and believe that your own behavior the the best to influence others. My first reason why I believe there are better ways to influence other is one will look at other and want to be like them. This will want him or she to start and think on what they want for them selves. Maybe they do not know what they want to be yet when they grow up. So by seeing others and how they have seceded they are going to want to try new things. Looking at others by can also help the influence them by what not to do and learn form others mistakes. This could help them start on the right way. Thats why feel like looking at other can influence others. My second reason is ones appearance cause when someone sees someone they judge off your appearance and how you act. The way someone else looks will want them to be like you if you are dressed with a suit and tie. That is because a person that is dressed sharp or elegant makes you look prfecinal Also seeing others the way they act can influence others to want to act like them. They might see how other act towards them and them probably want other to act the same with him or herself. Others think differently and feel that your own behavior is the best way to influence one another. Some people might believe this because one person could impact one person so much that it will want that other person to do the same. I feel like that not the best way cause its hard for just one person to do so much. I feel like one person can not do as much as many other people can. Therefore,this is why I feel like there are better ways to influence others than your own. Like notice others and see how good they are doing in live and might get inspired. Another is a way one looks to someone or they way they are as a person. Others might think the opposite and say that ones owns actions it the most impact full way on other people. This is why believe that one persons actions is not the best way to influence others.",6,6,5,6,4,6,1149,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

First impressions are the biggest factor in the world we live in right now, because we all want to have a good life, so we have to present our self properly.

422,422,33AF50FB5ED9,"Some schools have an after school homework club where students and teachers help other students with homework. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills. Homework is a staple of school an students hate it, so why not get some help with it. Most students forget about homework and get a bad grade because of it. Why not get help with homework and remember any other home works you have to do. With a few good homework grades they could pass their classes. Students all have different ways of thinking and learning, and why should their learning be all the same. If every student had to go and take part in this club the more introverted students would be more tired out. If the students are tired out they are not going to learn anything and that effects them in a bad way, but the homework club is not mandatory that is why it is not a class that we have to go to every other day. Some students have big dreams, but dont know how to get to them. If someone wants to be an anthropologist, the study of humans, they will need to be smart and brave enough to publish their findings. A homework club can help make trusted bonds and encourage people to talk and speak up for themselves. So many schools have a homework club but not many people know about it and are failing because of it. I think that a homework club would be beneficial to students because it could help with grades, it is not mandatory, and could help with teaching skills.

Imagine in a world that is trying to change you in everyway. Im disagree because you have right to do what you want to do with your life or who you want to be in your life and nobody have to say what you need to do. Example; all people in this world have rights, bacause alot people trying to change your life, and they want you to do what they said, if you think you are right do not lessent to the people. To many time the comunity try to change your descision and they do not respect what you said. thats why is alot problem in the poblation. Example; to much politician people want to change customs and religions they cant do anything about it, because that is a decision from there culture. If you took a decision about to put your own company and your friends say you can not do that, just try to do your best and dont peatention to him. Example; in a company every employer have his own rights like what time they need to be there or what time they get out the work. The reason why i shoose disagree is because to many people in this world do not respect when you make your own decision, if you can do something do not worry about what people say.

425,425,45697CF2448C,"Do you like to extend your school hours? I think extending the school hours do your life more easier because you dont have to do homework at home. You can do your homework in the school and you can ask for help. I agree with extending the school day because I like go to the school and you have more time to stay with your family because you dont have to do your homework. My first reason is I like to extending the school day because when the teachers give you homework you can do it in the class, and I like it because you can have more time to stay with your friends. By this I mean, when I come back to my home I dont have to do any homework because I do my homework in the school and I can go outside and play with my friends. This is why is good to have more hours of school. For example, one day I was in the school, and my science teacher give me so much homework, she told me I need to do projects, quizzes, and extra work but I told her I cant do it because I dont have internet at home and I cant do my homework in the school because I dont have so much time because the school end early. I go to the school principal and I asked him if he can extend the school day because many students need more time to do their homework and then a few week ago he told me,"" I want to expend the school days because I was thinking and you are right."" I feel happy in that moment because I will have more time to do my homework and pass the grade. Conclusion, extending the school hour can help you to do your homework and missing work, and you dont need to do it at home. My second reason is I like to have school hours because you have more time to eat and when you do your testes you can study one hour and not is a matter because you still have time to do your test. By this I mean I have more time to eat my lunch and talk with my friends in the cafeteria, and when I have testes I do it with more calm, and I dont stressful because I have time to do my test. To illustrate, I was in the school, and I was doing my math test and I was so hungry and I asked my teacher if I can ate and he said "" No because we dont have a lot of time, and we need to finish the test."" I was so mad because I was hungry, and we dont have time to ate. When the test finished we go to ate and then we have to go to another class but I was so tired because them dont give us time to rest . To wrap up, you need to have time for everything and do the thing with calm. Is good if the school extend the school hours because you have time for do your homework, your quizzes, or your projects. To wrap up, the school need to extend the school day because like this every student will have time to do what they need to do in their classes, and they dont have to worry about the homework in their houses. I feel if the school extend the hours should be great and more peaceful because you can because you can do your work and other things with more tranquility.

427,427,88816FFD8A5C,"Online Learning Who doesnt want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when theyre in their house, students cant have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home. Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Names text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher. Secondly, taking classes online doesnt just mean you dont have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one. Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You cant always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people arent perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasnt functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone. In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.

Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus. Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example, Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting.

To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home.

429,429,D293D510A140,"Have you ever struggled in school and needed extra help,Well I have struggled in school and i didnt like it so then teacher came up with a great idea to help kid that need extra help with homework or a specific subject the idea was called a homework club. Homework clubs can be useful for kids that cant do there homework at home because they do not have WIFI. Kids can stay after school and be in the homework club if they do not have computers at home to do essays. Homework clubs can also help you get better in a subject like math because you can get more 1 on 1 help with a tutor. Homework clubs can also be used for kids who are in a sport or after school activity the homework club would let you get your homework done quicker in school so that you can go to your after school activity on time. For example if a kid has an F in math and a teacher gives him extra credit work to do and the kid doesnt understand the work the homework club with be there with tutors to help the kid understand and finish his work. I believe that homework clubs would be a great way for kids to learn more about the subject they are studying in class. Sometime dont you feel like your teacher is explaining something too fast and you dont really understand,Well the homework club can help you with that the homework club will get you a tutor to explain to you more about the subject. Have you ever been in class and kids are talking well in the homework club you would have peace and quite so that you could do your work in peace. Have you ever had that one class you couldnt pass well I have,so what i did was go to the homework club were i had teachers and other fellow students helping or teaching me what i didnt know about the subject i was struggling in. The homework club is also a great way to interact with other student. The homework club is a place for learning not for fooling around so if you want to join the homework club it is because you need help with your homework or classwork. Anyone needing help is math science or in any subject should join the homework club. The homework club can help you raise your grade in the class if you try hard and try your best. The home work club is there if you want to get your homework done is school so that when you get home you can relax. The homework club also has lots of benefits because you can learn more than other kids and you can get special attention from your tutors so that you can learn more in class. In conclusion the reason why I want to create a homework club is to help kids that need extra help in class. I also want to help kids who cant do there homework at home because they have no WIFI. I would like to help kid who teacher arent really teaching good so they can have a good grade in that class. I would like to help kids that need special attention to learn. These are all the reasons I think schools should have homework clubs. ",7,7,6,6,7,6,2922,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
430,430,9B4BD1687FA0,"The quote says, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you already mastered, you will never grow."" I disagree with this statement. Because people need extend their studies, so that they can learn new important information that can benefit new research, also they can set new ideas, so they can make new studies and discoveries. Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow. Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather its good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families. Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. Its another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger. In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it. That is why I disagree with this statement, and their is never enough or to good to learn. I will never get tired of learning new fascinating stuff about this world and the outer world.",7,6,8,8,6,7,2062,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
431,431,301A4BFAE56A,"Working in group would be much better, because you will be able to get more help by the other people, like how people in my country say "" 2 brains think more than one "". If you work by yourself it will be hard because you would have to do alot of work by yourself, like if the teacher says that all the students will choose to work with someone or by yourself, because they would make a poster and it has to have drawing, colored, and write some stuff about it, for the one who is doing it alone it would be hard, and for the one that are working in group can meet in any of their houses, while someone is doing the writting the other one would be doing the drawing and colored, so it would be easy for them to do it.

432,432,68256AC96C72,"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age. Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since theyre still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldnt have to worry about what career they want since theyre still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life. In conclusion, i think students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession. Committing to a career can lead to causing mental or emotional stress.",8,8,8,8,7,9,1354,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

435,435,34A066E69905,"There are two types of working. one of them is workinng with a group, another one is working individually. Although some people prefer to work alone. I belive it is so much better to work in a group. If we compare these two working types, the benefits of group work are more then those working alone. Firstly, I prefer to work in a group because group work allow a person to work according to his or her strength, since the the group members apply their strong side to the work, the completion time will be faster. For instance, I was involve in a car desgin project several years ago. one person made engineering calculation to understand which parts are critical for our design, I made the drawings of the car components, and another friend of mine made the presentation for our project, then he present it to the teacher, He gave us a good respond and additional points since we completed our work before the due date. to be more precise, we did a great job, because we devided the work according to our strong sides. Another reason why I prefer to work an a group is that I think that this type of work establishes a stonger relationship between the group members. As humans, sociallzation it important for us and working with a group give us a chance to improve our relationship. when people are in a group, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. for example, in our last year elective course, I made new friends becaude we were involved in a group project together. Thankds to the project, we did build a great relationship among each other, and we are still in touch. lastly, group work improves the sense of responsibility. All group members are aware that their perperformance effects the group, so all group members try to do their best and work hard to get better results. For example, A few years ago, some of my friends and I participated in a competition which was related to optimization. since there was a lot of thing to do, we devide the topics among each other. we did not have enough information about one of the shared parts. however, a person who got that subject made a lot of effort to learn the topic well. He attended online course and read books related to that field. Eventualy, he accomplished it and did a great job. what Im trying to say is that in a group work, even if a person does not have enought information related to his or her working area, he or she may learn things with his or her effort becuse he or she knows that a miskake will cause negative outcomes. In conclusion, working with a gruop makes things more easier and helps make the group member work more happily. If we take the info account to all these factors, we may reach the conclousion that working in a group has more advantages than working alone.",7,7,7,7,7,6,685,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
436,436,FA078892658B,"It is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. If regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after 10 pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically. The first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. For example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. Also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. Furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up. The second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. For example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. Many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. So, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them. The third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. If teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. For example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because hes a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. These curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe. The last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. For example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or herself a job that will allow him or her to work during night hours, keep him or her out of the streets and help him or her economically. Economically means that the person will be working, earning money and also staying out of his or her house during late night hours. Teenagers can improve themselves economically if they spend their time working instead of spending it in the street doing things that will not help them in anyway. Finally, by working and improving their economy teenagers will be able to save some money for their own future and have money available for emergencies that can occur throughout their lives. Furthermore, it is better that these curfews are adopted for the security of teenagers. Also because these regulations will help teens improve themselves economically by keeping them out of the streets and motivating them to find a job if they want to be out of their house during late night hours, they will also help them socially because people will not be avoiding them if they are not seen in the street, medically because they will prevent them from getting into fights and having to go to the hospital and finally academically because teenagers will not be wasting time on the streets and they will have more time to do their homework and improve their grades at school.

438,438,A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades. One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way. When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesnt have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students wont lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and wont stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teachers teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school. There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges dont go to students homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need. Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",8,9,9,8,9,9,2170,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers wont be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low.

Otherwise the teachers wont have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly. Second reason, is that teachers wont be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy.

Bahamas could help me because of its large safe streets some places dont have these types of streets and some do. I could bike throughout the whole city without getting hit by a car. Have you ever asked your self what is it like to live in the Bahamas? I would like to live in the Bahamas but its expensive like every other place some places are less and some places are more because of the food, views, and living. Some people live in the Bahamas even tho its expensive these people might have found a job there that pays well or they were born wealthy. Living on the beach is hard because it is expensive, and dangerous because of the storms and other natural disasters. I choose to live away from the beach because it is safer. The Bahamas have enormous amount of colorful plants and animals that is why I want to visit the Bahamas. In conclusion the Bahamas is one of the most beautiful colorful places in the world with enormous amount of activities, talents, and cultures that is why I want to visit The Bahamas.",7,7,7,6,7,7,909,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
445,445,125C1167A84A,Mrs. Generic_Name i think changing the school menu is a very bad idea because the students will not have many choices of what they wanna eat in the cafeteria. so the student wouldnt get to eat what they like or of their favorite choice what the student usually get when they are in the cafeteria. and the students wouldnt be happy about changing the school menu and most student would go to school and not eat lunch and go home with their stomach empty. so Generic_Name i would not recommend not changing the school menu because. the student would not be very happy at school and if the school menu changes. mostly the student would will bring their own lunch from home and bring it in to the cafeteria and the school lunch food would be wasting . because the students wouldnt eat the school lunch food because majorly the student are bring their own lunch. which its not a very bad idea because students can bring their own lunch and they will not be starving to death with out skipping lunch and going going home with their stomach full instead of empty which it is a good thing. so i think not changing the school menu is a very good idea because friend and i can have free choices of what i like to eat and what the whole school would like to eat or bring the Owen lunch to school which i think it a very good idea because if i had the freedom to to bring my own lunch or choice in the cafeteria. i would eat very well and i wont have an empty stomach the whole entered day in school. and i will not be sleepy for the rest of the day and the few class i have at the end of the day. i think sum of the students will do the same thing as me if we all eat very good and very well in school in the cafeteria and it will be nice. Mrs. Generic_Name i think that most student would not like to have a healthier school lunch menu becuase no student usaly get school lunch in school so the students usaly bring in their own school lunch and which its a very good go idea because the student can bring what they like to eat during lunch time .and if you change the school lunch menu then the student wouldnt get school lunch any more. and if the whole school didnt jget the school lunch any more because they dont like the new school lunch menu. it because no one like to eat very healthy at school and maybe if the whole school didnt get lunch and every single student in Generic_School pack their own lunch with its a bad sin becuse all the food would be wasting . so mrs Generic_Name pelase dont change the school lunch menu becuase most student wouldnt be happy if the school lunch menu changes and every every student in Generic_School would be so happy and glad if you didnt change the school lunch mean. ,4,6,6,6,6,4,249,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 4"
446,446,AF6E7702012F,"Is doing your best a problem? Personally I feel like there is no problem by doing your best. You should always want to do your best no matter what your doing. But,some people dont like to try they give up so easily that they dont want to do nothing no more. Like me I try my best but,sometimes I dont apply myself,and when I dont apply myself it turns out to bad results. For Example,Paul George,and the Clippers played against Los Angeles Lakers,during the middle of the game Pauls shots werent falling so he was having a low scoring game,but he still tried his best to get rebounds and steals to win the game for his team. For another Example Generic_Name had a test,and there were some questions on there that he didnt understand. so he still worked through the problems,and took an educated guess and still tried his best and got a 75 on the test. usually Generic_Name get a B or above on tests but he forgot that the teacher told him that there would be some questions on the test that the class didnt know. Final Example,my little sister is a basketball player like me and every Friday i go to ball handling to get my handles right. My little sister never done it before,and the class that we took was advance,it was easy for me because i been doing it for so long. But,i look to my right and i seen my sister struggling and my Trainer told her she was doing it wrong. So she dropped the ball and walked out the gym. After the training we got home,and i had a talk with her,and i told her i was gonna help her out. I showed her the moves outback and she started to get the hang of it,and now shes been practicing on the moves for weeks,and finally uses them in the game. But, she gave up the first time but, she was willing to try,and the results turned out fine because she tried her best. You should always want to do your best and not give up because if you do your best the turn out would be great. It makes you want to work hard and do better at the things you want to do or get the things that you like. It makes you feel good because you know you tried to give it your all and wouldnt have to stress about it.",7,6,7,5,7,6,2359,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
447,447,D2C9C1EE55F2,"I think that if we always do something we are going to learn something new from our miskes. We have to do something always everywhere in the world even in the bad times of ours life time. For example we have to work, take cares of our childrens and also ours country. As we born and grow up we have the right to work harder at school until we finish than we have to work. we always have to work in untied state because we have a lot of bills every month in the Mali box everyday a bill is coming from different companies, Every month the rent of the house. Than the rent of the cars we drive. And the insurance of the cars. The bills from gas and water so from every where. We work this much money and we pay back more than we make and at the end nothing will left for us. Than we have to take cares of the kids always something new when ever they see something we have to buy it to them no matter what you cant say no we have to work so that we can take cares of them anytime anywhere. Unit they grow up they always asking for milk if the government dont give the families or the kids the snap which is a card they always or each month they sent money into the card so you buy food from it and thats for kids. If they dont help people and the people have to work even at night to prevent every things for their kids. We always have to do something for our country to do our jobs like we have to work hard to protect the people from dying we have to take cares of our jobs better. We have to help the government by paying taxis so they can do something to the country make the roads safer for us so we can drive in a better roads. We always have to do something that the people whos lives in the country proud of us such as the police mans, military and air forces or anything else who ever work they should be honest with their work. That way we can do something for the country. In conclusion we always have time to work its never late if we want work or do something and instead of staying home is better if we work outside.

449,449,E22F1FD54169,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered, You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car, Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back. The conclusion is yes, i disagreed with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" and you need to practice everyday dont matter how good your there is a lot of completion out there and some people dont even know there are so many people better than them which some people dont even know what kind of abilities they got. they need to go to gym and stuff to know hat kind of abilities they better in a moth year or days. and to get their mind working antler and help them to have a good mind and learn how to grow better and teach you guys to learn and thaknyou for grading my essay I love you from heart and have a nice day.

451,451,D42B6354404D,"Dear Principal I think we students should at least have a B average to play sports, that would make it fair for who tries their best in school, but i bet that those who really love sports would try their best in all their classes. Students who do not try their be st and dont like sports they could just stay with whatever grade they get because they deserve it. Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade. If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average. All students have to do is listen in class and pass all the test that teachers give out so you could pass the class and be able to pass your class and youll be able to play what ever sport you want. Students and people who try their best will always get everything they want because they do everything said and everything they tell them to do. doing everything they ask you to do will make you a good person.

The first reason that you can change your first impression is just by giving them another chance that they can change becuase everyone deserves a second change when people mess up their first impressions you should be able to let them change it because even you might of mess up on your first impressions on a buissines meeting or even on a date and you do want them to remember your first impression they want to remember the time you changed your first impression to a better one to show people what you are really like. The second reason is because it can be about a really important meeting and you messed up on your first impressions and the other buissines people would be like ""wow he messed up really bad on his first impressions"" and you want them to give you another chance so you can fix your first impressions so they so they can be like ""wow he really change from the first time he was here"". So give peolpe to change their first impressions. The last reason is that your at your girlfriends house and you are eat with her and her parents and you mess up and the dad says ""his not the type of guy you should be dating"" just because you mess up now the dad does not like you anymore cause you mess up and we you go again you must change that first impressions that you showed them the first time and make it better so the dad doesnt hate anymore.

One, they could get a zero on the test, and a zero on a test will lower the students grade. Second, the student could get sent to the principals office and could get a call home. The students parents will also be upset. They would be in trouble at home and at school. Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesnt know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesnt know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade. Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated.

One night, i decide that its not the time to just give up on yourself, after everything what ive had done. After that night, whenever i thought this to myself. I went every single day to my swimming practice, also thinking thoughts of head to never give up. All this sudden, i became more successful ! i was a leader to my swimming team. My couch knew one day i would put more effort on myself, he always believed in me. Some other days, theres times after swimming club. I just wanted to hang out with my friends, to able make time for them to go shopping, walking down the park,go on the beach or having fun at their parties.

457,457,A5B9C9F26FD6,"Generic_Name Your principal has decided that all students must participate in a least one extracurricular activity. For example, students could participate in sports,work on the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Would Students want to be forced into taking a program, club, or after school activity, no, of course not. Nobody wants to be forced into doing anything in life. Besides if a student was forced to participate in an program what activitys would they have. what if he/she doesnt like sports or working on the year book or etc. How does it benefit the student in any way. Students should have a right to decide whether or not they want to join a club or activity. The reasoning for this is because, if a student does not like any of the programs then it wouldnt be fair if he/she still had to choose one. Thats why its wrong for the principal to make this decision. Imagine a boy who just moved in from a different state. The boy had a lot of amazing, awesome friends that he had to leave behind. Now he has to transferred to the nearest school, having to start anew. His parents gave him the election forms and he has signed up for everything he needs. Only later to realize that it is a requirement to sign up for a ""extracurricular activity."" Although the boy does not want to sign up for an activity because he does not know anyone. Now put yourself in that students shoes how would you feel in his situation. Most Students just want to get through the day, get home and relax. However, by adding this system the principal is adding a whole other level of stress for these students. I mean who would want to be forced into working on the yearbook or playing soccer yea absolutely no one. Students want to be free. Except with a required activity they have a whole other class to worry about and making sure that class has good grades especially if that student dislikes being there. It needs to be a choice whether or not a student wants to select a ""extracurricular activity"". I can see a probable reason the principal made this choice. I assume it is because the principal does not want there to be empty clubs/programs and that makes sense but it isnt fair to the students who do not want to be apart of any activities. Now it would make sense if the principal had a democrative system where the school voted for this option but thats not the case in however that is what the principal should do and the principal should ask the school to vote to get rid of the requirement or keep this way this can give the students, the principal and staff more reassurance. If the principal did do this then a huge weight is lifted off their shoulders. Jumping to my next conclusion if a extra activity is required then this can cause stress and anxiety for students who dont want to be there. This can cause of lack of thinking process, failure in grades and bad attitude. Let me explain. myself for example. If I was in a extra elective and I was forced to be in and i didnt like it I would start to stress then my grades in that class would start to fail, then slowly my grades in other classes would also fail. Now my parents would start to be disappointed in me and i would start building up anxiety. That anxiety if built up enough would most likely lead to depression and worse case scenario suicidal thoughts. So in conclusion it is a bad idea to require a extracurricular activity. Instead of forcing it i would heavily recommend choosing a activity because you never know how someone feels about certain things.",6,7,7,7,8,7,2223,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

I know many people that would love to have a better career, but they dont have it because they dont have experience and they give up easily, because they feel that they are not ready. commit to a carer at a young age it make us to to more professional. Some people say that commit to a career at a young age is not a good idea, because they are to young and they dont know what they want, and Also they are going say, that commit to a career at a young age will ex tress the student and that student are not going to have time for there friends, they would argue that identify a career at a young age is not good idea, because student at a young age are not ready for identify there career, they would say many things, but they are wrong because identify a career at a young age make us, as student more professional and help as to know what we want to be in are future, and identify a career at a young age is like identify are future. Identify are future at a young age make us more professional. In the future the number of unemployment people will decrease, because the student are going to be more professional, they will commit to a career at a young age and that way the life will be more easy.

460,460,327F4BCC9E4B,"The idea that businesses have made is very important. Finding means to conserve energy and resources are important in our daily life. Most people use energy and resources in their day to day activities which put more pressure on the use of energy and resources. This four-day work week will conserve the workload on energy and resources. I agree to the fact that my school should follow the four-day school week with each day consisting of ten hours. When the school time is extended, it will make students have more time to do any unfinished assignments in a particular class. Students can do more work and cover many topics in a day. This will make teachers do a lot of work in a day. For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class. If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school. Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasnt considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage. In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

The first impression is what the person make you feel. The first impression is what the person show you. The person can not change at the first impression, they most need to have the specific time to change. One of the most important fact to change is time. For example, is a person is fighting with a employee at the Ice cream story, you can not can change that person that way the he think. Maybe you must wants that. He need to realise what he is doing is something wrong .The person most have his reason for the fight. The person need time to change not at the firt moment the you meet. Most people can determine that they need time to cange. Another example of that is someone have a really bad adiction to do someting that do not have none benefict for his life.

First impression is actually what the person make in you. Sometimes is not the best impression that the person make .Sometimes you must want to change that at the same moment even is you do not know the person. The person can change with effort is you talk to the person and let her know that what is doing is not right. Maybe the person can change but not at the first impression that need take time.

463,463,4351657CEC2F,"Do I agree with churchill""s statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? In my opinion I do agree with his statement because everyone fails at something in life. Theres so many people that fail in the world and I definetly agree with churchills statement because i think it really says a lot about life in general its not easy. One reason is because I believe that everyone goes through some type of failure in life and I feel like thats the only way you learn from anything. I also think that people that fail are people that succeed at what they failed at. Thats the only way you learn from anything for example people can fail at taking a test or playing a sport. Not everything people do the first means there gonna succeed which isnt always the case. I feel like when people fail thats when they can take the time and realize why they failed they learn from that mistake and the next time a oppurtunity comes for them to try again they can try there best and succeed. Trying your hardest is the best way to deal with a lot of things thats the only way to succeed in your best way. Another reason I agree with this statement is because life isnt easy there are a lot of challenges your gonna come upon and all you have to do is try and if you fail the first time then theres always gonna be another oppurtunity around the corner. What I think churchill is trying to get at people is never give up and hes trying to say that its okay if you fail the first time you try something theres always gonna be another chance to prove yourself and you can succeed at that goal or test you have in school or something like that. Ive failed many times in my life and on the second try i succeeded so churchill has a point when he says that its okay to fail in life because thta failure prepares you to be better than you were the last time. That is why I agree with this statement because i believe tha everyone deserves a second chance to prove themselves and what they are campable of. Churchills statement should really speak to people and people should take it into consideration because theres always a time in life when you are going to fail and you are going to get a second chance at it again. I do completly agree with this statement because it makes you look at life and everything differently and in a better way that is why i agree with Winston Churchill.

They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid.

Another reason, is if you try do your best in a situation you could end up learning something new. Lastly, if you dont put any effort try to resolve a problem you could end up back in that hole. I agree with this quote because if you dont try to do your best in a situation you could end up regretting your decision. One reason, is the amount effort you put in to a problem could affect your future. Also, a chance to do your best to fix a problem could be a one time opportunity. One example, of this is about my cousin he could have been playing professional soccer but he didnt try his best on the tryout which made him not make the team.

The smart phones play a vital role in todays society , it is the hobby of the century. The schools are now taking the advantage of the new technology , but along with the new use comes new problems. Although, using the technology in schools becomes a faster way to learn , most schools are relying in the new invention of the century. Nevertheless, distraction in the schools will be a problem, also the students will be less perceptive in class because the students will fail to maintain self control over their devices and the results will be disastrous in their future. To begin, the students in the school should have all the things they need to learn such as books, they should not rely on the devices to give them certain information. For example, the internet has a wide variety of information which could have a negative or a positive impact on the user , also the information in the web is very inaccurate which could lead to misunderstanding. This shows that the students could gain wrong information and could be getting a misconception in the topic , which could lead to failure in academics and to achieve nothing in their future careers. Clearly, the user have to make a wise decision between using an information in their cell phones that could possibly be wrong, or use a textbook that it is revised by many authorized teachers. Further more, in todays society there is social media which is use to stay in touch with close family members who are far away. Cell phones are a great tool for anything , it is a mini computer. The students will be using their cell phones in social media to talk to friends instead of focusing on their task. For instance, if the school allowed such action, not only will be making a very poor decision but the school will earn a bad reputation from parents and even to the national level. This proves that it will not only hurt the kids academically but the school itself will have a downfall in popularity. Obviously, the teachers and staff will be unemployed by the county due to the lack of income from the state , teachers but not only students will be damaged by the decision that could be taken. Overall, having the ability to own a cell phone is a privilege to have not a right , teachers and administrators should take away the device from the student if and only if the student is not cooperating, and return it at the end of the school day or simply not bring it to school. The devices were not made to harm others in many ways that people have tried .Social media plays a role too in the students it is like a temptation in their pockets , they always have to update their status in social media and text their friends and stay off task. In conclusion, Cell phones are a great way to study and do some homework and stay in touch with family members but in school is a learning place where it should stay like that and cell phones should not take that away.

471,471,6751442A85E4,"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someones help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life. Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when youre angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. Thats the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you dont want to end up one day behind bars. Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, its most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friends trophies. I was so mad that I wasnt thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasnt right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes its better to make the right choices because it releases our stress. Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but its the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life. Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. ",8,9,8,8,8,9,1343,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

Not to be on the electronics all day that wouldnt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people wouldnt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport. Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense.

Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives shouldnt be lazy because that wouldnt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason. Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. wont have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time youll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play. Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life isnt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. ,5,4,6,4,5,6,764,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

474,474,EFE2BC73A573,"You think first impression would change a person or not? Some of are stuff that we have right now is because of first impression. In this essay I will argue about First Impression. Lets said that you go to the store and see something that you fall in love with at first impression and you buy it, but is not what you expect to be as you saw in the store because the commercial lie about the product . Now you dont think the same about the product that you fall in love at first impression. First, I disagree about First Impressions statement. The feeling of first impressions everybody have it, but is not impossible to change it. I would give you a example of how your first impressions can be change. For example you see a nice car for sale in you way home and you stop by to see the car because you are in love with the look of the car. The owner of the car let you try it and when you get inside, car interior is ruined and a lot engine problems. Now your first impressions is ruined just like the car you thought look nice. Next weak you see another car for sale close to your house, but this time the car does not engine problem and ruined interior like the last car you try. Your first impressions from a car for sale change. Second, this is my experiences with first impressions. When I was 13 years old I thought that my sister phone have the best camera ever and best software ever. Now in 2019 the new IPhone 11 come out and my first impression with the camera and software was a lot different from my sister phone. In conclusion I think first impressions can be change. Just try other placer where you can find the same product with best thing. Your first impressions about last change.

I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee its a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you dont have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it. I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have. So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you dont know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it. failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didnt find the solution at your problem. For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you dont explow your self you wont know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",4,4,6,4,5,4,1685,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
476,476,D45A0B7F9D48,"A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective. There are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful. Students should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didnt like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they dont participate,or turn in assignments. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected. In addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate. As you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy.

Many people say cellphones is a great tool for specific things, such as something you may want to know or something you do not know. In my opinion cell phones should not be allow to used it the classroom because students use cellphones all day and do no pay attention, cellphones it can be used for other things, and cellphones distract you. The students use the cellphones all day and do not pay any attention during class is really bad for students because, they come to school to learn and not be in their cellphones. For example, cellphones it may help you to look for something you might want to know, but when the test and quizzes comes students are not going to know anything because students did not pay attention for being in their cellphones the hall day doing nothing. Cellphone it can be used for other things, for text with friends or, play games during classes, for watch videos during class, listen to music and not listening on what the teacher is saying. Also students use cellphones to take videos, or photos that they want to search in their social media or just for have fun. For example some students likes to take photos of someone just for have fun or just for bully them in their social media. Some people say cellphones is a tool to do homework, project, or something you want to do in your cellphone, or when you are confused with something, however cellphones distract you to do those kind of stuff, such as being at your apps and not doing what you suppose to be doing while because you are texting or face timing someone and you get distract and you forgot about to finish your homework or classwork that the teacher have signed you to do,and your grades might go down into a zero if your keep distracting yourself being in you phone during class time. In conclusion some schools use cell phones in their classroom for educational purpose. Cellphones should not be allow during classroom for educational purposes because students would not learn anything if they are in theirs cellphones during classroom , we know that every student love being in their cellphone during the day, but cellphones will not help student in their educational purposes, and cellphones are not gonna help you learn what you need to learn during students school education.

480,480,86E335C1EB06,"Is it a good idea for a young students to commit to a career in high school? Its a great idea so students can work on there career, and not need to focus on what they dont need in high school, to work towards their career. Reasons I agree are, they may want to follow their parents choice in career, can use school courses to excel in career choice, and why its a good idea to start a young age. They can follow their parents choice in career. That can be a easy choice for many people, because the student can ask for advice from their parents. They can ask their parents what courses they took as a young student as they once were. The reader may be asking ""what if their parents didnt go to high school?"" that can be true and what if the career the parents have isnt for the student to follow. Then they dont have to follow their parent career, and they can choice their own career, or any close family members, or anyone they look up to, and would like to be as close as possible as them when their older. You can always just follow your own career and can start a generation for your family to follow your example. If the parent choice didnt work they can choose what classes they can take to help them reach the career the student wants. Schools are all different so not all of them will have the same courses. Example if you want to be a chef and some sort of cook, you can take a cooking courses for the year. The teacher can show you how to prepare a dish and how to present. There are so many choices in careers you can pick from. If you want to be a engineer you have to take your four main classes Math,Science,History,English. These classes will help you in the long run through high school years. The more experience you get from this courses will give you in vantage to the other student that choice your career later in their high school years. Finally the last reason, why its a good idea to start early. Its pretty simple that you dont have to worry about what your career is going to be. It can be a lot easier if you know what you want to be, you can already plan the courses you would like to take. When people ask you ""what are you going to do when your done with school?"" you would say ""its none of your business will see in the years to come!"". You shouldnt say that its just rude to say. When someone does say that you would have a answer and you should say it proudly. You would just focus on what you need to do. Dont let anyone distract you on what you want to do. Conclusion on why its a good ideal for students to have a career choice in their younger age. Following parents or close family member to the career they choice. If their career choice isnt for you, make a career you can follow and want to follow. Taking courses in school that can help you excel in career that you picked for yourself.

However, it is a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influences by others. It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. First reason is, People may follow every step you do, because they want to success in life by being influence by others. For example, my friend Generic_Name has a son, who according to her he wants to be a lawyer. Generic_Name husband whos name is Generic_Name is a lawyer. Although their son Generic_Name is taking only math classes in collage, which it has nothing to do with laws. Generic_Name and Generic_Name want to influence Generic_Name to become a lawyer. But Generic_Name is being influence by his Algebra class teacher. Generic_Name has a very high score on math, and his Algebra teacher believe that Generic_Name can be a math teacher in a college. Generic_Name teacher knows how hard he works to do everything right and how his behavior it is showed. Another reason is, It is the main thing to show people that they can do what they think they are not able to do. For example, when my brother was nine years old he wanted to be a Pilot, but he was just really scared of heights. When my brother graduated from high school he wanted to go to Army. Somehow my mom find out that he really did not wanted to do that what he really wanted to do was being a Pilot. My mom is a Flight Attend and she told my brother that some people will say you are too weak to do this and that, but they actually does not know what you are capable to do. With those words my mom influence my brother, and now he is a Pilot and he works for the Air Force. My mom gave him an example that no one believed on her the only person who believed on her was her mom. As my mom says, "" Dont let other people think you are not able to do things, which they were not able to do."" Some people may think that there are better ways to influence others. However, it can be true, but people get more influence by examples. There are not many ways for example, if someone who is very important who wants to influence someone else who is not that important to be come important as they are. Does not mean this person is going to have the same luck to become really important. Do not let other people influence you by other ways, let them give you an example of how you are going to success.

486,486,22E55C32A973,"Have you ever woke up one morning and thought ""man I want to do my classwork on my bed"" No? me either but I sure do think it is a good idea and let me tell you why. Students have been given the chance to work from home; instead of working in a classroom. Today I will explain why I believe students should be able to stay home instead of working from school. First reason would be you will be able to work at your own pace. For example whenever you have a test/quiz during school there is a time limit and you dont really focus while working on your test/quiz you focus more on the timing but, if you were working from home you would be able to work your pace with no worries about a bell ringing when your still on question 1. But if you were to work from home you would be able to cheat on the test or not even focus on it you could be watching TV while doing the test and that isnt the best choice but, there are ways to avoid that. Second Reason I would say is avoiding illnesses that could affect the whole school. Students do have signs almost everywhere telling them keep the school a clean place, wash your hands before stepping out the bathroom, and to keep your hands to yourself. But, sadly some students dont do that ; Now that the corona virus came out everyone is starting to be more clean but not really everyone but if you were home you wouldnt really have to worry about catching anything to make you sick unless one of your family members is really sick otherwise your good because in school theres like 1,000 or more people imagine how many germs are in the air. Not saying school is the cleanest place but our janitors do clean up after us everyday for it not to be clean but I just wouldnt believe it because there are still students that dont cover their nose/mouths when they sneeze or cough and you wouldnt have a problem if you were home. Last but not least my third reason would be less anxiety about school. As a junior I noticed many people have anxiety when it comes to school you worry about your looks, If you are smart enough, the way you say certain things I could go on with what students go through now a days people enjoy judging others even with not knowing them so it is hard to not have anxiety in school especially high school but at home you wouldnt really have to be worried or stressed about that you can be your own motivator your own hype man because no one is perfect. Now im not 100% sure about staying home and doing class from there would work out because not all students have the same mindset some like being in school because the teacher pushes them to do their work we all need a little push in life also some students can get away with so much from home if they were do a assignment or test you can just easily search up the answers. Some of my friends have done that when their teachers post things on Google classroom they dont usually do it themselves but, at the same time there is much benefits from working at home then in school not only do you get to sleep more but you also get to basically do your thing but your own way. Students working at home can make a student independent instead of being dependent on their teachers. As a student it is honestly up to you to go to class and to focus on what you are being taught it shouldnt be your teachers job to make you go to class everyday yes we all need a push in life but not every person is going to help you out you have to be independent most times. Students should work from home because in the real world not everything is going to be handed to you.",5,7,7,6,6,6,463,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency. It helps people communicate with people around the world. For example my Uncle cant leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does he cant return to the states. So the technology now allows him to Skype or Facetime his mom when he wants. In fact 70% of the people around the world can communicate. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button. People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. The cops came in like 3 minutes. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life. Technology does have a positive effect on people. It can help people talk to people all over the world. People can also call 911 for emergency. Other people believe that technology is the root of evil, however technology helps everybody no matter what.

492,492,767920BDAD93,"Wouldnt it be better if you have the option to attend your classes from the commodity of your house? Although some say that distance learning would not benefit students, actually students should be benefited from distance learning to attend their classes from home because it can help students who have disabilities and it can also help students see school from a different perspective of learning. Those who believe that distance learning would not benefit students have their reasons. They believe students could have trouble with social interaction in the future. They also think that it can motivate students to be dependable on artificial life. For example, my friend PROPER_NAME who rather attend his classes online and also rather spend his time playing video games and not with his family or friends. Distance learning can benefit students who have disabilities. When I used to live in Honduras, I had a friend called Generic_Name. Generic_Name had a weird condition on her legs, she could not walk. It was very hard for Generic_Name to attend school. Her mother, called Generic_Name, had to push her wheelchair every morning so that Generic_Name could attend school. Our school was about 30 minutes away from home, by walking. During school time, Generic_Name had to push her wheelchair to get to her classes, restroom and recess. Even though, Generic_Name would get ready early in the morning, she would usually be late for school. Sometimes, Generic_Name would not get good sleep, so it was very hard for Generic_Name to pay attention in class. I think that it was not Generic_Names fault for not attending school on time. I think that people with disabilities like Generic_Name, can benefit to attend classes online from home. It would save them time, so that they can get a good sleep to pay attention in class. Distance learning can benefit students see school from a different perspective of learning. Last year, my cousin Generic_Name, refused to go to school. My cousin, had bad grades at all of his classes, at the beginning of first quarter. My cousin didnt like school at all. He would usually say that he would always be tired to attend school because he had to wake up early in the morning. My cousin, thought that he was really bad for school. I would usually hear complains of my cousin about the schools free lunch or about him thinking that he was not made for school. My cousin then talked to his counselor about this issue of him not being able to pass all of his classes. His counselor told him that he could attend all of his classes online, so he did. My cousins grades are really good now, and he also thinks that it was and amazing experience, for having the opportunity to attend all of his classes. I think that my cousin was not bad at school, he was just not receiving the way of education he needed. I also think that people like my cousin, can be benefit by distance learning because they can experience their school year from a different way of learning. In conclusion, distance learning can benefit people with disabilities, to help them feel that their necessities also count as students. Also it can benefit people who believe that they are not good for school, so that they can experience a different way to learn and feel useful. I think that distance learning can benefit students with this kind of problems, improve and be equal like the rest of the students, regardless their way of learning.",7,6,8,7,7,7,1542,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
493,493,BF5E7CD37E4B,""" Imagination is more important than knowledge "" Can imagination be more important than knowledge? I think that imagination can be more important than knowledge. Due to the imagination of some scientists have created a massive number of inventions that benefit almost all the people of the world in that part is when knowledge is created based in imagination. In movies of sci-fi the director imagine a space full of flying cars and gas stations in the space, one great example was in the movie ""Return to the future 2"" the director and the writer of the movie imagine a skateboard that could elevate one ore two inches from the floor and they put it in the movie, and now scientist invented a skateboard that can elevate four centimeters from the floor. First of all, whiteout imagination the world couldnt be the same like we know it right know,the imagination can help to improve your knowledge. Think about that a world whit geometrical forms like squares or rectangles, horrible! For example: Bill gates was a normal person, studying in a normal university, and whit a normal family. But one day he imagine how to improve his knowledge of school of the systems of computers, then he invented windows, so thats is a great example o how imagination can change the world. Also, the imagination can help people work. You use it in projects, you use it in homework, also you use it in tests (Like me right now). For example: I was in a project of a debate of countries, my team was N.Korea, i needed to imagine if i where in Generic_City presenting my statement to all affiliated countries of UN, so i began to write, i though i was going to lose, because my enemy was the Westerns powers, but then we could win due i could imagine if the situation was like i where a person of N.Korea speaking to orders governments. Third, imagination makes you feel better, when you are bored or when you are sad, the imagination always can make you appear a smile in your face. For example: i meet a partner that was depressed, i tell him ""i know how you are going to be happy, imagine you and the people you love to be near are in a vacation, then imagine you are whit out problems, whit out school, whit out homework,etc. Now i think now you are willing to be without stress or difficulties in these day"", he told me he was better. Finally, I think and many people does is that whit out imagination we couldn live happy and whit a lot of fun, knowledge is a part of the bast world of imagination.

494,494,C15EC5707409,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools. In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldnt keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school. Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks. Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year. In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. Students will be very streful and tired during class. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades.

It is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. Because in some of the cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. For example, a very famous statement says, ""After the storm comes the calm."" This can be similar with the Churchills statement. Because this explain that it doest matter how worst you see it but it would be great after the problems or you are struggle with. Furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard things, for example something that people says, ""Nothing is impossible if you dont tried."" and ""Nothing is easy in this life."" This is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know. Additional, the word ""failure"" plays an important role to be success. One important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and dont want to fight that victory of success anymore. Sometimes you can fail but that doest matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. That would be one of your goals that you would remember.

501,501,0F3EC382C3CB,"The benefits of working in as a group or working alone. I believe working as a group is more beneficial for the students. My friend Generic_Name is very capable of doing school work by himself. However, even he needed others help to understand somethings. I am very capable of doing a school project by myself. However, even I could use some one elses input in the matter. I believe working together as a group is beneficial . For example, my friend Generic_Name he is a very smart person. He was on the top of the class with grades but, even he could not do it by himself. One day the teacher assigned us projects. Generic_Name decided to do it alone. On the due date, which was later that week Generic_Name turned in the project. The teacher told him he failed he did not understand why. The teacher later on the day took him aside and explained that he was not understanding the question. He asked her how he could make up the points for the failed project. Two weeks after that she assigned another project. She took Generic_Name aside and said this time work with somebody"". Generic_Name listed so he asked somebody to work with him. The day the project was due, he was nervous because he does not work with people often. The teacher told him they got a perfect score. The teacher took him aside and told him why he passed. She told him he passed because when you have more than just one persons input. Things become clear so when you do not understand something that other persons input can help. Another reason I believe working as a group helps is when I was in high school we were assigned a two part project. The first part I had to do by self. I got it done when the due date came the teacher told us to pick a partner. I picked a friend of mine, Generic_Name. The teacher told us to compare our papers. However, our paper even though they were on the same subject, they were very different. She later told us to now write a paper on the same subject but working together. When we were all done with the two parts she told everyone to rotate their papers to the right once. Everyone passed them on the teacher then told the whole class to read all three papers and to pick which one made more sense. When every one was done they all picked the one that made the most sense and gave it to her. Every single one of those papers she got were all the one people worked on together. She then asked the class why they did not pick the other one. They all said because the other papers were one sided as in only one perspective. Some students may say working alone is better. However, Generic_Name and I both learned that in some places you need two sides to a story, argument and debate. If I would have gone on with my life thinking the way I thought before I worked with some one, it would be very different in some perspective. My friend Generic_Names life would have been very different too. Thanks to the team work skill and the skill to listen to other peoples side, Generic_Name and I can make decision with some one instead of just making it alone. I recommend you talk to your teacher about this and get more group projects going. Talk to your parents about how you could use those skills in the outside world, become surprised by how much you use them, and by how easier your life become. When you do not have to make decision alone, decision making becomes much easier.",8,6,7,7,8,7,202,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything. Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it.

You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it. Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they dont want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have.

No wonder so many of us are depressed, they see what other people have but to blind to see what they have is important. Everyone sees the same thing but have a different perspective. Time wasting is a big one. Peoples eyes are glued to there own personal screen. Sheeple. They care about the new, the best, the bad, and the ugly. They only care about themselves and there phones and shirts with a red bar that says supreme in white text.

505,505,CA2B324678EA,"Generic_Name State of Virginia 03/19/2019 Dont matter if we are youngs, we can learn everything. Some people think that the students can not identify a career by the time they enter to high school. Two years ago when I entered to high school I was not sure what I want to be. Now, I know what I want to be, but that is thanks to my school that they have many ideas how we can identify a career. The last year I was in Internship class that was great because they give me the opportunity to get a job. The job was about secretery I was in love with this job; however, was not easy to learn but I liked. I would like to be a secretary. It is a good idea for students to commit to a carreer at a young age because we can mature our mind, develop our skills, and develop our passions. We are students of high shcool, and we can identify a career and more many things. To begin, When we learn about career we can start to mature our minds. Students in high school get experiences learn about how they can find a job. In Generic_School my school, we have Internship class. This class consist to help students to find a job and they can see how to work in the comunity. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult. We learn that the work is a big responsability. Thats why we have to start to know about careers in high school. It is so important identify what we want to do when we grow-up. Additionally, develop our skills is a great idea that can help us. Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. We can develop many many skills if we wants. Just we need to try. If we wants a great career we need to put in practice the dicipline. We can do everything what we want because we are intelligents,positives,and great students. keep going becauses thats is the only way that we have. Lastly, When we develop our passions we can get a good career. If we have something that would like to be for example: doctors, secretary, actors, or nurse whatever we want. I would like to say go head! we can do it. The life is a challenge if we dont try we can never get a good career. Firts step we need to faces our fears. Second step we need to put all our efforts every day. Students in high school need to know these two steps. Students have all the capacity to learn everything, so lets go to do it. To summarize, all the students should identify a career in high school. Students develop their emotional knowledgel; also, we start to proceed as adult. Many students learn many laguages this is a great skill because we can travel every where, comunicate with other people, know other cultures; also, if we speak differents languages we can earn more money, get a better job. develop our skills is so important.

Four years later, I met him at a restaurant and he was a whole new person, he dressed different and his personality was different, Generic_Names influences in public schools changed him. Peoples character traits are formed by influnces beyond our control because the enviroment that we live in takes a huge part on how we are, who we are, and how we act, and because of people like our parents that have guided us and influenced us throughout our whole lives, and while some people say that a person is able to choos who they are or control their character traits, the majority of the people in society live by other peoples influences. The enviroment that a person lives in takes a huge part on someones character because; their culture, their religion, and the people they surroud themelves with, always have an impact on someones traits; for example, a private christian school student might not have the the character traits as a public school student because the enviroments are way different. In conclusion peoples traits are controled by influces beyond our control because people is always getting influenced on the daily regardless of what envioment theyre in. People like our parents are responsable for most of the character traits we have since they have been with us our whole life. They guide us everyday, and they teach us what is right and what is wrong. Most of the kids in this world look up to their parents or use them as a role model, and that controls a huge part of our character traits. In conclusion our traits are formed by incluences out of our control because our parents, who have been with us our whole life impact us every day with thei lessons. Some people say that a person is able to control their character traits or choose who they are, because they are alone and they probably dont like talking to people or learning from people so; therefore they dont get influenced by anyone , so they start forming their character and they start being who they are base on only what they do. Most of the people in this world are influenced by the outside since most poeple go to work everyday, go to school everyday, and talk to people everyday, thay are always getting something out of someone, it could be an advice or a lesson. I dont think many people are able to control their character traits on these days with social media, and things like that going on. In concluison our character traits are controled by influences we cant control because the enviroment with live in always has an impact on us, the people we surround ourselves with have an impact on us and society in general has an impact on us. Moving forward i think it would be good for people to keep being influnced by the outside because we will get to know how everything works, and no matter who we are influenced by there will always be someone that will tell is if its right or wrong.",6,6,7,7,7,6,3808,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
507,507,DD279F25DC1F,"""Oh my God Generic_Name,"" I did not have enough time to finish my power point, me too Generic_Name said. I think our school should add two hours more and we should come four-day school weeks like some businesses they work for ten hours and they only work four days it can benefits students and teachers because, some students can have more time to do their homework, some teachers and students can saved more gas and money, and some students can ask their teacher for more help. First,students and teachers saved more gas and money. For example, my friend needs to drive herself to school everyday and she needs to pay for her gas. The other day she told me that coming to school for five days is stressful because, she has to pay for gas and she is not working everyday like she just too, so her parents have to pay the gas for her .They told her if she do not start to pay for her own gas they where going to take the car away from her, I told her about how some businesses have adopted just going four- days to work for ten hours and I told her that our school should have four-day school week too, I think that would be a good idea and she thinks that is a great idea too, because she gets to saved money and gas and she do not have to worry about paying a lot of money for gas anymore and her parents would not be mad at her anymore because she would have the money to pay for gas. Other example can be my Spanish teacher she lives a little far from school and she has to drive to school, but she is having some problems and she does not have enough money to pay for her gas. She told me that if she do not get the money to pay her gas she was going to be absent for some day into she get the money to buy gas for her car, that make me so sad because she is my favorite teacher, she is like a mom to me, and she would not be able to come to school just because she dont have enough money to pay her gas. My friend told her about what I said and she things its a great statement because she would have more time to grade students homework ad would have more time to spent with her family. Second, students can have more time to do their homework. For example, myself sometimes in my math or chemistry class we talk about something new and it takes almost the hold class and my teachers give us a lot of homework so I think the if we go school for ten hours it would be great because I would have a lot of time to do all my homework or I would have time to study too and I would just get home to relax and I would not get stress because I already did my homework. Other example can be my best friend Generic_Name, she is taking all AP classes, and she gets a lot of homework sometime she does not get the enough time to finish her homework in class and when she gets home she has to take cared of her little sister, so she does not have time to finish her homework at home or sometimes she has projects do the next day but she does not have enough time finish in class. Generic_Name said that she gets really stress about all her homework and how she has to do it in so little time, she thinks if we go to school for more time she would have a lot of time to do her homework and she would just go home and take care of her little sister, she should not have to be stress about doing her homework. Another example can be my friend Generic_Name, she loves to do homework because she likes to compete with other students, but ladle she has being so worry and angry about everything. I ask her why does not she compete with the other kids like she used to, she told me because she has a lot of tests coming up and she needs to study and that she wish that we have more time in school so she can get everything done the same day because now she has to take her homework to her house and finished over there, now she does not get time to relax and chill like she always did. Third, some students can ask their teacher for more help. Like myself the other day in math class we were talking about a new topic it was so hard that I did not understand the topic. After the teacher show us how to do it, I was asking for help every three seconds because I did not understand, after she explain me for the hundred time I was still confused, before the class end she gave us homework I did not how to do the homework ether, so I stay after with her so she could it explain me again, but the after school time is only for fifteen minutes. My teacher explain me again and show me how to do it again but I did not get it, she told me the if we have more time in school hours it would be better because would take her time and explain us how to the work more slow, but we only have like one hour in her class so we do not get enough time ask a lot of questions. Other example, my friend Generic_Name sometimes his teacher talk so fast that he can understand what she is saying, he want it to stay after school so she could explain him again, but he could not stay because needed to go soccer practice he being missing a lot of day because he always stay after school with a teacher for extra help and if he does not start going to soccer practice again, his coach is going to kick him out of the team, he is the only one that has been missing a lot of days, and he needs to get back in track because his team has a really important game coming up, so he can not stay after school for help anymore. Some students think that they get stress for being in school for a lot of time;however, they are wrong because some students think that if they go to school for a lot of time they would get more time to do their homework. Some students and teachers get to saved more money and gas, some student can have more time to do their homework, and some students can ask their teacher for more help this are some benefits of why should my school adopt a four-day school week.",8,8,8,7,7,6,3137,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
508,508,7333B4549006,"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldnt follow this model. students already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. Its better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education. Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Students always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they dont have time in class or teachers dont have time for students. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some students may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. Its very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students its very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student. Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesnt mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didnt study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didnt know the meaning of study in that time thats why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holidays will give more tension to student thats why they didnt study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school. In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isnt bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesnt want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger whos fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. Its better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in students school life. At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up. They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school.

509,509,FF66DA76E15F,"Even though imagination is more important than knowledge, thinking in a creative way is better than learning something from somewhere. Yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because its letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. Also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but I try using imagination a little more than knowledge. Although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. Imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because I let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative. Becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. Knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when Im imagining, therefore I have to start imagining. I think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because Im thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. In that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. Imagination makes me passionate about what I want to do and accomplish it. Ive always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. That designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. All of that was because of imagination, I wanted to accomplish that when I graduate from college. Imagination doesnt just help me with what I want to accomplish it also helps me decide what I want to be when I grow up. Otherwise imagination wouldve not gotten us to where we are right now. Finally, Imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. It also brings us joy and things that we dont really imaging on our daily bases. Although, knowledge is not important than imagination I still think that Knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something. Therefore I thing that imagination is more important than knowledge because it help me with my daily bases work at school, home, sports and all kinds of other things that I do.",6,6,7,8,7,6,3892,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

512,512,FDC94E0FE9C8,"Have you ever did something because is on trend or just because someone else did?. As you must know humans are easily influenced by others way of thinking and acting and it is because we want other people to like us showing that humans are social individuals. The best way of influencing others is setting an example by ourselves because we tend to compare ourselves to other people, also humans repeat what they like like the fashion trends, and lastly, because social pressure can lead us to do things even if we dont want to just because everyone else did. Everyone is influenced by what others thinks or do. First, we have to begin with the way in which we usually compare ourselves to other people. Is common that if we see someone breaking the rules well claim that ""We are on our right to do it to"" . Or we can just see that this happens a lot between siblings; if one of the siblings gets something the other one will want the same. For example, when my parents buy something for my brother, I want them to buy something for me to. Or when they let my brother be out until a late hour, Ill claim that I have the right to do the same the next time I go out. People is always comparing themselves to others in what they have or dont have. Next, is imperative to analyze the humans dependence in wearing what others wear just because is in trend. If for example Gigi Hadid wears sweat pants with heals and looks good, every girl in the world would run to buy the same clothes and wear them because now is a trend; or if a girl in my school wears makeup in some way and I liked how it looked, Ill copy the look and wear it some other day. Humans like parrots repeat what they like. Finally, the social pressure can make us do things we dont want to just because someone else did. That is why many times weve heard "" If other people jumped from the bridge, Will you do it to?"". For example if we are on a party and someone offers a drink, the probability of drinking it is high because everyone else is doing it, and we want people to like us. If someone challenges us, we would do it because we want people to like us. Social pressure is an influence in what people do. In conclusion, Setting an example on our own will help us a lot in making people do what we want them to do. A smile is contagious, kindness is contagious and humans as social individuals repeat what they like and humans want people to like them.",7,6,8,7,6,7,3852,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

The majority of people classify the type of person base on how they look, What I believe is that your clothes and how your look do not say or show your type of personality or the kind of person who you really are. Base on my short experience to know a person takes time and the first impression could be unfavorable in strong relationships or friendships thats why I believe that who you are will depends on knowing the what kind of person you are. Most of the strong friendships or relationships that I know they were enemies or they did have a good impression about the person at first time but through the time they had the privilege to know the person and they found a good kind of person. To conclude the first impression is good way to present ourselves but through knowing the person we will find that the first impression does not care when knew the kind of person thats why I believe that first impression could change through knowing that person.",7,7,6,7,7,8,2132,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

You ever heard of the quote,""Dont judge a book by its cover? I honestly believe in that. I was once a scrawny kid getting bullied cause of the way I carried myself and dressed. I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. But little did they know i was the nicest and honest kid at Generic_School. In the year 2015 throughout 2018 I was someone I really wasnt. I was in the streets doing the opposite of what my mother showed me. Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids. By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me. Moral of the story is dont let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not.

516,516,D06C0F3D5553,"People love doing their favorites things where it will keep them safe and healthy. Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed. To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we dont talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you havent been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. Its important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so thats why you should go outside and play with your friends. In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesnt give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldnt focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didnt have any stress after in 2016. its important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so thats the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends. In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesnt give you any bad day or anything like obviously you dont want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

519,519,8DA298718DD7,Students will benefit from take the school classes at home instead of going to the school because they could work at their own pace. Students dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Students come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Students take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if students are really sick and cant come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the students keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that students that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Students would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the students dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The students can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the students with computer skill while doing online school. Students would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the students can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time students dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning. It will save a lot of time for the students and teachers because they wouldnt have to be there the whole day at school. It will make more people like school because you can take it online and you can finsh it at any hour but its due that day. ,7,7,8,7,6,7,1879,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

521,521,EC3B982A622A,"I do not agree with adding another hour to school, because some of us would like to go home, some people have places to go after school. For example what if a student wants to go pick up his grandma from the airport but her flight gets in while the student is still in school. If school wouldve ended at the normal time he couldve went to pick up his grandma. Even though staying an hour more would help students more, there wont be anytime left for after school activities. in the winter time it gets dark fast and some kids like to go outside and play for a while after school,but if they add that extra half an hour kids would have to get home fast and leave there stuff to go outside for a little bit. There are many bad reason why adding another hour to school is a bad idea but, there are many good ones too like a good reason would be kids can catch up on there missing work, a bad idea is kids go home later then they used to and some parents would not like that. If they do add an hour of school they should open the school at 8:30 instead of 7. If we come at 8 kids would get more sleep and not fall asleep in class with more sleep kids have more energy and with ms are more energy kids are more productive. In my opinion i dont think adding another hour is not so bad, just that no other student would wanna stay another hour. Students could get frustrated because all the work they do at school,and then kids got to go home and study and do there homework. Therefore i disagree with the idea of adding another half an hour.",6,5,6,7,7,5,3448,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
522,522,9715AAF5B952,"Have you thought about your first impression of someone and did it change or not? because our first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at a new school and when you go to an interview for job. First, first impression are possible to change when you are making new friends at new school because people can look at you by the way you are quite, shy, and serious. But once they start to get to know you they start realizing that you are talkative, loud, and fun to hangout with. Their first impression of you starts to change. For example, when I met Generic_Name I thought she was ignorant, rude, and selfish but when I started to hangout with her I noticed that she was a sweet and caring girl. And we became really good friends even my first impression of her from the beginning changed. Second, first impression are possible to change when you go to an interview at work because when you arrive at the interview it may seem that dont have the courage to work by the way you act. Meanwhile those impressions start to change because they notice that you actually want to work and you want to put an effort on the job. For example, When I went to an interview for a job the manager thought that I didnt actually wanted to work and that I wouldnt take it serious just by the way I look. Later on he realized that I actually wanted the job even that I would take it serious. In other hand some people think that by the way I talk or my face impression, people think that I wont get the job because I would not take it serious but they are wrong because once they start to get to know me. They start realizing that I actually want the job. In conclusion, first impression are actually possible to change when people are making new friends at school and when you get an interview for job because we need to get to know each other better, instead of letting our first impressions be right.

People just wanna finish their jobs very fast, and they wanna get where their going really fast, and that leads to not have a good attitude with others, one of the first reasons is you can get to your dream job, for example if your positive with others they can like you or offer you a deal thats going to change your life for ever, and they may say that your a great person, and they might offer you to come and work in their company or work in a really great passion. Another reason is you can make someones day or make them happy, for example their having a really bad day and you come and talk to them with a positive attitude, and maybe your going to make them really happy and also that can effect on others if you make them happy they can make others people happy also. One last reason is Communication, for example by having a positive attitude you can communicate with others, and you can have a good relationship with them and maybe be really good friends.

525,525,ECF265A73C7E,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students dont have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher wont let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school. The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",7,7,7,8,8,8,3463,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

As an example for that could be, that every time people is not using a light at their house they must turn it off. Also when students use their computers at school for a long time just playing games and charging it, its a waste of energy. Not every body understand how important the energy is. This is why bussinesses and schools should adopt a four-day week, with each day consisting of then hours. Having a four-day work week has their benefits. Workers would only work four days and have three day weekend, they would have more time to rest, and have a time with their families. On the other hand working requires using energy for any type of power tools as computers, printers, and construction tools. Working four days a week will decrease the use of energy. Also some people drive to their job, and others ride the bus, using this method of working only four days a week will safe the people more resources, as gasoline, money, and vehicles. As working four days a week has their benefits, it also has their disadvantages. students would have to go school, and workers would have to go to work only four days a week, of each day consisting of ten hours. Students would have to stay at school two more hours, meaning they would waste more energy as they usually do. Workers would waste a very big amount of enegy due by the power tools they use. Students would only go to school for four days, and wokers to work for only four days as well, but each day constis in ten hours, however they still will work for forty hours, as if they worked five days a week, workers and studets will be wasting the same amount of energy and resources. Being a student and going to school for only four days a week and having a three day weekend has their benefit. Students would have more time to complete their homework, and study for tests. On the other hand going to school requires to waste some energy, and resources, students uses their computer that they need to charge, and teachers uses paper every day, while using this method students and tacher would safe resources and energy. Some students drive to school, others take the bus, or they also drive to academies, this all relates to the wasting of energy and resoruces as gasoline. Otherwise going to school for only four days a week, will decease all the energy used in computer, and the gasoline the cars need to get students to school. Students going to school only four days a week has their benefits and disadvantages. Students would waste less energy than they do in five days, they aslo would waste less gasoline and money if they only come four days. Having this method the comminuty would safe a lot of energy and resources that can be need it for the future. Schools should follow this model by extending the school days two hours and waste less energy and resources.

The can even get lunch and hang out if they have a break time. Some people like to talk a lot and geting to know the people they work with. If you are working with a group you can get more frends they can get more friends by talking to them. Second by doing things for them like helping them with their homework. You also ge more friends by making them laugh and giving them things. I know it is hard getting to know people more getting to know people can be hard because some people are shy like me. It might take them a while to met new poeple. Some people just do not like talking because they can be really shy and get nervous their hands can get really sweaty. I chose working wih a group because the benefis can help out a lot of people like me that are really shy and onse I get to know them I wont get shy as much like I use to be. Finally people are fun to hang out with like my English teacher Generic_Name she is a really good teacher and makes everyone smile and laugh.

532,532,C05745235FE7,"Is it good idea for high school students, the can graduate in three years instead of traditional four years? Some school distract offer program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years. Most high school students who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or may not be able to take elective courses. If students end up their high school in three year, the would missed most of opportunities that could provide better knowledge and education for them. Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students couldt get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. To begin with, first reason, students couldt receive enough credits to graduate. For example, when college student want to be successful Doctor, he or she must get enough classes during the 7 years to receive approximately credits to get their diploma, if the require to graduate in 5 years, the cant construct enough confidence to be a good Doctor for the community and society. This example shows, students shouldt graduate early, because the cant developed and improve their life skills, education, and knowledge. If students graduate early, the would get an anxiety and different kinda problems in their life. High school traditional four years is the natural path that can help student to be success and give them more educational opportunities. Furthermore, second reason, students cant improve or developed their confidence and their knowledge. For example, when the student who graduated early try to do an experiment he/she wouldt believe their decision and the doest have any positive confidence to get the result successful. This example shows, students should not graduate early, because the wouldt have any strong confidence to do something successful. Students shouldt required to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years of high school. If students graduate in three years of high school, the will face to anxiety problems, challenges, and work challenges. Some peoples argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills. For example, when I was in Afghanistan I was about to graduate high school in 2 years, also I had the most opportunities to receive grateful education. However, students shouldt be require to finish their high school in three years instead of four years because students would be leftover from others and the would never confidence on the experiment and life skills. Students shouldt graduate in three years, the should take the elective classes to get more information about the world, regions and humans. In conclusion, Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students couldt get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. However, Some peoples argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills.

Schools goal is to offer for students classes from home to make sure students do their best in order to pass and graduate. Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home because students love the idea of taking their courses at home, will have more time to do any activities they could not do in school day time, and its more easier. First, students love the idea of taking classes at home because students do not have to wake up early for school, that give students more time to sleep and all of us know how important to get your daily hour sleep on our brains. Also, its good for students who are shy for what ever reasons. I know someone who took classes at home for third and fourth quarters, so he didnt have to go to school. The classes he took started at six PM every Monday and Wednesday. This guy told me that online classes were helpful for him and made him pass. Second, students will have more time to do any activities. Schools started at eight AM and ends at three PM. At this time, students could do any thing like working in the morning time or help parents in anything or do anything else. Students could use this seven hours to do anything that may help them in the future. As I said before, online classes start at six PM and ends at eight PM. Generic_Name, my closest friend, took classes at home, so he could work and get money. Students take classes at home at home because its more easier. Many students said that is better to take our classes at home because its more easier and teachers teach in really simple way that make anyone understand than what school do. Students wants to pass so they takes the easy way that the school offer to pass, and as I said before, schools offer distance learning to make students succeed. Generic_Name, one of my best friends, took online classes, and he told me thats his teacher was really good because of the way that the teacher taught them back then, makes everything easier and simple that even a kid could understand it. Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home not just because its easy or can attend it from home. Schools goal is to make sure we succeed on this classes, and thats what schools here for. Is to open the way for us to create the future because if students are 20% of our present, they are 100% of our future.

535,535,72765D1D4721,"Should we as students learn from home or school ?. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree with this because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students drop out of school. Many people believe that learning at home by a way of online or video conferencing is a great idea to attend classes from home. In my opinion, Its a bad idea because some students would not attend their classes from home. For example, students can wake up late for these online classes and forget about them throughout the whole day. In another case students wont do anything at home because they are at home relax and doing nothing but, just watching tv and playing video games. What if a student gets sick at home ? they wont do the work that is due while they are at home, some while take like the whole week off and not do anything at all. Thats my first reason why we shouldnt attend school from home. My second reason why students shouldnt attend classes from home is because some studennts can cheat on a test or quiz while they are at home. For example, students can search up the answers on online or use textbooks to help them out at home. I say this because they will use the internet or a textbook because they know that theres no teacher watching them cheat on the test or quiz while they are at home taking it. Students always find a way to cheat and plus if they take a test or a quiz at home, they are for sure going to cheat on it because they know that there isnt any teachers telling them to put their phones away or notes. Thats my second reason why we shouldnt attend school from home. My final reason why students shuldnt attend classes from home is because this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. For example, what if students dont attend their classes at home and also what if the ones that actually do their work do bad on it ?. Teachers can be balme for this because the way they teach it throughout online or video conferencing. This puts teachers in a bad situtation because that means they are not doing well while they are teaching online or video conferencing. Another example is, some students can just drop out of school while they do this at home. For example, if they dont do any work at home they might just drop out of school without telling anyone. Students can give up easily and just contiune their life without any education. Thats my final reason why students shouldnt attend classes from home. In conclusion, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I strongly disagree because some students would not attend the classes from home, some students will cheat on a test or quiz while they are home, and the final reason is that this can make teachers lose their jobs as teaching and make some students to drop out of school. So in my case you should talk with your principle about this offer, unless theres a sicknees happening throughout the world and its making school to shut down and do online classes.

536,536,44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didnt like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college. one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport. Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you dont have time to be in drama get in trouble. Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with. In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret .

But think about the children may think its a bad idea and I agree with them as well. Why? you may ask, well lets think about it kids dont want to be at school for a very much more time in what they are already in for. Many students go to after school activities at certain times and get out later others dont but do some outside of school activities like sports, helping the community, getting chores done, {etc.}. You may seem like those arent important but for the students do think its important and also school, but the home work time they have left to do at home my not be a good idea on the different after school programs they may be in at different times when it starts and when it end times go fast and may not be time to go over homework or study for a test the next day. Education are good for the kids but getting low grades may not help them in the future and for the family. Many students wont have anytime to be spending with their family together any more with those times being spent on school and sports and other activities. Families may think its a bad idea too add more hours to school and to take away time after school to get things done and to have time to enjoy with families at outside places at an restaurant or to go out for walks before bed times and the next day. While other parents my think if there going to add more time to school then students should arrive to school at least 20 minutes later for kids to have more time to sleep for an long school day, so they wouldnt be sleepy in the mornings. As may I think that over the week ends families like to go to far places and if students end up having projects and home work to do could effect the time with family and school and that wouldnt be so good for the students. Think about it kids not doing well in homework and test for not studying for not have any time after school for the extra hour and thirty minutes they are going to get that wont be good for the school county and less students would start coming to there schools and rather transfer to a better school with less hours or just consider home school and your school would have kids leaving and wont be able to have students to teach anymore.

This is mena that people setitng their direction to high they falling quick, but they setting their direction too low that achieve their mark. For my opinion, people set their aim as high as they can, because they know that if they set too low; they wont have that power to finish or to get it. This made people thought their aim is high; they need to work harder not just the 100 precent they need to put more than 100 precent into it and get thieir aim.

Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test. First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important. Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test. Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more. In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. It is also good for some student. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success. So I feel like an extra 30 minutes is not that long so some student would also not mine.

541,541,BCF16DEB277E,"Many people can set a good example by the way the behave but you can also Influence people by the your professional career you have. I believe example is not the main thing it is the only thing because younger people growing up look up to you by the way your behavior is and they hear the kind of language you use towards friends and adults. For example, when I was growing up I looked up to my brother I watched his actions very closely. One day I saw my brother giving food to poor people at 7 eleven and I was shocked, the next day I went to give food at 7 eleven. Eventually, as I was leaving the store the manager called me up and asked me why I was giving food out and I told him that I saw my brother giving so I thought that was the right thing to do. In another occasion my brother and mom went to the toy store to buy some toys for a birthday present for my cousin and my brother really wanted this toy so and my mom said that she was not going to buy for him so he started kicking the floor because he was mad at my mom and because of that my mom bought him the toy. So the next day my mom took me to the supermarket with her and I really wanted this snack from the shelf and she said that I could not buy it so I started kicking the floor and crying therefore my mom bought me the snack. Since I saw my brothers actions and behavior towards my mom and saw it worked out well I did the same thing. For instance, one day I heard my mom arguing with my dad on the phone because of some misunderstanding they had and my mom was using foul language to address her part of the side and my dad was using it too. So later on in the day my mom called me on the phone and told me to go get my little brother at school and I told her it was not my problem to get him and then I started using foul language on the phone because I thought it was okay because she used on my dad. In another occasion I heard my brother giving out compliments to people on the street and by the way he spoke it influenced me to say the same thing as him as walked the streets. Some people may argue that people get better influenced by a person of its professional career because they think they got to the place there at right now by showing they can go anywhere no matter what example they show. In conclusion I believe that example is the one and only thing that influences others becasue what your actions do your younger sibling and friends are going to follow it and get influenced by you. the actions my brother took I followed them if though they were good or bad I got influenced by it. Also the way my mother was speaking and the language she was using towards my dad influenced me to speak back to her that way when she called me.

They believe that the source of true is self esteem is achevement. I take a positions on this issue I think that will look in the future. I think that are different peoples some person not look its future only think that the life them treat only of to live but not undertoond that not is only life. I think that students have reason of thougtht that is this is an achievement not is easy we have a achievement yes we have a achievement in this life because yes not have an achievement I do know that you thought in my opinion the trues is the point number firts in this life because that is really happened the true is import always me question for me is that yes not have true all away different. Some things of this paragraph elieve o this prompt is that understand that the students they believe that students must be self confident and that sense have this world power CONFIDENT are two world confident and confidence Confident is feeling or showing that your are sure about your own abilities opcions and confidence is trust or stong belief in someone or something. I have every confidence in ability to do the job. They have much confident and they have much order to learn more order is to tell someone to do something in a strong way which does not permit him to refuse and without saying they ordered to learn more learn is to get knowledge a skill they learning work they thounght that are the best. They have achievenment something that is done successfully espeacially through hard work or skill. The act of finishing something successfully the feeling that you get when you have finished something sucessfully. They in learning by lowering to move someone or something down to make something less in amount or quality. I think that the life have must chance or opportunity of have one better life of enjoy every moment yes have work hard but always enjoy every minut every hour every every year with the family is important in this life not all only have that them job always think that have must time and to stop one moment and look this life will look the future. What is an future? an future is at or to a greater distance in time more to a greater degree the board needs time to consider the matter futher. I cant remember any futher back than 1995 at or to a greater distance in space. However many people also use futher when talking about distances especially in formal coversation only futher can be used in other senses we need a futher week to finish the project but make your life no have self rich with only proffession make your future preofession a type of job that needs special training or skill especially one that needs a high level of education and yes have one occupation is always a job or profession always a employment is a work specially when it is done to earn money its very difficult to find work at the moment. I think that yes have a carrer like the student best effort but work I think that I can always but have a carrer the job or series of jobs that someone has in a particular are of work usually involving more resposibility as time passes I have a friend she had a very distingushed carrer in medicine she have a profession I do know because is different a prefession with carrer or trade I think that a trade is a hob always but specially one that involves working with your hands and requieres special training but now talking of the students I think that not have a job because thought that they not have a experience in a job. I do know that must talking of this only think in the job and the student that the other people thought that they no have experience and that is esperience is to have somehing happen to you to feel something it was the firts time I had ever experenced failure and experinced is having the knowledge or skill that is necessary for something the true this student put in me an expiration because the point important this but they is the true they have a good point the sincerity the quality of being sincere or honest sincere used about a person really meaning or believing what you say not pretending sincerely in a way that shows what you really feel or think about someone or something. The students have praising like you say when you are expressing admiration for someone or somethig I think that they have a precaution always precaution in the job I think precaution is something that you do now in order to avoid danger or problems in the future. We took the precaution of locking our valuables in the things with safe like precautions against fire. The students I think that they thought in implore when you implore someone when the situation is very serious and you need something very much.

543,543,E34E1B7D1691,"""I want to be a singer!"", is what I told everyone, at 8 years old, I wanted to become someday. As I kept getting older, I started exploring more career opportunities that I could achieve someday and my interest started to grow. With high school and the programs and opportunities that they give us, It is tough to choose between the one I want the most. I wouldnt want to risk any of my hard work into a career that I would end up disliking. With that being said it would be a huge honor if I you could give me the opportunity to visit and get to know about the work that interest me. While many students at my age have already decided what career they want, I am not sure enough to make a decision yet. However, I know that this program will help me decide what is best for me in the future, by learning the skills and requirements to the career I may be interested in. This program would help me sign up for events, classes or even trips to the road of my success. In fact, even by talking to someone with the career I am interested in would help my knowledge. Also, it would help me narrow down between which career I would most likely succeed in. The dedication there would have to be behind getting to where I belong to with your help, wouldnt be a problem at all. With the skills I have already learned with being in high school, I would already know how to manage my time with my career and real life. Your help wouldnt go to waste but would lead me in the right direction to my future. On the other hand, this career might persuade me to become an artist and not to have given up on that dream I once had. I am pretty sure that if you and of course, myself see an improvement in getting involved with music, and having a huge passion, you could help other dreamers like me in the future. Most importantly, by helping them find the right path for them. Once the choice has been made and there has been improvement with the work I have put in and also being sure with what career I want in my future, I would gain more passion and inspiration. This would help me to push until I have accomplished everything I have worked for. I couldnt of made it without this program though, this company could help me a lot if you give me the chance to show you that it would be guiding me in the right path. With the opportunities you give, that not everyone sees, I may become one the greatest artist in this generation. I am hoping you really consider the motivation I have behind this, to do whatever it takes to explore my options out in this world. With that being said, It would be an honor to have the opportunity to explore the options in my career with your help. By leading me in the right path, and by not doing something I am not sure about and letting that go to waste. I would be able to develop the skills you guide me in and also by keeping me on track. The road this company would lead me in would help me become successful. May you please give me the opportunity to suceed? I would love to have your help by keeping me on track to my future.

545,545,8FFDA5B9D359,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I agree with this statement i have three reasons why I think students should be able to attend classes from home. One reason is some students have a alot of responsibilities at home and sometimes students arent able to go to school. Some might have kids and they need to stay home to take care of there kid because nobody can babysit. Thats really hard for a student to do. Trying to go to school and have a kid can be very stressful to the student. My second reason I have for this statement is some students feel comfortable having class in there own safe environment where they feel comfortable and not anxious. There are some students that have anxiety and are not able to function in a classroom full of students that can be really hard for a person because its not easy trying to get your work done in a classroom full of students and dealing with anxiety. That can be very stressfull I feel like a student should comfortable in there learning environment because when they are comfortable they achieve better in there work. They can focus better and get work done and wont be distracted by anyone theres a lot of benefits with that. Parents would also agree that having ther child in a environment that they are comfortable in is the best way to keep there child focused and willing to pass there classes without any distractions that the child doesnt need. My third reason i agree with this statement is students can feel more determined to do there work at home in a quiet place its very helpfull to the students needs to be sucssesful. Some students get distracted easily and cant in a classroom so attending class at home helps the student concetrate and perform better with there work. Another reason is parents would feel comfortable with there child being at home doing school work where they are safe and focused on the right things which is school work. Some students find it easier to do things online than in a classroom so its all about personal prefrence and i agree with this because it could be hard trying to understand what the teacher is saying or talking about. Its good to have a sense of understanding when it comes to learning something thats very important for students. My conclusion to this statement is that i agree and I think it is a great idea for schools to offer this to students because it gives students a chance to be at home and pass there classes with no distractions. It also gives them an oppotunity to sucsseed and graduate. I also agree about doing school online because some students find it easier and better than being in a classroom all day and not being able to understand the teacher. I also like this because you can do your class work where ever you are you dont have to be at home if you have somewhere to be you can take a laptop and do work. I think doing online class works for a busy students schedule its all around is a good idea and I am happy that schools are letting students do online classes its a big benefit for them thats why I agree with this statement. ,8,7,8,8,7,7,1912,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
546,546,2A6F8A794455,"In the journey of life, you will have to do the majority of things by yourself; your family, friends, or team will not always be there for you. Work as a team sounds much easier, but some people take advantage of that; the whole team got a good grade in the project, not mattering if one of them did not work, put effort, or participate, he or she will receive the same grade as her or his team did. Generic_Name, a 17 years old high school student, who always decided to work alone in all of his classes. Everyone in his classroom works in teams, groups, or partners, but he was different; many of his classmates thought of him as a picky, delicate, and rude boy. Generic_Name found inner peace by being in his own, made him felt comfortable, secure, and proud of doing his projects by himself, because when the time to step up in front of the class and explain his topic comes, he would be sure of what he was saying. Sometimes you need to be alone, so you can find your inner friend or skills that you didnt know you had. Some benefits of working alone are that is your own opinion, no one else have to say a word, and even if you are wrong is your own fault that you have to learn and go through it. Lonely means a lot of things, and people take that word in a mean side; sometimes you just do not want to work in groups, because you know that you are capable to do great things on your own, without the needed of selfish, noisy, or stubborn opinions. You can measure yourself, and by working alone you are doing it; you are creating an idea in your mind that is just you and that is how It is going to be in the future, so you are preparing yourself for the future by being working alone.

547,547,F1B4090C8B06,"If you challenge yourself, you will never become good at something you want to do or achieve it. Others believe that challenging yourself wont improve your growth. Its only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now. Going beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After awhile, I wanted to to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth. School is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who has disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes. Ive got out of self-contained classes by making so many improvements to show that I dont need to be in self-contained. Going beyond can make a big difference.

549,549,F3E0762BFA43,Some people say working alone is more benifical. Well I think working in a group is more benifical. My first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. It keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. And it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. Its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. Now days in a classroom were haveing 60 percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. Being in a group helps you raise your voice. Manny Adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. Talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. Making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. My second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. Its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. Having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. My final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. And not everyone is right. But creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. Being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. Your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. You want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. Not being shy or denying yourself wrong. Being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. I belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer. Being in a group helps you become bigger and bold about yourself your trusting you self and your classmate. I believe working in a group is more benificaial rather than working along cecking your self and thinking if your rong and feeling unpositive about yourself.,6,6,6,5,6,5,3615,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
550,550,F93A5B7E57AF,"Being ourselves in a world strongly influenced,manipulated,and corrupted by people. Make a big difference in our lives .This also make us to know, who we are. Because we should not change our personality,our cultures,and how we were educated. Although being like other people make us to socialize easily. Nevertheless, we should not change our personalities. Because our personality is what help us to become our dreams in reality. For example there is a case of two guys who were twins one of them was nice all the time, and the other rude because he was influenced by his friends all the time having even a weird personality, that nobody liked. They attended to the same school their last year in high school, the one who was rude had many problems and one of those problems took him to death, however, his brother who was upset by his death, never stopped being a nice guy and having a great personality,he graduated from high school and attended to one of the best universities in the United States. Additonally having a real personality without any change help us to be more honest with ourselves. I remember last year in my math class my teacher told us to check our assigment by ourselves. In the honor system and I only got six of the ten questions right which was a sixty percent I told her the true and after she checked she gave points extra, she said that I deserved for being honest. In fact our personality gaves us an attitude and help us to be honest with ourselves. Another important reasons for which we should keep being ourselves is because we should not lose our culture. Because our culture makes us special and different to the rest. For example there is a story of a girl who moved from Colombia to Canada where she always practiced her culture even made a club with her traditions that colombian people in Canada visited,so she became famous really fast and made a lot of money. Additionally it is important to keep our culture in anywhere because the culture is an important legacy that children adapt from their parents. One amazing example of this is Leonel Messy a great soccer player, from Argentina, who has been living in Spain for a long time. However he is still practicing his culture and does not change his accent thanks to his family which made him to beloved by all Latin America. Therefore keeping practice our cultures will make our families, and others to be proud of us Also it is important to be ourselves, to show how we were educated. Due to our education is what define by itself how we threat other people. For example on the newspaper was written a story of a guy who teached a long time ago English to his students in a particular way giving them candies when they participated,he never changed his method and all his students got good scores always. Actually our education is most the most need in our life. For example my uncle graduated from high school and ten years after that. He attended to college and the university where he studied languages now he has a family an really good life,but he never stopped being the nice man he was and still being today. in conclusion,we must continue to be ourselves in anywhere, anytime to have a real and nice personality. That will open doors to become our dreams true. Also to keep our culture alive for the next generations. Making our families proud of ourselves. Finally it is important to be ourselves because it shows the way we were educated. Because a good education brings a good life. Therefore being ourselves bring so much good things to our life, that we should not change by the influence of other people.

If you try to do something new, you can grow up because. You can have more opportunities, you can be a professional person, and you can get a good job. First, if you try to do something new , you can have more opportunities. For example, if you are a student and you put all of your effort to graduate from school and also from college then you can prepare to be a good doctor, teacher,police or lawyer.

552,552,36B2E183713B,"People and educators feel like we need to have year round schools, is that a good idea? I feel like we do need to have year round schools. Because when we go back to school most of the students dont remember anything from last year, we would get more days to understand things and remember it. If we start to remember things we did we would not need to have to go over so many things and get to the new stuff for like Math, History, English. The more days were in school we understand the things more and it will stick to us more. Because the more that we start doing in class and we get help with it, we will know what to do when it comes for us to takes test or Sols. Like sometimes when I come back to school I really dont remember what we learned last year or how to do certain problems for math or what ever class it is. But maybe with this year round school thing I might be able to remember these things depending what we learn in class. I think the reason we dont remember things so much is because we really dont pay attention or were not really focused on what were learning. So now with the more days we have maybe we could get a chance to try different teaching methods so the other students can get more attached to what we are learning about and focus more o things in class. Im liking the idea of this year round school, because there more opportunities we can have and more ways so we can focus because of the days were going to have. The only downfall of this is that are summer is going to be less than usually but I mean well get other days off so thats good. Hopefully with this new school thing it will be easier to remember all the information and things we learn. I feel like that the year round school thing could work, it would help out tons of people with remembering things. So there classes could become easier because they would remember what they did last year and know how the problem or question is. It would honestly help me out a lot because I would be able to do more work because I would know how to do the work. I think this would work and be very successful so we can try and see what happens!

553,553,E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change. First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes. Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other markeds prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live. Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it.

554,554,FAA9FC1B315B,In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation. One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills. when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically dont associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldnt be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dontt thing its good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you dont understand and that they should be able to help you. They wont be able to help you if you not there with them. The second reason why I disagree and I really dont think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didnt understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing. Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face thats my second opinion. My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if youre not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way. Those are my good reason why i dont agree with online classes its a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you dont actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation. ,8,6,7,8,7,6,3790,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
555,555,FF6F91DC4170,"What would you do if you fail your online classes? Some schools now offer online classes to make the students life easier. I do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the students parents need to pay internet at home. Also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford. First, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends. Also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. From my own experience, I need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. Even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future. Therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. That is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. For example, my friend Generic_Name she is at the Community College and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. But now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. She told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates. After all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher. For example, Generic_Name was taking online courses because he got sick so he could not attend to school for one year. Then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. He had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. Well, so far I have not take online classes but I take my friends experiences that is not easy. Finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future. Some teachers think that online classes is easier for the students, then attending to school because the students take them own time to study. But the consequences is when the students fail their subject and they had to take it again in school. ""The more the students attend to school. The smarter they grown.""

I think that this club can help so many students who have difficulty with certain subjects like Math, English, or Science. It can also help them get their homework done or any projects that they didnt finish in class. The teachers there can help the students with their work. Also they can work with a friend that is in the club with them. It would be a really fun thing because you get everything done faster.

They can also go to have a little fun with their friends after they are done with all their work that they had. This club can also help you study for a test that youre about to take or something else. They can also just go to play video games if they have no homework to do. I think that the schools should keep doing this club after school because it can help students get their homework done. That way the students can improve their grades that they have in the class. The students should also not be misbehaving while in the club. They shouldnt do any inappropriate things or say anything inappropriate during the afterschool club.

Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who dont want to go school or if they have diseases, they cant go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits. Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students cant learn good like in school. At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents dont let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they cant go to schools because they cant walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school. Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who dont want to go schools because if they dont like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there wont be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they cant learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who dont speak English and they dont want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I cant speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I dont want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends. In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they dont learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school, it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning.

Also I have nothing to go over once I am done because I know I did it all myself and it was done right. Independently I can do more work. whenever I work in groups I get side tracked way more then I usually do. Working alone has become a very common thing for me. I have always preferred to work alone. Working alone lets me work on my own pace. I can work whenever I want too. I have tried to work in groups but they always want to do the last minute type of thing, but when I work alone I do that sometimes too. but i know I got to do it all. I also dont like to keep someone if they did their part. One time I was doing a group power point and two out of four of my partners did not do their part and I ended up failing because of them. When I work in groups I feel like I am doing all the work and my group members are just messing around and not helping me. I have had very bad experiences with groups I have failed many projects, class activates, and labs just because I would trust people on doing the work that they would get when we distributed it. Last week in oceanography my table was doing a lab and I had to do all the work because my whole table group wanted to talk to a whole different table group and not help me. My teacher would not let me work alone even after I told him about the situation. Later I told my guidance counselor and he did not do anything about it either. Every time I have worked in a group I have been side tracked. I can never do anything with someone because i always have the urge to just talk to them and not get any work done. I have noticed this bad habit of mine for a long time now I have tried to fix it but i just can not. Working alone is a very good thin for me i am very productive when I work alone. Working alone is very good for me. I like to do it because then I know that I did all that work for the grade I got not anyone else. I like working for stuff I do not like getting stuff ease. Whenever I work alone I mostly have good time management on all my work. I am mostly always slacking when I work with a group.

559,559,9A9924C0CA97,"Of course the first impressions are almost impossible to change, when you meet with someone, you are waiting that this person can be nice to you, it depens on how you are as a person, sometimes people can make you think good or bad about them , that doesnt mean anything bacuse you dont know how somebody really is as a person until you start knowing about them or start talking with them by any way, you can get information about them from friends or someone who already know this person in case you really want to know about them. It is okay to look over the person you will meet because that way you are feeling sure with yourself about what this person can do or say about you. Your personality is something that can define you as a human. If you want that people talk good about your personality when you meet them, you will have to give good impressions by doing things like saying hi when you arrive to some place, talk about the good things you have done, sports you play or any healthy activities you can achieve. If you are a socialist person you know people will look at your personality when you meet them because they want to know if you are a pleasing person, the minds can change, imporessions never do, even if you know a person for a long period of time, you will never forgot how they was before you meet them for the simple fact that the first time is something that almost nobody can forget. Another reason or example can be when you are looking for a job, you can give good impresions to your probably next boss and the people you will be working with, not just by how you acting it can be by how you are dressing too, your underwear many times can show much about you.",5,5,5,6,7,5,2052,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

561,561,400E5AA27067,"It has been said that first impressions are impossible to change, I disagree with this stiemant. The reason I disagree with this is because first of all first impressions are a snap chat of who you are. Second of all the more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind of who they thought you were from the first time they meet you. At this time of peride people are starting to get the idea that first impressions aret always correct, so they are willing to give a second chance. First impressions are a snap chat of who you are, for me personally first impressions are always heard because based on the few second I spend talking to a person they will always think of me as that person specie if am never going to see them aging. Job interview is a big one because based on how you present your self at that moment of time will determan whether you get the job or not, and you might get nerves and act a sertine way that will not help you get the job even tho thats not who you really are. For example like a year ago I had soccer tryouts for a big soccer team the whole month I have been training and feeling good, but when the day came I was nerves because I never had the chance to tryout for a big team like that. I ended up not getting into the soccer team because the whole time I was worried what time the coaches will think of me and they were not impress with me the first, but this year I made it into the team the coaches liked me because I was much comfortable on the ball this time then last time and the coaches changed there mind about me . What am trying to say is first impressions are not impossible to change. The more time you spend with a person the more likely that they will change there mind, Sometimes you will like person based on for the few seconds you seen them or talk to them, but then when you spend more time with me you come to find out that they are not as much as inserting as they seam. For example I had this kid in my class he was funny and seem inserting. but the more I got to now him i found out that he is funny when they are a group of people around him but when you talk to him one on one he is like a whole different person. This just goes to show that it is not just bad first impressions that are not impossible its the good ones too. People are starting to get the idea that first impressions aret always correct, Job are starting to understand that first impressions are not always correct for that reason they are willing to have two job interviews with. Sometimes it might be first on the phone than in person or just have two job interviews in person and I think that is a good idea spicily for people like me who are not good at first impressions. inconclution, Some people might say first impressions are impossible to change and I can see where they are coming from, but all am trying to say is the more time you spend with a person you are going to have more understanding of who they are. The only time I would say first impressions are almost impossible to change is if you are going to see the person just for one time and never see them aging. If that is the case than what ever the image of you they have that will just be it but be sides that first impressions are not impossible to change.",8,7,7,8,7,6,832,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
562,562,AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you wont have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls arent great because most people arent paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you wont meet any people and you wont learn how to socialize at the end you wont learn how speak to people. The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school. To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you arent at a on campus school,Youre grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you dont go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. Its not fun staying home With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day its still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they arent doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education thats not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they arent using there whole brain to do theyre work. One of the major reason why online classes arent good because you can just google the answers thats just cheating you arent learning its cheating. Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students dont listen or even look at the screen to the call. Its just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you wont have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldnt need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education. The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they wont be able to anything for the future for there education because they didnt pay attention or learn it well plus they wont have any friends to know them. In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.

563,563,04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always. Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes. Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school. Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer. In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable.

565,565,B9F6B348FC3A,"In my experience I dont disagree, that Emerson thing that mastered will never get him grow. First reason, all people get mastered and that stop them to grow in something that they tried to do,For example if you are doing like your own job, and you are the manager you will see all the product that you are selling is going down, and you job its not going well, of curse, you will be in unless to try sell other product and your stored that will happened to you and you stored that you will fell terrible and you will you not valuable to continue in you job because you are so tager to see that you job is going down not going up. Second reason, Mastered is like you are in favor of something and your friend fight to tell you that you are round with what are you trying to do, After your friend try to tell you that you was so round you undated that you was round, them you tried to do the thing right but, you are you get in mastered and that make you to not have other change to tried again, everyone are unless to try something that they already mastered and, something for example you are teenager and you are is school and you did a test and you get bad scored of curse you feel so bad and you will no tried to retake your test again that having mastered . Third reason, being scared to try again something that you love and that you thing if you try again that will be a same way that you did the first time, but went you try again, you will have more experience because you will try to not get the same mistake that you got first time, and will have to look so careful to not get the same mistake because you have more experiences. we all can do the thing many time the thing is that you have to believe in you, and you will look that you will grow not matter how hart and, how many time you get upset, you have to be positive and to be screed if already have mastered. Conclusion,Its that you never give up at what are tried, not matter how many time or change you take you feel that you get in mastered you always will have other change to start and trust that you can believe that you can do it because thats all that you need to start again.

Ralph has a very good point : Lazy, shy, scared people wont succeed or grow as a person or in the work force. Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a at a big company. Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you. You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways. Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isnt motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person wont succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond. One time when i was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff. The most important thing he told me is to do more than what i can already do. Because it will take me places and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When i got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew i was gonna do more in life. Now i work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because i work more than i already mastered. I think working beyond than your comfort zone will help a lot. You can be really successful if you challenge yourself in life.

567,567,D0C50EB5CB1F,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow,"" I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, because he says that if you dont do something you will stay in the same place and never grow up if life, you will not advance, and you conformed with what you have. I believe that peoples always try to overcome in life, thats why you always have to try progress in life and grow up and not be an conformist. because you always can be better in life. We have the ability and the opportunity in our hand. First , never stay where you are, always try to do something else and try to get more experience, always try to overcome in life,because you can always try to be bigger, and bigger,and try to dominate other things because you have the ability and the opportunity do grow up and never give up easily and if you have the opportunity to grow you will do it because never let opportunity get away from you chase the opportunity to be better and to master other things. I believe that you always have the ability to chase your dream and if it is not enough you can find more and you can get to your where your limit is. I think that all people have the potential to follow and surpass them abilities and if you already dominated your, you can find and try another one dont stay with the same one because there are always theres a lot of things inside of us that we dont want to take it out of them but if a person take it out he can do things that non one can believed, because it still inside of them you know that you have capacity for that but you dont want to do it. all people make them own decision but some of them dont know whats them capacity is. Sometimes they dont take the opportunity they just throw it on the trash. Like the feeling of a person they dont fight fort that they can be a big house a lot of money but they cant feel the love that someone has for them thats the one that a person has to recognize they stay in the same place without doing anything they know that they can change that make that happen. But they can change in like and they can grow up. As a person we have to respect each other, make decision on life to grow as a person be a good person in the association take care of my and my family respect my family, be respectful with everyone. Be clean be a good person help someone make a man as a person having good attitude be as good person with my mom. If we make be thinking in this life we ave not gonna grow as a person if we are doing something that we are not suppose to. I think I think that respect is one of the most important part in the world. conclusion In conclusion I think that all people can always finds more opportunity and they can get more experience by doings new things and overcome a new person in life, and chase dream because if they chase that dream they can make it happen for real. I think that all people in this world has the capacity to do things in life but some of them dont want to do it because they just cant, and they stay there without doing nothing, they should chase that dream and never let it go.",4,6,6,4,4,6,2882,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 4"

Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends.

Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework.

569,569,5E3EA4C47C9A,"The author Ralph Waldo Emeson wrote, to be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment . I agree with Emerson statement about individuality because Ive actually seen people end up in big problems tryng to pretend for the world. . In the world we live in we cant even hide from the act because its in out tvs and advertisement . If Im being honest there is no benefit from this whole act of changing for the world in order for them to like you . My favorite rap artist is Tekashie Sixnine who has recently been on the charts and hot 100 in America for his songs . The main reason he got all those views and streams was because he was puttting up a front and prenting to being someone else in his lyrics . This artist has even been also been skating on thin ice for awhile . He has also created and posted on the internet videos of him doing crimes which lead to his arrest in november 20 2018.Tekashie is now serving jail time for trying to prove to the world that he was a big time gangster. My other reason for me to agree with Emerson statement about indivuality was because our lives has changed now that the advertisemnt is telling you change and look a certain way . For example I use instagram every single day and fifthy percent of the time the ads are about weight pills and cool clothes which have gang related logos on it now people buy these clothes and arent even part of gang related activity because the market is influence you to buy it . People can easly fall for the trap thats why you should always be yourself no matter what . Now to my last reason as a human being Ive made mistakes and Ive learned you always have to be yourself from those mistakes. When you are trying to act a type of way the life choices you will be making and friends you hang around will matter . You can be acting for your friends and end up in jail due to to the way yo were acting to make your friends happy. I think its much better to be yourself and too see that as a accomplishement because we are all now in a tech phase were web presents is a big deal and people go at any risk too achieve that goal . I for one can say that it is hard to not act like anyone becuase I came from Canada to america and I didnt change and it benefiting me because I making better choices . These are the reason why I agree with the statement author Ralpgh Waldo Emerson made about individuality .I also think that everone thats trying to achieve something good and do something with their lives should aways keep in mind to be there selfs no matter what .

Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want. The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish. Churchills statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it. The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves. I agree with Churchills statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real. Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job. In conclusion, the Churchills statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",7,6,7,6,6,6,3606,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
571,571,42DB5DABA590,"That older students can assist with the younger students and the younger students can pair up with the older students. I think this way because the older students can help with the subjects of the younger student that dose not know about. And that the older student can learn something about the younger student that he/she does not know about ether. To have more understanding of the old and young student. And to work together as one. The older students have know the past year before the young. They know about the subjects they did and know what to do. This can help the young because when it comes to questions, they can do something about it. They can give examples of what troubles them when it comes to a hard question. To show what feels how hard or easy in class, projects, work, and homework can be. The younger students has a fresh start to 5th grade to middle school or 8th to freshmen. Other students think that middle or high will be easy. Or other think that it will be hard for them self. To open up lockers, find there classes, etc. But by the older students can help them what works best for the student. They can understand of what to do in class. Because of the help of the older students. And they can also teach the other young students of the teaching of the older students. The program can help each other by if they want to be helpful and to work the path to be more easier Maybe something wont be east on work in school. If the student wants to ask questions, to show hints, or how its going to be in the next grade. The program can make everything much more simple.

Because for example right now I am in high schools in eleven grade and I dont know what career I want to take it. I agree with the societies that do students expected to identify a career, at that way they are gonna know what career they want, some students likes more than one career and they dont know which to decided before they graduated.. They are others students that the career that they want it is to expanses and they dont have enough money to pay they can try to get like a scholarship with having good grades and they have to stars in nine grade with good grades and they can apply for one later and see if they can get it. I agree that the students select a career at a young age, at that way they are prepared and when they graduated of high schools that are gonna go to college ad choose a good career, and than after that get a good job.

573,573,4B957C430005,"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I agree that it is the best thing to accomplishment because it makes that person become independent, helps you succeed and gain confidence, and gives you strength to help others out. In addition, being yourself helps you succeed through so much, it helps you become independent to take care of your own actions. Being independent is the best thing why?. Well because its better to accomplish your goals on your own instead of depending on another person you arent going to have that person always by your side. People come and go not really just any person sticks by your side like that. This is why doing things yourself, achieving your goal is the best thing, you can show people that you dont need any ones help because you got yourself and thats all you need. Also, being yourself motivates you to do better, you start to gain confidence and nothing is better than believing in yourself. Just how its easy to gain weight it is also easy to gain confidence by telling yourself I can do this!. By having motivation you can do possibly anything, you can jump off a plane if you have the guts to. You start doing better in school or your job perhaps, you start getting good grades or start coming to work on time. Motivation is key in order to succeed in life you must have confidence. In other words, once you start to gain confidence you need to have enough strength to help another person out perhaps they are depressed or its just not their best time right now. Motivate them to never give up no matter how much stress you have it shouldnt give you a reason to just stop trying. We have to go through the rough times first in order to have a better life. If someone or yourself is having a really harsh time dont be pressed over it the past is the past and many things happen for a reason. I have gone through a rough time myself for 6 months now but it never gave me a reason to give up I am a strong independent woman and I wont ever stop trying to stop having confidence. In conclusion, just how Author Waldo Emerson said To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. He is correct but, also making you into something else could also mean in a negative but we always need to have a positive mindset. We must be independent and have confidence so we can succeed and so we can help others succeed as well to become somebody in life. Never give up just be positive and everything will come your way remember confidence and motivation is key.",7,7,7,6,8,7,987,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
574,574,20CF9410DC4A,"Is a good or bad idea to choose a carrer being young? To begin, in my opinion choose a career being a young student is a good idea because it is a great opportunity for them. Imagine people can choose their profession since their youthness. For example, if they think that they want to be a doctor and at that moment they do not like that profession, they can opt for other career on time. Also, taking that decision many people assure their future, for example if they know what to do when they come to the adult stage, they going to be successful because they going to learn many things since young, and that helps to get better their knowledge. Therefore, doing careers help to people to keep their mind busy in their careers and studying hard and using their time to do good things, like do not using drug or wasting their time being a vandal. As well, if all the people do it, the world will be a place full of privilege, with porfessional people around, having trust and support on each other. To conclude, doing career is one of many opportunities that we have in this country, so we have to use it, because it help us to be good person and get better our skills to be a professional. Furthermore, we have to learn how to focus in really important things. Also, it teach us how to become a successful human and fight for our goals since young. As well, it is good to learn how to be a independant person because if you study hard, your future will be full of success, so you do not need other people to do anything you want.

575,575,D9FA943B5453,"Should schools control the involvement of extracurricular activities, or should extracurricular activities be left to student and their families? Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Extracurricular activities can affect a student but also can help students. Extracurricular activities should be left to the students and their families because students would do something they like, and students will concentrate more in class. First reason why extracurricular activities be left to the students is because, student would be doing something they like. For example, the student chooses a activities they like such as soccer:they would be having fun without stressing out over school or any other problem going on. Many student wouldnt like for the school to put them in a activity they dont like. In fact, many students would prefer to not be in a activity they do not like, than being in the activity they dont like. Second reason why extracurricular activities should be left to students is because, it would make them concentrate in classes more. For example, many activities require to have good grades to be part of it. Student would focus more in class and work harder to get good grades. This would make the student look good but also the school for having students who out reach others. Having good grades is important when being in any other activity because the student would have to manage their time for school,activities, and homework. In conclusion, students and their family should be able to control what the student take or not take. If schools were to control what a student can take student would be who they are. They will also not care about the activity and start not caring about their grades. Student would also be happy and calm not having to worry about something they dont enjoy doing. Students are still growing more and more; the more students we have which means more students to be happy. Student shouldnt be forced to take something they dont enjoy because they wont learn anything from it if they dont like that.",8,7,8,7,6,6,3057,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

578,578,09ADB0629CD0,"Benefits of attending public schools Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel? Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas. Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate. Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer students questions. Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others students opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself. In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel?

Well how can you change someones day by just telling a wis thing, has anyone told you anything that change your life and why you should never give up.

580,580,4A87CFC37238,"I believe that success comes from repeatedly failing but never losing interest on the task youre trying to accomplish. Trying to be successful in a certain task isnt something that can be done over night it requires extreme passion and patience, Certain scientist have been successful over time by failing but always getting back up on their feet and trying again hopefully to do things better. Scientist are driven by their enthusiasm over the life of science and what interesting things you could discover from studying it, their consistency of repeatedly failing and getting back up brought them a long way from nothing which eventually turned into something big for the society over time. For example Christiano Ronaldo the world famous soccer player, Christiano worked very hard to become who he is now which is a world class famous soccer player. Becoming a pro soccer player isnt something that can be done over a couple weeks you have to work your way from the bottom you have to be extremely good to get into a club with years worth of practicing also comes with a lot of failure by not being able to do certain tricks, certain passes, or shots its very difficult to perfect all those tricks or certain shots but that didnt stop Ronaldo from being the best. Soccer took multiple months of training and lots of failing and loosing matches for Ronaldo to get recognized after struggling and loosing Ronaldo eventually carried his team to multiple wins with tremendous skills, therefore soccer clubs came out to watch his games and soon he was offered a spot to play pro soccer, He worked his way up to becoming the best soccer player anyone has seen. Most people in the world think failing is a bad thing and eventually give up after time, because of the lack of passion they have towards their task so tend to give up and move on with another task. The majority of our society are becoming more and more lazy over time which leads them push away all their work away for another time, therefore its less of a chance for them to do bigger and better things in life like everyone wants. Some rappers, multi millionaires, and professional sports players became high school drop outs who worked at fast food places to get money to get through their day but they never gave up on what they loved the most regardless on how broke they were or how many problems they had they going on in their lives they never gave up on the thing they loved the most, they thought that one day they were gonna make it to the top and have a better life than they were living they never let go of that passion no matter how hard they had failed they always got back up and tried even harder than the last time. Eventually, all that sweat and hard work they had put into what they were passionate about they got recognized more everyday which made them want to do much more in life, be better person from what they were yesterday.

581,581,244973AE9715,"Many people are kind and do parts in helping others , what they dont know is , the act of kindness either received from or given to someone has a big impact no matter how small or big . Reasons an act of kindness can really benefit someone are , the person might have a better day just because of your kindness , the person might learn from your act of kindness and lastly , a good act of kindness can come back to you from the person who you helped . The first reason of how kindness can impact a person is , the person whom you helped might have had a bad day or , you never know what someone is going through , they could have a hard life and are hiding it . The person who received the act of kindness might have bad a bad day or life , your kindness could have made that person feel so much better and worthy. Some people dont often receive kindness , you might have put a big smile on their face or , made their day much better . You can be seen as a person with good characters and manners , people can always depend on you if you are a kind person and do a lot to help make someone feel better with words or actions everyday , most people would appreciate you if you did almost anything to help them or make them smile because again , you never know what someone is going through . For example , I partnered up with a girl in our math class , she was crying for some reason and nobody wanted to be her partner , when I told her if she can be my partner , she said yes and sounded really happy when I said . I , of course told her what was wrong , she told me she was going through a lot at home and nobody wanted to be her friend in school , I was devastated to hear that . I told her she can be my friend and for the rest of the day she smiled and laughed . The second reason any act of kindness , big or small , can impact a person is , the person receiving the kindness can learn from you and make themselves a better character too , you can influence a person with how you act , if you act kind and generous and , make good choices , someone is gonna learn from your words and actions . Same with if your a person who is just rude and makes bad decisions , someone else , will learn from your actions . Many people tend to learn from people in their environment , especially young people , so if a young person sees you offering a kind act of helping to either them or someone else , they can learn from your actions and see you as a big role model , people should always make good decisions for many reasons one being that young people can benefit from your choices and will always look up to you for being the person to guide them through life , many people make bad decisions around children but if you do an act of kindness , to them or someone else , young kids will automatically learn from you . For example , one day me and my little sister were in the park , playing with our friends , we saw an old lady all of a sudden drop her apples , I immediately went to the side walk and helped the lady , I picked up the apples and put them in a safe and clean bag . The old lady thanked me and told me , ""youre well mannered , thank you for your help , I appreciate it , may god bless you"" , I smiled and said ""your very welcome"" . The next day as I was going to the bus stop , to pick my little sister up from school , my little sister ran to me and said ""I sat next to this new girl in our school who was being bullied . I even shared my lunch with her because, she did not have much food at home to bring to school "" . I was delighted to hear her story , I told her why she did that , she responded ""when I saw you helping the old lady yesterday , I realized how nice you were and how happy the lady was , I decided to do something similar "" . The third reason of how an act of kindness can benefit someone in many ways is , the good act of kindness can come back to you . For example , one day , a girl in our class came late to school , we were in our social studies class , she came and sat down and asked people if she could copy the notes , all of my classmates shouted ""NO"" . I went up to her and gave her my notes . She was happy and said thank you , when she finished copying my notes , I went to my seat . About a week later , we were having a contest in our school , whoever won would receive a prize . I sadly did not have any knowledge of the topic for the contest . The next day , I partnered up with the girl who copied my notes , I told her about how I wanted to win the contest . She looked happy and told me she knew all about the topic , she said she could help me and I replied with , ""I would appreciate it so much "" . I went to her house after school and taught me all about the animal , we needed to have certain knowledge of the animal to do the contest in our school . The next day , I did the project and the next day ,I winned .I thanked the girl . In conclusion , any act of kindness can benefit a person , you might make them smile , make them learn , or , the act will come back to you.

Now a days, if you will go outside, in many places you will see that there will be friends or family sitting on the same table but no one is talking with each other, everyone is on their devices. There are many people in todays world who do suicide or are in depression just because they think they have no one to whom they can talk and can share their problems. For example, if there is some one is trying to talk to you and is trying to be your friend but you are busy in using your phone and the next day you came to know that the person who was trying to talk with you yesterday did suicide today because that person thought that he had no one to whom he can talk. So you will blame yourself and you will regret at that time for not talking with that person. Hence, people should interact with each other more and more and they should try to know about each other life intead of using their devices all the time. People should spend more time with their families because not everything is found on Google,there are somethings which you learn by spending time with your family and your family will be the only one who will be with you every time, in your good and bad days, but your devices will not be with you and also they will not support you at that time.

583,583,C1959178FC53,"According to Thomas Jefferson: ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" What he wanna said is that if we are always working and never have free time we will accomplish so much more. We could see that why he is saying this because he is a hard working man and look at what he have done to the world, there is nothing wrong for working hard. But if we are always working and dont spent time for ourselves or time with family then you could accomplish more but you will suffer a lot more for that successful. For example, when we work hard and dont spent time for our self or we dont have any private time to relax and stop thinking about work, we will get stress and stress led to a lot of thing like cant sleep at night,depressed,or maybe cant eat well. So we definitely have to manage time well between work and time for yourself to maintain doing good work and have a good and healthy life. Like another scientist that work hard like Thomas Edison, his name is Albert Einstein, he work really hard but dont manage time well so he have barely sleep a day. Some even said he only sleep 3 hours a day, and the consequence is he died at the age of 60 because of sickness and he even have autism when he stay awake for too long and talking to his own self. That is why we have to have free time because we dont want to get stress and get tired of our work so it can led to quit job or we getting fired. Another important thing is that we need to spent time well with our family too because family is where we have the most support from and also the reason why we work for so hard if we dont have time for our family then they will leave us and then, by that time we gonna work and live so hard because we are lonely. And we might suicide or getting depressed and lead us to drugs. Family is what matter in our life and that is why we have to spent good time for them so they can be with us and support us when we need to so we can work harder for. I have an uncle in Generic_City, he is a successful business man, he work for a well-known medical company and and owner of a market but to pay for what he own is his time for his family. He start work at 5 a. m and go home at 11p. m and he never have time for his family. That is why during this summer his wife leave him, his daughter dont wanna see him anymore because he was never there for her, and his son just never call or visit him. Now he is 40 and he is a very success person but after all of that he is still and lonely old man. This is why we need to spent time for our family because after we work so hard in our lives but we dont have family after that we are just lonely peoples that have no one to make our life happy til the rest of it. i think Thomas Edison quote have nothing wrong with it, and it is true that human can do so more if they are not have idle time. But if we dont have those idle time we will soon face with stress, disease, depressed, loneliness and also suicide, so why we work so hard and dont have free time so we die in miserable ways when we can work hard and play hard too and enjoy our life in a really good way.",6,6,6,6,5,6,2609,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

I personily believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think its head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they cant graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill. Most of the students dont want to take a courses during the summer because they want to have free time , they dont want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They dont want to work for schools on summers. Theyre some family who love traveling with theyre kids. Most of the students want to take a elective courses but not in summer. Couses whay want to take is art, muise, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as a elective courese can help them in college or in work force. Some of the elective courese that students take can help them find out what they like or dislike. Overall my position on this issue is that schools should offer a four years hight schools, instead of three years because its can hlpe students to get ready for college and work.

585,585,C49F716838E7,"Should students attend to year-round schools? Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students. In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job. For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school. It was not easy being their because me and my brothers did not know much Spanish but know is are first language. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year. After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. It was so much better being in a normal school because I had more time in school vacation as a student, also had a summer job, and more time for me and family. Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do. In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together. But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life. In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons.

586,586,E2687856AA7D,"School districts should not allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Those programs force the students to take summer or evenings courses, dont allow them to take elective classes, or students might not have the time that they need to be prepared for college. This information can help students to think more about their decitions, and have a successful life. Summer, or evening courses can always be stressful for some students. Sometimes, they will not have time for family activities, or they might not have the opportunity to get involved in sports that they like, which is a good way to spent time with other students. It is also very important to know that students need time to rest, a free time when they can sleep and release the tiredness. The elective courses during the school year should be available for all the student that wish to improve their knowledge. For example, learning other kind of things can encourage students to think about more ideas for their future, and develop new skills on many activities. Taking away the opportunity of students to choose any of elective courses, and forcing them to complete all the hard classes that they need is not a good solution. That will make students to force themselves to do hard work, which can end up in a failing situation. In other words, its very important for students to be prepared for college. Also students should have the sufficient time to prepare, and choose the career that they really want. If in case students are not sure about what career they want, four year of High School should be enough time to learn more about carrers. For example, students will have more opportunities to attent college day also, they could go visit, and get information about any college that they are interedted on. Being well prepared is the best key to bulid a good future nad accomplish dreams. This decition should be made by the school district to eliminate this programs, and let the students have a comfortable schedule for thier everday activities. spending more time at home with family, and refreshing their minds its better than summer courses. Students should know that getting involved in elective classes is more fun, and bieng well prepared for college is more important. Even though students know its going to be a longer way, it would benefit them in the future. ",8,8,8,9,9,7,3251,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

588,588,253B2D521F14,"Do you think starting a career at a young age is good? Many students think that starting a career at a young age is good, but its is not a good thing for them or in general. Students often choose to start it at an early age because they could be really excited about it. I think that them focusing on their studies until they get older is even more better, and it would be a great thing to do. And instead of the young students hanging out with their friends at somewhere thats unrelated to their career or studies, they should maybe go to a tutoring center or help each other. Students should also have time to think about and choose a career that they think they would focus on really well. If students start a career at a young age, it can have quite many consequences. Usually doing so would make them more likely to have failure in their career, lack of some education, and they wont get much respect from people. One of the reasons why I think that students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age is because they will more likely to have failure in their career. If they have failure in their career, there will be many problems. One of the problems that could happen is that they could get sued if if they end up doing something wrong. Another thing that could happen is that they could get many complaints about things. And if people complain about them and if they make bad reviews about them, it will make their image look bad. And for that they might not be making a lot of money out of their profit, because people know what failures they are. Another reason why I think that students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age is because they will lack some education. If they lack some education, they wont be able to know a lot about their career. Its just like a chicken is running to get to the other side of the road with his head cut off. One thing they will also have trouble in is interviews. They will not be going to get success if they dont know much. And if they dont know anything about their career, that person could get fired. One of the things that they would also be doing is making a lot of mistakes. The students should stay much longer in school to get proper knowledge of that career so that they will earn success. Another reason that students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age is because they wont get respect as much as a well educated person that knows all their studies and who knows a lot about their career, if they do so. People would probably ask them that why didnt they take their studies further. Also, and what they couldve done before to fix this situation is that they couldve gotten help from others such as their friends, teachers, by staying after school for extra help, or asking their parents to hire a tutor. Additionally, or what they could do instead of getting extra help, is that they could just focus in their career class and not slack off. They should also do a career that theyre interested in. Because a lot of the times when they see that one of their friends chose this one career, then they will do the same one. Thats why young students should always think and choose very wisely when it comes to picking career. Young students should focus more on their studies and shouldnt commit to a career at a young age. They should all focus, and they should keep studying until they get much older, rather than choosing a career at a young age. It is also a very important to not have failures and mistakes in your career, so that your career turns out to be good. I think that young students should always study, and never lack any sort of education. Also, and that they should get the most of education to gain much more of peoples respect. By doing all of these things as a young student, they will achieve great success. By them not doing these things, they wont get much of their career success.",8,6,6,7,8,8,492,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
589,589,D8532CCFE454,"Yes I identify with churchill and his statement that for us to reach what we want, we have to pass for a lot of things. For us to be able to achieve our goal, it doesnt matter if our goal is a short goal or a long goal, first of all we have to pass some difficulties to be able to reach the goal that we want. If we want to see the results of success in our life we never have to loss the enthusiasm on it to be where we want it to be. To reach the porpose that we want is something fantastic because only the person that fight for them know what they have had to pass to reach the goal. How can we be a support for does people that need help to reach their achievements, but for our on self is difficult to give us a impulse to reach our own goals. The things in this life are hard nothing is easy, but not impossible. What can we do for us, so we can always have the the enthusiasm high, so we can have the decisition to tell our self we got this. Sometimes there have to be a person to give us a shove to undestand that we got it. In my opinion and I say this because this happen to me all the time, I give out advice , I help those people that dont believe on there selfs no more, give them a word to push them to keep goinginto the get it and tell themnever put there self down. Every single one that have complete a goal have had to pass on problems, that you have problemts doesnt mean that you are on the way to give up, to throw everything you have done at this point. Those problems, those failure you have had are helping you to bild your character, to change the way you see life to see the things with other prespective. I never heard someone saying that reaching something is easy, fast or simple. To be successful is something hard, its a huge feeling to get your own respect that you can do it. Being successful is something difficult to overcome, the reward is amazing. It is a nice thing to see everything whta we had go over to get where you at is just for the effort that you put on it. Is a bless to go forward in life tellingpeople how to do, what to do so they can get a advice from you to be a successful person, to try very hard to achieve their goals. In conclusion to be a winner require to pass all difficulties that life give out. Those failure are horrible but at the end of the day of the day you will understand why did it happen. Whene you get along very well you would say now I understand how to haddle out this problems. Like i said before to achieve something is like get out of the something and enter to other failure. when the years pass out you will have create anew version of your character, personality that you construct, this new person will have the capacity to make the hard esay. In my opinion I believe that getting or achieving our goals consist on a route of failure, problems, difficulties, ect. The things that are up on the hill those that are hard to reach are the great ones, the right ones. ",6,5,7,5,5,5,3022,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
590,590,915D8BF74963,"Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become. First off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that youre a head. People who dont know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college theyll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. He also told me, It wasnt easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon youll be proud or yourself. Secondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc. But thats only what they have to face. For the people who dont know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didnt think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. Its better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time. Lastly, having to learn different careers is good, but itll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. But just knowing one career youll be able to focus on that specific career. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. Its better to have a head start from everyone than being last. Therefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon itll be too late.

And if we make it longer there are going to be parents that are going to be waiting for there child to take them to the football, soccer games and then when they come home its going to be late beacause like they want to change the hours they are not going to have enough time to do anything there going to go home to homework and then when you know it it arleady like 8pm and you have to go to bed. And we arleady wake up at 7am and then coming back home and its like 5pm-6pm its stress out kicking out stuff that you do but now you cant to beacause they put more time in School.

597,597,A2EF5BCC488B,"Some people think that when they master at something theyve never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, Ive been continually practicing using these tools, and now Im an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it. Another reason why Emersons quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something youve neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much Ive eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and its still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this. In contrast of Emersons quote, if people keep practicing, but they dont seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it. As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something youve never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",6,7,8,7,8,7,2183,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

599,599,E4C49D70C330,"What would happen if the school menu is change? Most of the kid will be upset because the menu have all the delicious food they like. This does not mean this food is healthy. United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol. Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app. All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol. In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse. A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat. One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza. This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body. And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future. In my opinion considering being part of the school community and thinking about my future and my classmates I think that including a more healthy menu in the school cafeteria would be one of the best ideas for everyone.

600,600,E07B043F3C2B,"People should seek guidance for help, because like us are still having trouble in the real world even if we graduate from high school or college, we even still have trouble trying to make our live easy. Having guidance is always helpful and learn something new. Reason to have guidance is to release stress or dont add more stress. In daily hours people get stress out a lot at work and could get out of the control very easy,getting help from another one is good idea so you know what you doing and how you doing it. People stress things out and they dont know about what causing it, that give even more stress and have a chance to get an heart attack and lose motive to do work. Guidance could help us by rethinking our plans or working. While taking a guidance you could learn more things that we didnt know of. Having guidance will also help you keep tack in time and help everything more clean in your work space. It good idea to have an open mind and have work done easier and fast. Having an open mind can give a good mind set in life and think more a head in time and saving time. Another reason is people have depressing life or have health issuer. Depressing is a big thing that come to life in everyone and it cause a lot problem the way they living. Most of the population on earth have depressing in their life, so it a good idea to seek help at all time. People who having that need get some help from guidance right away to tell them what going on in their life, it could help them cure their depressing. It a bad idea to to let people guide they own way without any help at all, because trying teach yourself is hard enough, and try to teach yourself might get even more worst because they mind might be wrong and could cause more problem in later runs. People rather do it on their own and not get help because it might give them false inform that they need to learn or think it a waste of time, but guidance are here to help. Having guidance will always help you and they always teach you more things. People can still guide on they own way, but it better to get guidance. It be more easier and get better in live in the long run.

601,601,FC0B49DA0438,"There are so many ways of influences people and i think the main one is to set an example by your own character. I agree with Philosopher, physicain, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer saying that ""Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people."" For instance, most people look up to others to better them self by using thier action or behavior. First and Foremost, you having a better behavior help others reflect on you to better their self. Mostly, student or collegues look up to pass student who had accomplished something good and make them determined so they can also achieve something by taking hard classes to pass. Due to the pass student behavior on thier education who set an impact on others telling them they can do it. Is kind of having them as their motivator. I look up to people behavior and tell myself i can be more than that person due to his behavior. Most of them, encourage me to be who i want to be and to achieve my goal. Secondly, it leads them in the right path and it depends on thier action. Your action towards your behavior matters, It depends on how you act towards a good behavior. If your action are good towards a good behavior it leads to the right path. Emmulating someones behavior or action can help you be in the right path. Most of the times we look up to people who have or had been who we want to be and then pick thier footsteeps by learning from their good behavior. For example, looking at Lebron James, famous basketball player, looking at his games played can help you to be motivated and lead you to the right path of your goal. Looking up to a famous person and following his footsteps emmulating his behavior set a good example to others. In Conclusion, setting a good behavior or example kind of influence people so they can be on the right path and kind of know to set up a good behavior for someone else to follow. I take the stand and agree with Phiosopher saying Is setting a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people.""",6,6,7,5,6,7,3816,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Guiding other will make people believe in what you are saying and that will make you feel great because you are teaching other what you have been taught. Influencing others can make others listen and hear what you have to say and then share it with others. Sharing there thoughts will guide people to doing good things in there lifes. Like buying stuff when they are old enough to. So when they go somewhere they would already know what there are doing. Sharing there thought will help people to doing great thing in there life even though life is not always perfect you will have to make the best out of it.

604,604,C465964DA6D5,"Do you think that you need to fail over and over to become success. In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better. When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldnt do any better. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. Thats what make a person successful. Failure is something that all of us do. Thats what make us do better in life. If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. That why we have become successful in something in are life. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldnt ride a bike. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. I try doing different way to learn. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better. My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years. All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he dint do what the customer said. Some times was because the customer dint like the work. Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said. Some people said that you dont need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better. In the future, I hope people learn more from their failure to be successful in what they want to archive in their life.

611,611,B106E3896C56,"well to start off i do agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on what he wrote because in my postion for me it is true like he said ""unless you try to do somehting beyond what you have already done"" you need totry and see how it works out and if you are succesful with it then you master it even more bigger to become even more bigger so that is why i agree with what Ralph Waldo wrote. one reason why i agree with Author Ralph is beacuase it is true once you mastered somehting you can also do something beyond like bigger. so that is one reason why i agree with what he wrote second reason why i agree with Ralph Waldo when he says ""unless you try to do something"" which i think its true if you try to do something and u make a mistake you can keep trying like lets say you go to collage and you failed 3 class and you give up which its not a good idea because you will make mistakes in life not all the time but sometimes so that is what i think when he says ""unless you try to do something"" means like you at least need to try once and see how it goes. thrid reason is he says you will never grow and what he is trying to say is that if you master somehting beyond that what you have already acomplished and you go more bigger then you will grow because you did somehting on your own and bigger so that is why i think there is a thrid reason. These are all the reasons why i agree with waht he wrote and why i agree with him like i said you ned to try to bigger things in life and become more succesful and get more better things have what you want like buy a car a house and go on vaction with your famliy and like i said for reason two i said if you try and make a mistake you need keep on trying and become a better person. so that is what i think about what he wrote and why i agree with him.

612,612,FD98A503573E,"Do you think that a positive attitude is the key to success in life? some people said that positive attitude can help you in life. positive attitude is the key to success in many ways in life. I agree, because in many opportunity that you will have in life, is that you will know a lot of people in life with out positive attitude. One of the most important things that a person can have in life is positive attitude, if you are one of those persons with positive attitude, you will get more opportunity around the world. In my own opinion positive attitude can help many people out there in life, having positive attitude can help a lot in the person. Example: when you go to work, if you have positive attitude you feel good all the time, also you will be able to talk with your friends in a way that you would not affect someone around you. Those who have a positive attitude you will success in life. Example in my family, my grandparents has been successful in life only with positive attitude, they always have faith in the things that they will do, also one of my grandfathers said that all you need in the world or in a the work area is positive attitude, if you had that you will get all you want. in many opportunity that you will live in real life, is when you are ready to do something but you are not sure to do it, thats where you will put your positive attitude to do it on own place i would said that having good attitude is one of the best things that a human can have good attitude would give you more opportunity, when someone with positive attitude wake up at the morning the first thing that they do is smile at the mirror. Positive attitude is a good thing to have but, some people with out positive attitude they think different in a way, that they dont know what are they are doing to be as the person that have positive attitude in life. In the future positive attitude is going to be one of the most important thing around the world and also in your life. conclusion if you have a good attitude you will successful in life.

613,613,3E7DE9C1C160,"What lesson would you chose to teach elementary school students? Would you chose math because they like numbers, or science because they like playing with science experiments. I would chose science, because we use science every day by turning on a light, to throwing a ball up in the air. Another reason many students like science is because it is the most fun, by that I mean by all the experiments we do in science. One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life. Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it. For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments. Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students dont get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand. Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you dont know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life. In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?

614,614,5E830B6462DB,"Thomas Jefferson believes in that doing something is better than doing nothing. We do accomplish more if we always do something. There are great accomplishments and there are simple accomplishments. If I wanted to play an instrument, but i dont know how, so I learn how. Lets say I want to see other dementions worlds, or go back in time. Lets say I build a machine to be able to do that. Cleaning the house, Cooking a meal, and doing homework. If we are always doing, then we can accomplish. We accomplish more by doing something. If we didnt we wouldnt have the things we do now. We can accomplish things as a team or individually. Like sports, in sports people work together to win. A game company, these people work together to make a game, so that people can play it. In a game people play together online to win as a team or individually. Its better if we do our work, homework, or even little things like play outside, hangout. Inactivity in its own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something. So we do what we have to do for a couple of hours, we go home, we can take a nap, eat, watch a bit of tv, or sleep. That way the next day you can be motivated to continue doing your job, or go to school. If we do even a little during the day weve accomplished like go out and buy groceries, clean the house, and cook. If you do that then youve accomplished something. you cant really do anything if you sleep all day. Being lazy is not good. Its bad, because if we get lazy then well want to have the easy way out of things all the time. We can get used to at being lazy.

615,615,DE56AA9B4BF1,"Every students desperately waits for the weekends. Because they hate all the school days. But believe me, adding one and a half hours to schools will be beneficial to all the students for their future. The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day because the students can learn more, they can use their time wisely, they can improve the understanding skills of the students. The school board should add one and a half hours to school day because all the students can learn more. A long time period can make all the students to get a good knowledge about their chapter or topic, So, most of the students might started to get good grades on their tests. The students can take their time to do their own work. So, all of them can discuss about their projects. Sometimes the students can finish their homeworks during the class periods. That might save the time for everyone. Firstly, the students can get some more knowledge is a reason why the school boards should add one and a half hours to school each day. Another reason is, all the students can use their time wisely in the class. The students will be more into their study at that time rather than their phones. So, the time will be more useful to them. The students can finish their all work in the class. So, they can get some extra time to spend with their family and relatives. Sometimes, the students can get some extra time to read books. And that can improve their reading skills. Secondly, using the time properly is another reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. Although, some people may argue that, adding one and a half hours to school each day is stressful to all the studens. But, believe me or not, all the teenage students are always on their phones. So, it isnt a bad idea to add one and a half hours to school each day. At least, they cant be in the touch of their electronic devices for one and a half hours! Lastly, for a better understanding skills the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day. The teachers can explain the chapter or the topic by taking their time. So, the students will understand the chapter more better. The students will be more responsible and the teachers will teach the students with a good understanding level. That will be more beneficial for the whole class. Good learning or understanding skills is the last reason why the school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. Adding one and a half hour to school is beneficial to all the students for their future. Because they can learn more about their topic, their time will be used more wisely for them, they will understand the subject better. The students will finish their work in time. they can read books, they can discuss about their projects and stuff, the teachers will get some extra time explain the errors or problems.

Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

617,617,2EEB160A4BD1,"85% of people think that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has been said that people who have a great attitude have more opportunity to sucess in life than people who have a negative attitude. However, some people may think that a good attitude is not always necessary because there are job that doesnt required a positive attitude. Having a good attitude can help you to find a job, make new friends and help you to archieve your goals. For example, it can help you to find a job and if your job required to comunicate with others people your attitude will make people to like you, also your manager will like how you work and how you treat the costumers. Furthermore, your attitude can make you the best employer in your job and help you to find a better job. In addition, a good attitude can make you find new friends and they will always want to talk to you or be all the time with you even if they dont feel good they know you can make them happy because you have a positive attitude that they like. More over, you could only have friends that have a great attitude like yours because people that have a negative attitude would not like to have you as a friend because you are always happy. To archieve your goals you may need to have a good attitude because when you dont feel good and you dont want to continue trying your attitude will help you to never give up and continue trying until you archieve your goals. When I dont want to continue in high school and I just want to get a job I like to have a good attitude and think about my goals and how far Im right now and that help me to make me happy and to not give up. In other words, your attitude is really important in your life not everyone has a good attitude and not everyone think that attitude is important, but a great attitude can help you with many things like to make good decisions, to be a better person, and to make people love you.

618,618,C6EB01B2D6B8,"MY SCHOOL SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THIS MODEL BY EXTENDING THE SCHOOL DAY BY TWO- HOURS The addition of two hours to the school day will benefit the school poorly but, will cause a huge disadvantage to students and the school as a whole. The four - day work week will not be beneficial to my school because, it would reduce the amount of time students have for other activities, and also this will result in the inability of students to learn more, and as a result students are affected mentally and psychologically. To begin with, the school day has been designed in a special way which gives students, a reasonable amount of time to involve themselves in after school activities. These activities help the students acquire other skills different from what we acquire in school. For example, students who also take part in sports do not have enough time to practice or train after school if these 2 hours are added. Other students who work after school will begin to work fewer hours because they also need time to study and revise. As a student, time is needed to attain your goals and time also determines your future. In addition to, the student brain cant function as well as an adult brain after some hours of serious work .The brain becomes tired and needs rest after some time, but the adult brain can do more because it is well developed than the student brain. After lunch, the students can study to a maximum of 3 hours only before feeling sleepy or tired and if these hours are extended, students will feel reluctant to study, which makes these extended hours a waste of time. Due to this, students wont take these hours seriously but will only disturb or disrupt the class which produces no positive result at the end of the class. The school makes sure that wastage of time is extremely prevented to produce positive outcomes and results. Furthermore, to become a successful student, individuals must be mentally upright and psychologically sound to allow learning to be much easier and convenient. If these 2 hours are added to the school day, the students wont be mentally stable because, they would be stressed from pushing themselves to learn more even tho they are tired. Psychologically, this will reduce a students ability to understand new things being thought and also prevents them from revising past information or work given. If this is happens, students will begin to forget past information and how to apply them which will become a problem in the near future. Conclusively,this four - day work week would benefit other other institutions but wont benefit an institution like my school because my school works and remains successful mainly by the use of precious time and effort.

623,623,F66B2BAB7E4C,"Do we choose our own behavior or is it controlled by other influences. Well it all has to depend on the type of person you are. For example if you are somebody who gets influenced by other people then you are going to act like those people. And usually those people are bad influences, but if you are somebody that chooses to be who they are then that is really who they are. And mostly it is to be nice to others, and those are some reasons why it can go either way, but for me i personally think you have a choice to be who you desire to be without any influeces. When you get to be who you want to be life is easier. You are going to be true to yourself and people will have respect for you. And many people all over the world are scared to be themselfs, and would rather get controlled by other people. And because of those type of people they spread that nagative influence off to other people that get controlled easily. But in the end it depends on who you hang around with. Choosing the way you act is very important not just for you but for your future. Because your future is what matters at the end of the day. And because of that reason is because if you want to find a good job you have to be respectful and kind. But if you didnt have a good attitude then nobody wont hire you. Its reasonable too, because nobody wants a bad attitude person in their jobs. Many people who have chose their characters have been successful because of it. And cause they have confedenced they can achieve anything they want in the world. And all that just because they went on to be themselfs. Meanwhile those who have been influenced by others have been stuck like that their whole lifes. Depending on what type of influences they get, because some are good and they get to high places in life. So at the end of the day as long as you choose something that is good for you and wont take you to bad places you will be great in life. But unfortunally it usually ends in bad places for those who are weak and would rather take influences by others who are in bad situations. And thats why for me it is better to choose to be yourself then to follow others. But if you are somebody that likes the influences then choose people who are good. That is how i see it in my eyes.

So one of the reasons you should invite me for job oportunities is because unlike the rest of my partners at school they dont have the spirit of a fighter like I do, because I always try to give it all Ive got because I know this is my heart and like my dad told me ones if ""if you dont fight for it dont expect for the things that you want to come for you"", and to prove myself that I can be someone on this world having a good job and be respected for it,so I can be able to support myself and my family as well, work hard in every little single thing I do is what I have to make sure that I can be capable and responsible of doing it. In the other hand lets say that at least for now I want to graduate from high school, then go to college to start a career of mechanic, because mechanic is the number one on my checklist in other words my favorite, however this is would it be a big opportunity if you actually choose me for the job opportunity, because as it is for me this is going to be a really good starting for me, after all I think I can show you what I mean by saying I dont give up because my father always told me when I was a little kid; no matter what happens after I had to give it all, never leave a little bit of what I could let on my effort, also because he is been a great example for me since I was a kid or since I remember my childhood. Instead of being a bad boy, he showed me what do I have to to with my values and things that really matter to me, so that is pretty much of what I can be capable of when it becomes to a responsibility. Persistent is other word that goes with my personality, if you want someone who really want to do something when it becomes to work, I think I might have the qualities that you are looking for any kind of job. So thats my response to what you might be looking for, i just hope that you can choosr me, Thanks. ",6,5,7,6,6,7,3743,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
626,626,8D1CD79C0F8D,"Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I was so successful in life. You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy. First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name. Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Names makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese. Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him. You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something. Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and I benefited from always doing something productive instead of being inactive. Help me spread the word that always doing something is more beneficial and healthy than being inactive.",7,5,7,7,7,7,1876,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

628,628,75C950F8EA18,"Sucsses is the common word that we hear every day, and everyone want to became successful in their life. The first step of a person toward sucsses is school, and it is the golden part of our life, and to make it more enjoyable and comfortable for a student, school and teachers let us do some educational and exciting drama role plays, do a funny science experiment, and let them play their favorite instrument. Today, we got some talented actors,comedians, actresses and etc, but they were also students in a time and were sitting on the chairs that we are sitting now. They did their best, try hard, participate in role plays in school, and now we can see were are they now. We can also reach there, and a best way to reach there is to participate in role plays in school, and improve our self from now. However, participating in role play is really fun and enjoyable. Role playing make us improve our daring to stand on podium and represent our self, and improve our emotions. By doing role play we can make people happy, and making someone happy is the biggest joy. The technology and science has developed a lot and experiments are done day by day, and no one wants to stop these experiments. So for that now we want students to learn how to do experiments, and to make them more attractive toward science, we give them some fun and safe experiments such as:making rainbow in air, mixing colors or maybe disappearing coin, which increases their attention and focus on science, and it is actually fun to do these, and our big reason to do this is they are the future. Every student has got a hide talent in their self such as; some students can play music, may draw, or maybe athletic, but these talents are not hidden for always these talents will get appeared sometime. The most popular talent among students is music. Because music directly touch your heart, and make you focus on it. Music have a lots of types it could be happy, sad, angry and etc, and it make you feel like that. We hear music everywhere on TV, in music class,and etc. When we hear music we get our emotions out and make our mind light, and we enjoy that. At last, I think school is a place of learning, if someone want to learn something he always enjoy everyclass and get something learn from it. We should always enjoy at school and learn something.

629,629,C40BB9E0BC6C,"Should success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. l agree with what Churchills about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Failure is to do or perform. l agree because some people think that if you are failure it mean you can not be success, you will be success no matter what. Some people preform good in ever where they go and do what will make they there success so this is important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success without loss of enthusiasm. First reasons, ln the world people will say that failure dont make they life by success so if they did something and they fail that all, they will never try it again because they did not get good thing from the fist one. Be strong in everything you are doing failure will not be without loss of enthusiasm. For example My brother wife have an exam to write in the morning so she was learning all the night she did not asleep so l went to her room and tell her to sleep some time before morning and she said no l have to learn so that l can pass me exam and l said OK then am going to sleep. ln the morning she get up and she went to write the exam. The next day they call her and told her that she fail her exam so all what she was thinking was that she will pass the exam but she will failure so she was thinking that she will be success in this exam but she did not loss of enthusiasm. Also, Most of the people give up if they fail in thing they are doing they believe in them self that what they are doing will be successful for they but the end thing will miss up for them and the loss of enthusiasm the good ideas of bring success tell your that l can do this and do it all. For example, l was write am SOL exam last year and l dont know what to write and l dont understand what the question is say so l was thinking about the question but l dont know what to write so l tell my self that no matter what the question is l will do it and pass it. When the score came because l believe in my self l pass the exam. So you can be success in every thing you do if you made up your Maine in what you are doing. Make your self a good discuss and you will be fine. However, Some people start their own business but they first tell them self my business will be successful and yes they will be because they believe first before they start the business. Yes the work will be good without loss of enthusiasm. For example, My friend dad has a big shop in Generic_City one night when her dad was asleep some bad people came to the shop to take all his money and the thing in the shop so in the morning people was cry infant of the shop so we all went there l see what is going there so when we went there it was so sad they bad people took everything in the shop not even a pen but do know something he did not give up because he did not give up he fail but he was successful in what he was doing. The reasons why am telling all this is that never tell your self that l will be failure on matter what you will be success. Other might say that it is bad ideas to be success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. However you can loss enthusiasm any time but if you never give up in what you are doing people do things that they dont believe in what they. One of my teacher in my school called Generic_Name gave as a test and the test was as difficult for as to do so he told him self how can the student do this work so try not to give the test to as the student in the classroom told him that we will can do the test so the teacher the told as that do you believer that you can do it and we said yes we can so he gave as the test to do. infant all the student that told that test pass successfully and the teacher was so happy. So you will be success without loss of enthusiasm. ln contusion, We have many things in the world that will make you a failure or success, make a discuss to yourself that you will success in life no matter how how things will go. My friends always told me that never give up in life, school and any thing you do. Maybe you have an exam today and when you went home yesterday you did not learn and you was watch TV and you want to pass the exam no matter what you will be failure in the exam. ls important to be success in life if you can be success you have to do what will make you success. l believe in my self that being a success is a good idea.",5,5,5,4,4,5,2649,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

And many ways I think it does, and in others I think it doesnt. It depend on the person, thats what I believe. It has a positive effects in the way that it can help people that feel along entertain thyself without nobody, I dont think that there are many things nothing worst then feel along. that can do bad things to people brains, and I am not saying that there is nothing worst, I mean be in prison, not had a job, die... and I had seen many people who prefer all those things before then be along, and checking out book, shopping, playing games, listening music in your favorite app, Pandora... or watching you favorite show in YouTube, Netflix or whatever other app that you use is positive way of use the technology. But you know in the worth nothing is perfect,like my grandfather used to say ""there has to be bad things, so that there could be good things"". every positive thing has to have it on negative thing. it has a negative effect on people lives because with the advice of the technology phone, and others the people are losing the interest in norma things, like some people dont even care about family reunion. I mean I never really care about that staff neither. I always preferred to be with my cousin, and my childhood friends then be in my house talking about boring things, but now you can not have simple conversation with some people because when you are talking to them most of the time they are in they phone doing who knows what, and I dont know about you. but to me thats a disreperfull way to tell me that you dont care about what im saying, and that could made people dislike you. technology is one of the greatest things ever invented, it made more easier the communication, it give entertainment to the people, it inform us of every that is happening in the worth, even in the space, and we dont have to read a whole book to find answer. technology has made every more easier, you can do almost anything, you can shopping without leave your house, order food... and all this stuff made people lazy, maybe they ask thyself why should I do this when my small phone or computer can do it for me, why should I date someone to talk to them when I can do it by my phone, why should I have to have a conversation with somebody when there is a whole lot of thing that I can do in my phone or competed.

631,631,602E786321EA,"Others may think otherwise, Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. Take Elon Musk for an example, he started out as a young kid who learned how to use computers but he did not stop there. Once he mastered computers he set higher and higher goals to master untill he ended up to be one of the richest man alive. I myself started with just drawing and graphic designing little art projects. then I started putting higher goals to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobes products and doing commisions. Leonardo DaVinci was not just an artist. He was an inventer. he invented numerous of things, he had multiple skills. thats because he mastered all of these skills he set higher goals for himself and he achived them. First examaple Elon musk. He was a bright kid. He leared how to use computers at a young age and mastered how to use them. Elon Musk did not stop there, He set higher goals to master. Elon Musk Drasticly Grew alot over the years. For and example he invented PayPal, SpaceX and Tesla. Now he is one of the riches man alive. Second example is myself. I started out with just Drawing and graphic Designing a simple banner for my YouTube channel. then I started setting higher goals for myself to master. Now I ended up learning how to use most of Adobes products. Doing commisions for YouTubers and Esports teams and making money. Last example is Leonardo DaVinci, Leoanrdo DaVinci was no ordinary artist from the Renissance Age. What made Leonardo DaVinci Stand out was that he was not a quitter infact he loved setting higher goals for himself to master. He loved growing, learning and mastering new things. Leoanrdo was not only an artist he was an inventor a scientist and that why he grew up to be one of many people biggest inspiration infact he is my inspiration. Leoanrdo was not a quiter and thats what made him grow up to be special and successful if life. Now other may say that you dont need set higher goals to grow. But I think quite the opposite becuase if you dont set higher goals for yourself then learning new things and growing new skills would most likely be impossible unless you try to surpass your last achivement therfore you wont be able to grow and be as successful in life.

636,636,5807D5F42CEB,"This is why employers should hire me. Employers should hire me because I can show hard work, really good hospitality, and good communication skills. These make a good employee. First reason why employers should hire me is because I show hard work. Hard work is essential because the harder you work the more you get done, and thats really helpful. For example, if youre playing soccer and you are trying to score a goal, you cant just score it magically while just standing there doing nothing. You have to work hard to score the goal by running, passing, and communicating with your team. All of that relates to hard work. Second reason why employers should hire me is because I show really great hospitality. This is really important because the more comfortable you can make the customer, the more they will enjoy the place and like it. For example if youre working at a hotel and a customer walks in, and right away you are not nice to them. They will start hating the place and they wont come back again. On the other hand if youre nice to them and make sure they enjoying their time. They will love the hotel and will always want to come back in the future. Last reason why employers should hire me is because I show really good communication skills. This is yet another really important characteristic to have as an employee. The reason being is because if you cant communicate well with a customer, they will have a really time figuring out what they need to do. For example, if you are working at a shop and a customer walks in and asks you for a specific thing. Then you start to get nervous because you dont know what to say or how to act, then they will have a hard time trying to find that specific thing because you didnt know how to communicate. These are the reasons of why employers should hire me. Employers should think of hiring me because I can show hard work, great hospitality, and good communication.

The present letter is to let you now that Im fascinating of your business management, and Ill be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at. In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future. To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like. Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldnt achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else. The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesnt have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for. I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things. Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.

Many studies have showed that social media is very helpful for those people that are insecure of themselves to interact whit others not just from their city but whit people from different places in the world. Technology is advancing, and it is trying to help people whit different needs. In this case technology allows people from everywhere to communicate whit others does not matter the place they are. It is a privilege for the people that are far away from their families. It is also a way that people use to get away from having uncomfortable chats whit people from their surroundings. However the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has many negative effects. Because people miss the opportunity of having nice moments whit their family, their families start to break apart. Thats the case of my cousins family. they were a beautiful family but everything went apart because my cousins wife spent most of her time on Facebook, where she found a random guy, so she left my cousin whit their three daughters and one son. social media can destroy families and relationships in seconds, but is our duty to enjoy our time whit the people that we love because we show the love that we feel for them and communication by technology can never do that. We do not know if one day the people we love are going to leave, but if they leave we are going to keep those priceless memories on our heart. Family is everything and we should never let anything get us apart from it. Even if social media allows people from everywhere interact whit each other; there is a high risk of met whit someone dangerous. There are many cases where young ladies have being abducted. This happen when young ladies decide to met boys from social media that result not being what they thought but kidnappers. Those kidnappers sale the young ladies, and this poor girls are forced to give up on themselves and work as prostitutes. All of this could be avoided if we start to know better about the people near us instead of trying to met someone that we dont know anything about . Its important to recognize that social media have benefits if we know how to use it correctly, but we need to be careful because we have to know other people better before trusting them, and it is even better if we already have had a chat in person whit those people. In conclusion the world is constantly changing and technology is an important factor in actuality, but in those cases where technology is used incorrectly many people can get damaged. Technology is not a need but is a benefit, and if we are allowed to use it, we should do it whit responsibility and not depend from it. In spit of the fact some people believe that technology is more than necessary, and that there is no need of human interaction because it helps people with communication problems, in truth the limitation of human contact due the use of technology has just negative effects because we can experience more than one danger; like losing our family or being forced to a prostitute. Communication in person is necessary, there is no better way of live our life than enjoying the time whit our family, the little chats and of curs taking the opportunity of get to know better each one near us. A computer or a phone can never transmit our feelings, and if people want to express themselves they do not have to be trapped on technology.

645,645,35A1342EF397,"Is it good for a high school student to graduate in three years instead of the four year traditional? Lets call it the high school shortcut. Some school districts offer this opportunitie to high school students in order to make them graduate one year earlier. Based on my personal perspective, an early high school graduation is a very good experience for high school students. The high school shortcut makes student motivated to think about building their future quickly, increases the degree of their maturity and also help those students to proceed in life easily and faster. High schools should make sure that students are motivated to think about their future and help them by making sure theyre in the right path. Some students dont try to enter college right after graduating, some of them will take a year off and some of them dont try to enter college at all. By motivating to think about their future a mean that they would propably be more motivated to enter college at a young age than a certain type of age. Going to college and start chasing your dream at a young age will make students more mature. Life after high school is something serious weither you go to college or enter the military starting it at a young age would make students more ecxited and make them became mature at a young age. So with the high school shortcut students will have the ability of gainning a lot knowledge about the branche they want to study young and quicker. As soon as the high school students gain the knowledge that high school provides, proceeding easily and faster with the high school shortcut is and good opportunitie that should be chosen. Some of those high school students think that its a waist of time taking a four years high school knowing that a three year high school that provides the same type of knowledge is a possible choice for them. As far as Im concerned, I strongly believe that the high school shortcut which is graduating i three years instead of four years is a great opportunitie. Either students who wants to graduate early or even students who wants to take their time in high school should take advantage of this opportunitie.",8,8,9,6,7,7,697,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Yes, there maybe others who will be in your life time their to persuade you to do bad things but its up to you if you want to stay with those kinds of people. First of all your character is something that make you,you and thats whether you choose to be good or bad, nice or mean. Their are many different types of people in the world and they have their own characters. Secondly all people are different and special in many ways like people could help others, they could donate their time to help the elderly, they could spend time with loved ones, or they could do bad things like stealing and other stuff like that but that all comes from you, you decide to do all those thing whether good or bad that your traits as a human being.

649,649,D8F9861CD318,"It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years, and enter college or the work early ? The programs that some school districts offer to the students that allow students to graduate one year early, is not covenient for the students. To do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself. They will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student. It is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school. First, to do only three years of high school is not a good way to start forming yourself for the future, all this is based on the future and what you are going be able to do, for example, if you do not do the four years in high school you will miss more information, that is going to affect you in the future, and sometimes you will not be able to select courses, or in some cases you will have to take these courses on summer, which is not a good idea, because most of the students with ages around sixteen and eighteen hang out a lot, so for the students is harder to focus on their thing as their courses, While the students that are doing four years of high school will have more time to focus on their courser, and they will have the oportunity to learn more. Second, the student that decided to graduated early are not goint to have the necessary knowlege, as the students that are doing the four years, for example, responsibility is one of the most important things, that you will use in the future, so how can you get it, for example, the homework, projects, and team work that you will have in high school, because doing four years in high school give you responsibility, and new abilities in the proces of learnig, also it develop your brain, and as consequences of learnig, and responsibility you will get new skills that you will be able to use in your work area, or college, while the students that graduated early are not going to be able not have the enough experience to enter a new system. Last, in my opinion the school that let student graduated one year early are not thinking in the welfare of the students, because they are not just letting the students go ealry, the schools had found a way that the student can rush themself to get out of the school soon, to go to college or work instead of doing the four years in high school, that will help a lot in the future. Because it is not a good way to enter college nor work without finish the four years of high school, the students will not have the necessary knowlege as a regular high school student; to do only three years of high school is not good way to start forming yourself for the future.

I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who Im today?

651,651,863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldnt be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they dont let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law. Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. Thats why parents would feel like its a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids dont even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldnt feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didnt have parents. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and theyll have to face their actions. If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think its not important to learn like if it isnt important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults. Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they dont. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldnt be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they dont listen after theyve been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful. In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",7,7,8,8,9,8,1775,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Well everyone has their own different type of way to accomplish something, but there is always some kind of inactivity at times; but not always. I think that we really do accomplish more when there is something else happening. Everyone in this world is different compared to the next person. Everyone has their own unique style of completing an assignment. Some examples are Listening to music , working outside, working with someone else, and basically anywhere else. These small things can help somebody to Stay in task to complete something. Myself personally I love to be listening to music to get my assignments done. I am able to accomplish more than what I usually do. Before i never got my school work completed cause i was really bored of doing it, but when I first played music. I was flowing threw to get my work done. Sometimes when trying to accomplish anything in life. Some people may experience some inactivity.

Me for myself i love using my phone. I never get bored of it. Sometimes while im working to get my assignments done and complete. There will always be a notification that will make my phone go ""Buzz buzz"" and then ill have the courage to see what it is. Now I have overcome that. What i do now is i put my phone on silent away from me while its connected to my Bluetooth speaker playing music. This always helps me from zoning out. Music playing in the background prevents me from zoning out. some people can complete everything without a doubt, But not everyone could stay on task to complete something to accomplish it. We all had accomplish something in this world; but some people havent accomplish anything at all. Their minds are not set for reality I must say. Their minds are inactive and not set for anything. People can change. Anything can happen. Nothing in this world is really impossible, well if you set your mind to it. People dont believe in themselves to Accomplish anything. The inactivity that they got can change. Before i used to never get anything completed/Accomplish. I was thought I wasnt enough to do anything. I always made bad choices. My mind wasnt set for anything. I didnt care. I thought my life was a joke and soon it will be over as soon as I know it. School was hard. I didnt really get anything done. I was never the perfect student. My grades were bad. I had no faith in myself. I thought i could not do anything right. I never accomplished anything. The only thing I could accomplish is messing up everything. School, at home, In a public area, Anywhere. I made bad choices back in my pass; But now its completed different.

Its still better off to accomplish it even tho there is always gonna be a little bit of inactivity, and its okay there are always a way to over come it. Everyone can always change.

Also i have a example that im live in my life each day that is when a people as me,when i going to live a other country very different to mine with his way to live and it more important his language is very hard no can to communicate with them, but the beginning is very hard for any people change of country and is more hard if no know the language, but i dont give up because i know it that im very smart and with more effort, faith, and help of my teachers, mom and family little to little better my english and each day i learn of new things in the life because never leave of learn in the life. i disagree not can understand it and not can say nothing. For this failure plays a role very important in ours life because show as the people has abilities for can do any things and know that all the people has intelligence for can achieve it. The failures in the life to help to better and think about that can help to better and however, i think that each people has a goal in the life and not should to renounce a ours dreams, goals that should of achieve it. Because in the life each people to choose his destiny in the life but i think that all people has a fault but each people has of power for eliminate it of his life. In conclusion, all the people should of has any failure for can better and achieve his success and happiness in the life with love, hope, and effort for that nothing in the life is so easy , everybody needs is very focus in the life because until the own family may be can think that you are a dump but can show you that you are ""the best"" and that nobody can stop your success in the life and nobody can to take your dreams and goals of your mind and heart and always each day should of think this is my best day, and wake up with spirits of better and be a great pride for your wife, son and people that believe in you , and with help of this people so important in you life give you spirits for achieve it and they to go with your steps to sucess in the life .",6,5,6,6,4,6,1261,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I put in all my time and effort and dedication into it , my project ended up getting the highest grade than most of the other groups. ive been told i am a risk taker ,I do things others would consider to be rational or crazy. On a different project I worked on I chose to do the most challenging one , no one would take it because there was a lot of writing needed to be put in and a lot of researching and information needed to be discovered . I am not afraid of challenges I like them I like expanding my knowledge and going above and beyond ,showing others my potential . I am open minded when it comes to others and my ability to work well with others and communicate with them will blow your mind i am not afraid to talk in a crowd or present and i take joy in working with others and helping them out .

Most teenagers cant participate in any extracurricular activity for different reasons. For example, in Generic_Name experience was because she had to look after her brothers. Occasionally teenagers look for ways to spend time doing what they like. In fact, there have been many cases where teenagers use a sport to feel less stress or to spend more time with their friends, for these reason teenagers should be able to participate in extracurricular activities. Recently researches discovered that kids that are more active in their life-style can concentrate more than kids that stay in their houses doing nothing all day, like when Generic_Name was practicing the sport she start making new friends and loving the progress she was making every day. Generic_Name parents felt surprise because their daughter was following her dream. Some parents think sports are a waste of time and that you are not going to needed in the future, although its going to help you in the future in many ways . For example, before Generic_Name was in the team of runners she felt tired all the time, but went she start practicing she was more active . Most teenagers dont like sports, as a result of that the principal add more things you can do. Know you can decide what do you want to do after school.

First, There will be many mistake while making a decision. But we need to keep thinking of it and find a way. Example, Edison, who made a light bulb, do you think did he make it without mistake? No, there are a lot of failed experiments and mistakes. But he didnt stop to make it. He did keep practicing and, figure out other way to success making the light bulb. Second, in our society, there are a lot of people who accomplish more than other. Almost of them always did something like practice their experiment, find a way to figure out it, think about their purpose and each way to make it correct. Also they wanted to solve question of their problems. People cant be inactivity to do these. Doing a lot of work, and never to be idle, can accomplish more.

Almost of them, there is no one who accomplish more, with out any effort. Idle people do not focus on their project then, how can they make the result better?

You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next. The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions.

Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because its showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes.",6,7,6,6,5,7,2301,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

670,670,ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. Its like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family. First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important. Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). Ive seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing. Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However youre just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world youll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad. In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has its flaws it also has its pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything.

Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early. First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better. Second, some students dont want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school, Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer. In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they cant think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life.

673,673,036042533396,"Do you ever feel like giving up just because you failed and you feel like nothing is going your way ? In this paper i will argue that success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasms Sometimes its okay to feel upset,mad and frustrated when you think youre trying your best and it seem like. Nothing its working out for you . Failure is the way to success and some people seem not okay with it. Most people also dont understand why it has to be like this. However we dont always get what we want in life and thats a fact. Because thats just the way it is you cant blame yourself for it either. Most of us think that you have to be successful the first time you try something. But sadly thats not how works for some of us but some are just lucky. I remember a few years back when my Aunt Generic_Name open her second beauty salon. She was quite upset because nothing was going the way she wanted to and how she planned. It wasnt going well she felt like everything was falling apart. She started to lose a lot of costumers the first year she open the salon. But 2 years later she started to promote her beauty salon again. She kept trying till she achieved her goals and now everything going well for her. I think one the things that helped her a lot was her positive attitude towards everything. She also didnt lose her enthusiasm. I think this is a good example of success consist of failure Some of us might not agree that Success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I know a few people that dont have this mentality. Just because you werent successful doesnt mean youre not going to be somebody. Or that you need to stop trying because its not meant for you. But they are wrong because at the end of the day what matters is what you think youre capable of doing and what you can do. Dont let others people get to you and keep hoping for the better. Another good example is most of the big celebrities that we know now days like Oprah,Ellen DeGeneres and many more were turn down before had disappointments and maybe gave up for a moment . But they never lost their enthusiasms and they made their dreams come true and pretty much thats how you become successful in life. From time to time you need to start taking those Failures as a lesson and just keep trying to do better. Because thats how life is. Because you attempt to do something and it didnt go your way doesnt mean you have to put it aside. We are humans we make mistakes. But you just cant give up easily and losing hope. Its not an option either you just have to keep pushing and like people say Fake it till you make it . In the future i hope people start realizing that opportunities come and go. Theres nothing wrong with failure. Im pretty sure we all been there before and its okay to feel like crap. But its not okay to stop trying just because one door closes many more can open for you. You can go as far as you want to because youre the only one that can stop you from being successful. ",7,7,7,8,6,8,34,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

675,675,D7817C171926,"Benefits of long summer break Most students enjoy summer vacation and like to have a fun time. Some students may have more time to share with their family. However some students uses that time to have a job and earn money for any emergency or for keep saving for their scholarships, if they have planned go to the college. I believed that students should have a regular summer break because some students have the ability to remember everything they learned before summer break, and also students may enjoy the weather and have some fun time. First reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to develop their strength, while they are enjoying their summer break. For instance some students may have summer school where they could make some extra schools work and keep everything they learned in mind. for instance my family just have time in summer, so I would like to try to do some extra help in summer school, and then enjoy the rest of the summer time with friends and family. also there are a few reason that why students may have a regular summer break. Continuosly I will explain some more reason. Second reason that students should have a regular summer break is that students may be able to enjoy their break going to the pool, to camp, the river, the beach etc. however students may have also time to study on any subject that they want and have a fun time. Students may have a time for themself, for instance they may sleep and wake up at any time they want, hence they have to clean up their house and give to their family some help. Also students may study at home with their sibling in case they have, and do some activities to remember everything they learned. Third reason is that some educators feel that the summer break is too long and because that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. but if educators really knows their students, they may be agree with the regular summer break because that the only time that with have with a good weather to enjoy outside of the house. what about if students have a long winter break, they will not be able to go outside because the snow or for the lowest temperature. what about if students have spring and fall off, also that time of the year is still cold not a lot of snow but cold, students may get sickness or something else. In addition if students need to work because, they do not have the resort or the benefits as another students, they have to work but in winter time in some place of job are not hiring so the could not work in winter break. In the final analysis some people would argue that students should have three-four week break in summer, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. however, the summer break is the best time of the year, because students may do something else as play any sports they want, and enjoy that time. Students may have the ability to retain information even after summer break. addionality students would like the advance that they have of having a long summer break and be prepared for the next schools year.

676,676,2265CC4410DE,"Changing the lunches to healthier lunches will effect more then just the cafeterias. It will change how people eat, and changing the food habits which is not good. Some adults and parents might love the change, but as teens it might have to be a nightmare. People having favorite lunches and enjoying what they buy to eat should be the goal. Not having to be inforced to eat healthy food on a daily. The school board should speak, and see all the possible outcomes of this change before making a desicion. Think of how many kids wont eat anymore, because of this change. Losing some of their favorite foods would change everything. Not only a loss for the kids, but a loss for the school as well. Losing more money as more kids stop buying lunch. This could not only effect the stomachs of the people not eating, but could also effect their learning and how they do in school. Nutrition is a big thing in school, because you need it in your system to function. Habits are also being changed. Being enforced to bring food from the outside. Some people would probably even leave school. That should be one of the schools biggest fears. They are legally in charge of you at schoool, and if you decide to leave, and something happens to you; that can not be good for the school. There are so many things that could fall into this. People coming in and out of the school with food for others. Random people could indentify as a student due to holding a backpack and having food in their hands, so a student opens a door for them. Some parents are obviously going to disagree. They want their kid or kids to eat, and do well in school. The amount of complaining will be very untolerable and annoying. There should just be a balance between healthy and unhealthy. For example one line could be serving healthy food, and the other could be serving what they used to be serving. They should be making it work instead of making them unhappy. I really think everything should be looked over again. Making big time decisions like this could really effect the school. I think many people should have a say in this including high representative students, and very exclusive clubs. Some being National Honor Society, Key Club, and maybe even the the county board itself. Thank you so much for hearing me out, and hopefully you take my ideas into perspective.

I think the principal should think about other extracurricular activities. Like other schools dont have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said theirs art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some dont some students dont like making year books some students dont like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want. There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students dont only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things.

Also working with a group makes it faster to finish the tasks; some people take longer than others so its good to have people around to help. Most people believe that working alone is better but working in a group is more beneficial for example,if there is a problem that needs to be solved it is easier to solve it because there are more people to figure out the problem and to give their opinions; which will help throughout the way. In other words, if one of the group members has trouble with the assignment another group member could help them out;instead of figuring it out by themselves. Working in groups could also make assignments become complete faster for example,some students while working alone take a long time and end up having to take their assignments home for homework; while in a group they can come up with a solution together and get it complete. It will also benefit the teacher because there wont be any late papers. There are benefits of working in a group but there are also benefits of working by yourself for example,sometimes it gets loud in the group and it will be hard for them to focus and get their work done also some students like to mess around and play fight instead of getting there work done. Even tho working in groups could cause a lot of talking and play fighting , it is still a more beneficial way for students.

Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasnt good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them. My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots; when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft. Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasnt good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build.

I use thought that wasnt at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. This show that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. She always practical how to read in English and write English. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned. Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish. Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience.

To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it. Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didnt continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didnt find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal. We cant improve our skills until we dont try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we dont we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. Its all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday. In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.

Students at grade nine through twelve get to learn what they want to be at a young age. It gets them more interested in the careers they choose in the nearest future. As they get through high school, they will know what path to take and what needs to get done. As soon as these young adults leave they wont have to stress of what their going to be. Its agreeable for students to start looking into their career at a young age. Through out the years in High school, students will have the rights to choose their own courses, which follows up to their interest. For example: culinary arts, design multi media, masonry, and more. They can also choose any subjects such as: math, English, science, and history. These courses can also help those students with their future careers. While these students are learning they realize what they like and what they dont like. The upcoming goal for them by the time they leave high school is what they are going to become. As these young adults think of what their going to be, they will think twice on some careers. Which gives them time to research options, and that research will reflect on which career is the best for them. While being young an thinking of a career students will have enough time to sort the ones the students like and the ones they dislike. The average life Span of a human is up to 75 years, which means 18 of those years can resolve of what the students are going to do when they grow up. Teens can dream what they could be but can they put the effort in trying. As in college, students will have to get credits to graduate high school, and need to pass a amount of exams. From there the students path will flow to what college theyll go, when thinking young they got to think smart, which means they got to put the effort. When thinking of a career at a young age the students will have most of everything planned. Its never too much to notice that a student has more potential young than old because they got more time. The students wont stress out because their not out in the world alone finding what to do. Teens can commit to any career because they have had a whole lot of time to think of any career.

If we are always working hard, we can achieved what we want and even more, I think thats what Jefferson wanted to said with his words, the more you learn and do over your life, the more you will get, people will need you, and because they will need you, they would do whatever they can to get you. Let me put you an example, think about your job, imagine you work in a restaurant, and you start as a cashier, and then you start to learn more, like you start to work in preparation, and then you put your hands in the kitchen, over time, you learn the system of the restaurant, how it work and everything; next thing you know you are the manager, but then you get tired and you quit your job, so then you can open your own place, and thanks to all you did in the restaurant now you have the experience to run your own place, and even better. Everything you get in your life will be thanks to all you try and learn, because even though sometimes things get difficult, it will always have a reward at the end. This is like when we were kids, and our parents made us do things that we didnt like, for example, when I was a kid I hated to do my reading and writing homework, because I didnt know to do it, but now that I think about it, thanks to all the homework I did, now I know how to read and write in Spanish and English, because even though I didnt want to do my homework, my parents push me to do it, to learn and to be better every day. When I was a kid, my grandma always told me to said ""excuse me and thank you,"" at some point I did it because my grandma told me to do it, but now I see that my grandma though me something a lot of people forgot to do. Everything we learn make us better everyday. Some people may believed inactivity is also something good; sometimes doing nothing, is doing more, and is okay to just stop everything and take a break once in a while, but just wait to see if things work by their own is not the best, if you want things to work in your life you have to work hard and never stop, because if you dont work for what you want nobody else will do it for you. ""It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" Thomas Jefferson was right it is wonderful to see what we can do if we never stop. We are humans and we are smart, not perfect; we can do so much amazing things if we just try and work hard, all we have to do is dont give up.",7,6,8,8,6,6,3556,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Some parents will not agree I think because they will be working and they dont know with who they can leave their kids with. Video Conferencing could work for students instead of online classes because that way the person that will come to teach you can explain more better from the assignments that your suppose to do. Some students just prefer someone to teach them for they can help with what they are doing. Students will benefit from being abkle to attend classes from home will some students they would rather take classes home then school because in school they think its more harder for them for the reason of being with alot of stusdents. They like to work alone quite and with someone who can have patients and work slowly and have time.

Although some schools offer distances learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. I disagree to students take the classes on home because they not learn the same as in the school, if students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking, and Students did not have the same opcion like others students. The students who take classes from home, not learn the same in the school and this can be are difficult for them. For example, most of students lose the test because they forget the impormation that they learn in online classes and the time of the test they not remember enyting. Sincerity, take classes from home it is difficult for students the short learning because they not have the same capacity like others students. The students can be improve in the school more that from home, because from home they teaching they self. In addition, most of school believe that give classes from home can be helf students, but this is a big error. If the students have a question, or doubt did not have a teacher to asking since, they answer themself. For example, sometimes the students do not know how to make homework, project, etc and they need someone to helf them. Also, every students need a teacher to explain everything that they need to make, and if they make the classes from home is impossible to make the thing good if did not have a teacher. It not the same to make the calsses online or in school because in online it is person who teaching for only a short moment, nevertheless in the school the teacher teaching for like 8 hours and helf in sonthing that students need. In effect, some students do not have capacity to make the classes from home, they needing to make the classes in the school to learn more. Students did not have the same opcion like others students like the time or the learning. For example, most of them have a job and they not have the time to take the classes from home, because they lose the time in the job and when they going to the home they are tired and only going to sleep. While, the others students improve their life in the schools the others students who make the classes onlone not learn enything because they not have time. Make the classes from home it is not necesary for students because they can going to school every day and work after school and with this method they have more chance to improve they learning. Truly, The school give the option but the students have the choice. In conclutiong, they not learn in the classes from home that in the school, and this can be affect tehir learning. They teaching themself because in home tehy do not have a teacher to helf them. THey not have same opportinity like others students because they can be not have time to make the all thing. Some school have this option but it is not a good idea for students because they not focus in online classes and they fail.

People will going to try to change your personality but you going to see what is right for you. People cant not change your personality because is your own thought. Some people knows their own personality if they want to be a good characher or bad. Some people can give bad advice or some people want to trap you.

People need to understand or think before what character they want because everyone is different their thought or feelings. Some people need to choose what character is right for themself. while some people believe that we choose our characher traits, some people believe that our character formed by influeces beyond our control because they think that influences change their though or actions.

691,691,99A3641592CA,"Do you think immagination is more important than knowledge? Why do you think its important? Lets see why I think its important! Well think about this you have the knowledge, but you never immagine things that you think you cant do. If you just immagine or think bigger about what you want or what you want to do. One day you will achive your goal or dream. One of the reason why I think immagination is importantant is that if you dont immagine what you want to do in future as your job or hobby. When your in school your not going to try your best and show effort. If you dont learn anything at school when you are older to get a job, your not going to get the job you want, because wherever you are there will be someone that want the same job as you but trying harder than you, learning harder than you, and showing more effort than you. Which means effort creates achivements. For example, you went to an interview for a job at a store to be a cashier and there are 15 people that want to be cashier. But they only need one. So first they asked everyone what do you do when the costumer comes in. One of them said you have to smile and say hey, do you need help with anything? and you said you continue doing whatever your doing. Who do you think there going to pick? Of course the first one right? because she showed them effort and willing to do the job. That why you have to immagine what you want to do in future and try your best in school. Second reason is that you have your knowledge, but if you dont immagine or think bigger your not going achive big things in your life. The people who failure in life are the people who quit something one step away from success. Thats what a lot of people do. But the people who successed in life are the people who took the step that a lot people quit which the hardest step to take. For example, you want to start a company, but the people around you said that your not going to success. Although they said that you started a company anyways. After a month no one wanted to invest you company. You kept asking people to invest your company. So one person did, with that money you payed the bill. Then nothing happened to your company. But if you stop asking people when no one wanted to invest your company your company would of been closed. So you have to immagine thing and use your knowledge to achive them. Third reason is you have to immagine things as your dream and get a lot of knowledge by learning at school. When I was little I wanted to become a docter when I grow up. Then I started immagining to help and more stuff. When I go to school. I told myself you have to be good at science, math and other subject to become a docter. So I will have knowledge about things that you have to know to become docter. so you have to get a lot of knowledge to achive the things you immagine. So I think immagination is more important than knowledge. But knowledge is still really important. I feel like everything starts with immagination first. Then you go to school to get your knowledge increase every year. You work really hard to make immagination becomes reality.

692,692,52DC3B7C3952,"Working From Home Should students be allowed to attend classes from home? I agree that attending classes while at home would be beneficial for many people and can actually help them work better. One reason is that it would be less stressful for the student and put a lot less pressure into getting the work done. Another reason is that it would give them more time to work, for example they could relax and take little breaks while working instead of having to cram all that work into one class session. My last reason is that it would help improve grades. If a student is allowed to work while being at home, it would allow their brain time to think more about their work and how they can improve it. Attending classes from home would be less stressful and put a lot less pressure on the student. For example, one class session is an hour and thirty minutes. Teachers give a lot of work to students and expect them to get it done without any problem, but the problem is they cant because being forced to do a lot of work is not very fun and with very limited time can put a lot of stress on the teenage brain and also damage their mental health. Expectations now a days are really high for students but their mental health and state arent taken into consideration. Time is of the essence. Students need time to get their work done and whatever they arent able to complete becomes homework. Having to do a lot of work without being able to take a break can really suck. Imagine if you had to do a bunch of work without being able to take a rest because whatever you dont complete youre gonna have to complete at home. If students could work from home, theyd have all the time they need to get their work done and they could take a break if they got too tired. At home students wouldnt have to worry about time because they could complete the work at their own pace. Grades are important, and when a student gets a bad grade, it isnt exactly the best look. Working from home would allow students more time to think about their work, when in a classroom students cant spend a lot of time thinking because they dont have much time. On the other hand, being at home would give them all the time they could possibly need to complete their work and how they could improve it for a better grade. If students could improve their work they would get better grades, and theres no better place to do that then home, the place youre most comfortable with. To sum it all up, students should be allowed to attend classes from home because it causes less stress and pressure which is better for their mental health, gives them more time to think and do their work, and helps improve their grades while in a place theyre more comfortable with.",10,10,9,10,10,10,1083,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 10, vocabulary 9, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

694,694,FBC421A7BE79,"Generaly saying,people do accomplish more if we are always doing something. in live if you dont want to do anything you will become blind to the society and be left undone because you have waste the day and time not doing accomplishing things with your live but focus on things that are not accomplishing your live. for example: playing video, twitter, face time, and snapshot. all these thing are waste your time all depends on the way it being use. and if you fall in that position of not accomplishing when you get older its going to effect you. example: you will start rubbing,mudring because you didnt put your mind on accomplishing anything. it is also important to accomplish more. my reason for saying this is the more you do accomplishment the more you go farward in anything. for example; by making good grade in school, by being a good leader, and also helping people if they do needs help all these things you are accomplishing something. everybody do want to accomplish something in life but you have to work for it. To be sucessful you have to accomplish everything in life. any people in this world today, have gotten good position for their accomplishment. i know, some time its hard to do but like i said if you want to accomplish something in life you have to work for it. for example: like the brids we see today they have to go through a lot of stages. bruds cannot just be born and start to fly the same day they have to go through before they fly. so they accomplish their flyinh by process and it is the same as human we go through processes to accomplish things we want. our lives go by days and hours the day we see today will never return so why not accomplish somehting within that day because when that day is gone you have waste thime,and abilities to accomplish something. lets be honest the world today need someone that never give up. it is amazing for some one to reward you for your accompishment. today many of us went to be a doctor,lawyer, and so on but, we are not putting the effort and time. one way to accomplish thing in live is this pay attention to things, learn from mistake using your time and effort if you found yourself doing this you are going to accomplish many thing. the reason why many poeple dont accomplish things is this they dont pay attention not willing to ascept their wrong doing and don,t use their time and effort. for example; i want to be a doctor i have to pay attention in biology class, read books, and also make good grade iam accomplishing what are want to do because are do it constanly and i love it to so that give me more intrest in doing it. therefore, to make the world a better place we have to do better talking by mouth and not putting to action it don,t work so if you ready want to accomplish some thing in live you have to always do it never give up and always found your self doing something not playing arround be a better you for your tomorrow. santly ",6,6,6,7,5,5,3812,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
695,695,8B4A210026AD,"Well I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is with your family and friends making some hamburgers, hot dogs, carne asada, tacos, and barbacoa.

Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people dont have family and friends and there are all alone thats why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and than eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the you are having fun fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while their are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk yo relax your brain and refletionate and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because thats where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.

696,696,FE459F8CF4CE,"""A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", this phrase said by the American jazz legend Duke Ellington means that if you have a problem you can use it to improve yourself and I agree with this statement because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. Problems make your brain to grow up, imagine being on a math test and you dont know the answer, probably you will be scared but if you try hard to remember what is the answer you will find it, usually problems are too hard to solve and this fact helps you to make your brain to think a way to solve the problems, this can cause your brain to grow up by using all your energy to think in what you can do in this situation. Problems gives you knowledge, there should be a reason for you to be in a problem, if you fight in the school or anywhere with another person or you do something bad, probably someone will call you to the office or take you to the police department , if you are in a problem the first thing you will do is think on why this happened and this helps you because you will know what you did bad and will not do it again. Problems makes your personality stronger, if you crash your car you may feel bad and scared for this event, I had a test that it was hard and in that moment I felt bad, so most of the time when you have a problem you will feel stressed, this stress can be bad for your brain but it can also help you to be more patient and determined in your goal that is solving your problem, with this two things your personality will be stronger that before the problem. In conclusion, I think that Duke Ellington is right because problems can help you by making your brain grow up, giving you knowledge, and making your personality stronger. So if you are in a problem you should take the lead of this situation and be determined in solving it, is not the end of the world only because you have a problem, and now you know that problems can help you.",6,4,8,6,6,6,3863,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

The food in Korea is so tasty for example the korean BBQ (Barbeque). Korean BBQS is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse its spicy and I love spicy foods.

The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan. Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. Every single thing in the hotel in is clean beacuse korean people dont like to be messy they love to be organized. The relaxition spas are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress.

699,699,8EF3D97E2310,"The term success has a different meaning for everyone, but still it is what everyone wants. No matter what the goal is, in order to approach that goal, and to be successful you need hard work. I believe the majority will agree with this statement, but everyone does not agree, and talk about positive attitude. People miss the importance of positive attitude which is the key for success. Chances in life comes and goes that some might not even see. All of the hard work has no meaning if there is no pay back for this hard work. Loosing the sight while working hard causes to miss the train, but having positive attitude makes individuals seek for opportunities. If the goal is success, then missing the chance to making it come true must be avoided. When individuals miss the first chance they think there is no more chance and they loose the rest of there positivity. Even in our daily life, when we start of our they in a negative way; the rest of the day follows that bad influence, and makes us miss the good parts of the day. Having a negative environment affects the individuals the worst way possible, especially if the individual does not have a positive attitude to fight back. Fighting back with a positive attitude is also going to influence others to have a better view, so it does not just affect the individuals success, but others too. When we take a look at the most famous entrepreneurs we see how a great environment they have, and how successful the people around them is, like they are. It is the positive attitude that spreads the influence and makes a better habitat. The positive influence follows it self and creates a better habitat, and a better habitat will cause success. Reaching to the best of the goal is impossible with out hard work. There has to be a effort to find the right way, but having the negativity is going to close the door for opportunities. However, setting up a positive mind set is the part what individuals misses. Positive attitude is what is going to bring the opportunities, and make the individuals create their own chances. Famous entrepreneurs like Elon Musk would not be the Elon Musk that we know today if he did not had the positive attitude. Elon Musk created a company named ""SpaceX"" for Space craft, and if he gave up on the first failure, and did not had the positive attitude, he would have never reached to his goal, and be successful. He created his own chance to success with positive attitude. In conclusion, positive attitude has a big influence on success. Every individual can have a different explanation for their goal, and the goal is the positive influence in their life.

Keep follow what you are interesting and try to do it. If you want to know more than a languages or want to try to do something not your domain and you have no skill in that things, you should try to learn what youre interest, and try to talk to a person who is speak a language you are interesting, and asking a person who have known about the domain you are interesting, and try to do your best in that thing.

702,702,655BD307F87D,"Many students in high school are looking for the way to reduce their time in school, there are several reason for students to think about it. These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason. In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school. In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation. Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money. The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general. The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",8,7,9,9,7,8,1323,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
703,703,0230A077F5B6,"some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years insted of the tradional four years. I believe that high school student should not allow to graduate in three years. Beacuse for example they are not going to have free time with friends, its hard for student who learnd new language and some student work afther school. Did you imagen yours child spend all day at school studying hard out seem their parents most of the day just want tham graduate in less then four years. To begin with, all single child or student need to have free time play with the friends the student dont have to worry about stay afther school to study. most student like afther school go to thier friends houses to play video game, go to eat restaurent also student who graduate in four years dont have to be take any clases during summer or evenings. they can have time to play any sport they like during summer insted of be in at school taking any clases. In addition for those student who are learning a new language three years is not enought time to learnd every single studnet differnt time to learn some of than learn faster than others student this program that offer that allow high school student graduate in three years,may have to know that each student laern differenly. Anothers disavanges to graduate in three years insted of four is that student dont have time to secand chances to take any felling sol or test they must have to pass each test or sol each years to able to graduate. I feel that is too much prechers for student who learning a new language that they dont have enought time to learn better, that can effect the student when they want to attend to go to callage. Its song that one years cant make any different but,for must of student will be make different,in one years we can prepere student whow callage are what is the different bitween high school classes and callage classes. The least but list as we know some student work afther school the issue is that this student dont have time to do their homework and study for any test some tham student work fourty hours per week they are going to sleep late night its hard to attend to school everyday and work at the same time. they just not focus in school they have anothers responsability for example, help their family pay bill or rent so,this student may take the four years to graduate from high school they can do some make up some work and study. Inconclusion In my opinon the student from high school should not allow to graduate in three years we can keep traditional four years. in this case the student can have more time to play with the friends, time to learn better a new language learn more in high school to be ready for callage and they can have time to help their family with anything this programs should help the student to keep traditional four years the student are future any country may have suppor with are better for them.

People get home from work to go watch T.V. or be on their phone all night long. People dont have family dinner anymore. This is a big problems that has effected a lot of people. When I was younger I remember my parents giving me a lot of attention. As I started growing up it started to go away. We wouldnt go on trips anymore. We all wouldnt be at the dinner table anymore.

706,706,66FF0907BF26,"Do you ever wonder if most students use their phones in school for educational purposes? In my opinion cell phone use in a classroom is not a bad thing depending weather they take advantage on getting work done or goof around the majority of the students in school take advantage of their phones about Seventy Five percent of students like to use their phones for social media and music. When teachers are in classes during instructional time about half the class is paying attention, the other half of the class is on their phones texting friends or updating social media and then dont know what the lesson is about when they get called on to answer questions on the board. Phones are usually a distraction to teachers and also to the person using the phone. Phones can also be a positive thing when doing paper work or projects when listening to music it can help concentrate more without getting distracted from others peers. When listening to music when youre working it gives off a positive affect on your brain, it gets your mind going with different types of ideas and keeps you from falling asleep. Cell phones bring hundreds of resources that would be able to help you get answers or help you understand certain questions , meaning of words , and how to pronounce different type of sentences from other languages. Most teachers dont allow phones or headphones in a classroom because they assume everyones going to start texting and be on social media, cell phones are important to have close just in case of an emergency at home. In case if you wanna check up on your siblings, mom, or dad even if you can notify the school about contacting your parents or your parents contacting the school itll be easier for them to call you. Some schools usually provide tablets for students to use so they wouldnt have to worry about loosing an assignment or turning it in late, but the majority of the time you need internet to be able to open up assignmets to turn in school students usually have tablet problems and turn it in so it could get fixed. Cell phones is a big help it can usually download applications that you neeed to do work without being behind in certain subjects so there shouldnt be an excuses on why assignments are late, or missing and thats why cell phones are a positive affect for educational purposes as long as teachers are consistant on supervising students cell phone use.",6,6,7,7,8,6,1340,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

712,712,597D76A3BF40,"I would like to start of this topic with a important question that no human being really thinks about, ""How is technology impacting our health?"" That is one of the most important questions that we cant leave unanswered. The use of technology have rooted in our lives, from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to bed we have hundreds of interaction with various devices, software programs, and tools. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having any contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to any other person. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. While one might think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on peoples lives, others might think that the lack of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives which most people agree with. When comparing two human beings, one human being that always uses technology to do everything, shop, check out books, play games, do homework, and even talk to friends or family members, that person is most likely going to get sick, be in a lot of pain, or even feel depressed sooner then the person that prefers not to use technology at all but instead of using technology they would rather go out to the store to buy a book, go out to the store to shop new clothes, and even instead of calling on the phone to check on a family member they would rather go out and see them in real life. The reason the person that uses technology more is more likely to get sick or be in pain sooner than the other one is because not only computers and devices encourage more sedentary behavior among users but they also frequently lead to poor posture, neck stain, back issues, and hearing loss. This sort of behavior can lead to chronic pain and discomfort that is hard and not really easy to treat. Now that we have explained and understood this topic a little bit better lets go back to the question that we asked at the beginning, in case some of you guys forgot the question, the question was ""How is technology impacting our health?"" If people really took the time to think about this question that we usually always leave unanswered we would have known that technology isnt impacting our health in any positive way, technology actually makes us stressed, makes our eye vision bad, gives us back pain, hearing loss, and a lot of other negative outcomes. Another reason why people might feel depressed when they use technology a lot, is because they dont really interact with people and dont have any friends since all they do is stay at home and do everything on their device. Its scientifically proved that every human being need at least one or more friends to talk to every time they feel down and dont feel really good about something. That is the reason why most of the people that use technology a lot, sometimes feel depressed and dont really like to interact with other people around them. In conclusion , technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a negative effect on peoples life and if people dont learn how to control and manage their time and not use technology every chance they get, our next generation will be exactly the same as this one right now .The sad thing about the limitation of human contact due the use of technology is that there is no turning back at this point we are in a society where technological innovation and progression is the norm; It would take a minor miracle to reverse all this disaster. In order for all of this mess to get better, people need to start learning about how to balance their time even if theyre using technology, otherwise it is only going to get worse and many people will start feeling pain in their back, getting sick, feeling depressed due to the lack of interacting with people and due to the use of technology.

713,713,D9E7B148EF8C,"I DISAGREE Hello there!!! do you know that Albet Einstein is one of the smartest person that ever live, he discover by using knowledge and imagination. Then he said this "" imagination is more important than knowledge."" I disagree because you see you use imagination and knowledge in the rest of your life, when you work as a team you use imagination and knowledge and you need to be fast, strong, and smart, and imagination and knowledge is important. OK let me explain why i disagree what Albert Einstein said. First, when you was a kid you use imagination to make things, to draw, to make discoveres, and to have fun. When you grow older you will get knowledges and use it to pass your test, do your homework, and more, but you use your imagination too. For example by thinking, to brain strom, to make music and more, is the same thing however you use knowledge with imagination. Both imagination and knowledge, you have those things from your rest of your life!!! Starting when you were a kid and when you grow older you still use both imagination and knowledge, thats one of my important reason why i disagree. Second, you use imagination and knowledge when you work with somebody or working as a team, making something or thing how can we make it stronger or how can we win. if your working as a team and battling a robot battle you use imagination to think whats the best robot to build and how to make it stronger, that one of the examples. If you play sports you use knowlege to think what to do, how to win, its the same but you use knowledge. However theres a battle that you work as ateam, using imagination and knowledge, it is a war!!! let me explain its beacause you use imagination to know whats the plan, what is the things were using and knowledge to know when to attack , that one of my reason, when using imagination and knowledge in a team you need to be fast, strong, and smart. The last one, imagination and knowledge is important, because imagination and knowledge is both important because if kids cant imagine theres no knowledge or if there no knowledge there no imagination. Every body need imagination and knowledges to do what they want and both of these is fun like they can make things, they work as a team, and it will be at there rest of there life. This last body or body 3 is conneted in body 1 and body 2 this is the most important reason. If theres no imagination theres no knowledges, both of does is important every one need imagination and knowledge.

For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldnt give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test. You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing its more likely to be true than the one that doesnt. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when youre working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong. Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you dont understand the information or dont have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just dont understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and thats what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didnt have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them. If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure its correct and the best.

Much as the technology developes the people will be seperated from each other. Tesla just intreduced Tesla Model X. It has an auto pilot mode. Self driven car. Also they announced they making tunnel just for the auto pilot mode. Elon Musk says ""its much cheaper then the normal tunnel and safer"". And he mentions on his tweeter ""Working on something"",""flying car picture"". So he is already working on the new tech. Its only 2019, can you imagine how technologies would be in next 10 years?. It will be keep developing and devepoling. It wont stop. We will get to some point, we dont even have too see each other or talk to each other. Nowadays kids doesnt play outside, they have their IPad, Xbox and PC. Even the babies got IPad. If you give the baby IPad, the babies would be distracting them selves. Its much easier for the moms too. But some point kinds gets addicted to it. Crying and sometimes they just wont eat anything. Smart phones can be really dangerous to the eyes.

717,717,9EB7D09C785B,"Take classes Online can help busy students, but is you are interested in take this classes can help you too. Take classes online is a good opcion for busy people because some times they do not have enough time to make food, do the homework and go to school, sometimes they need money so they need to work, and they look at this like an obstacle that keep them away from school. By taken classes online they can make a better sketch, eat at home, do the homework, have more time to do the things that they need to do at home. For example if you have a baby, you can take care of you baby, and they the classes olnine at home. Also, if you need to go to work, you can go to work and in your free time take the classes online. Another reason is that some students live far away from the school, and they do not have a car or transportation, is more easy for them to take the classes online in the comfort of their home. Also, if they are in a normal school and they want to keep learning by the summer they easily can take the classes online or the video conferencing. In my opinion I think that the classes online or the video conferencing can a lot of students, if they are busy or if they are interented in this classes they can take it too.",6,5,5,6,4,5,2120,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
718,718,A570CD64F0F9,"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, ill be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something. First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends. Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it. It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jrs ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day? In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

Is good idea to take classes online or not good idea to take classes online? It is a great idea to take classes online, this is in my openin because it is fafe the students times. Like (work in deffrent time ) (Famileis responsiblity) (Sickness and transportion) work in deffrent time sa we all know that work that may effect the time of students becaue is impossible any work places give the students the schedule that they want it. So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax. Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends. Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So thats why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere. Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online.

This mean the students will have three days to sleep well. Then, if they add 2 hours more there will be some consequences. If the Students dont sleep well, they will be sleeping in class.

721,721,3B81809AA132,"""Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something"" yes people accomplish more when they are doing something. I believe that when people put in the effort to do more things that, it could help accomplish more for them in life. The reason why people accomplish more is because since day one theyve been working hard and every chance they had of doing something productive that it would help them get to where they need to be in the future that they would take it. They knew that at a point of time when they get a job that they would have to take care of their parent when they older. This is why our parents always push us and tell us to do better in school because they already been through our situation and it took them the hard way to learn and they dont want us to learn the hard way they want us to learn the easy way so that it would be easy for us to get a scholarship. Back in the old days when our parents were growing up they didnt have no technology to learn they had to struggle to learn, they didnt have no bus to take them to school like how we do now days. But back in the old days is was easier to get a jobs and it was easier get into colleges because all they needed was a GED. But now we need a Masters Degree, and a High School Diploma just to get a job that pays good enough for us to live by yourself and to start a family. Now it very hard to get an academic scholarship because now you need at least a 3.8 grade point average (GPA) to get an academic scholarship. This why we need to be always doing something so that we can make our parents happy and also make ourselves happy that weve made an accomplishment. These are the reasons why i think we should do more, push ourselves more to get to where we need to be in life as a teenager because our parents cant keep telling us the same things over and over for us to listen we should just listen the first time so that we could make them happy and take care of them as when we get older and into our adult stage.",6,7,6,6,5,7,768,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

But No, Educators shouldnt make students break year-round school, where there should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, and a week off in spring and fall because they dont have as much time spending with their family and most students also have responsibility. The first reason is that they dont spend time with there family. School is taking there time when they go back home. Students comes everyday day at home to do their homework and make sure they have everything ready for the next day of there school life. Some even has projects to work on. While the student is only worry about that; they forget about there parent for a while.

This is especially convenient for older ones because they are weak and stressing themselves could cause heart diseases and even death. But now they sit home and order anything, saving their health. Secondly, technology has gone to the highest level. Today one could stay at home and socialize with friends and family without physical contact. Technology has provided social media apps making it easier to communicate without making human contact. Besides communication, people feel safer talking about their rights, the government and politics in general on social media than in public.

The yearbook like take pictures of all the teams,clubs,or groups the school has. or take photographs of all the teachers of the school like put what they do or what they teach students. School coincuals like take a photographs of them and write on the top what they do there names favoryte thing and others. And sports i do agree with the principal is for students can learn to do team work conumect with others and trying there best to win or at list not loss the game thats how they can learn and it shows the teacher how good there in one thing then the other .And students council i dont now what that is or what it means but i think if like to help keep the school or help janutors, teachers,or the principal with something. And i agree again becaude people or example students need to get on shape learn how working out feels like and then when they grow older they would be like ""wow"" because school is not just learning math sciences sociol studes and laugen arts no,school is a aportuniti to now how life is and how it is ti work hard and trying our best to do or conplet something on life.

The students that are in sports they can just stay after pratising with other students on the soccer filled. And for the student council students can just do what the student council dos because i have no idia what is or what it means .

Whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you dont even know can give you some type of guidance. It always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. Independence is very important. Having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. Also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. Understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier. People need to learn from their own mistakes. Mistakes happen every day. A persons instincts may not always be right but it will benefit them in the future. Another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something.

Help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. As well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. However, a persons own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. And know whats best for them. Who knows you better than you? To conclude, its all about self perspective.

Or do you just go outside for a walk? Studies have proven that 75% of people go to parks more often during their free time. These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside. Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isnt a really competitive game and can be played alone, its better when its played with other people. Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isnt usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids. Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch. Though you could still play tag being a quiet person. These are some examples of what to do when you ever want to go outside, or to the park.",9,8,10,9,9,9,3585,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

736,736,3A38B9DD6723,"In every success of a person there is always a humble story of how did they start from the beginning of their journey. At some point, being successful does not mean you have gone through a lot of struggles, but it was destined for you to be successful. In every story there are different types of story because it is based on where you came from, what education you have finished, and your status in life. However, I agree with Churchills statement because success comes after failure. Failure is really an important role for every success. If I fail, I did not hesitate to stand back for myself to pursue success. The greatest blessing in my life is being successful after I have gone through failures. For instances, Graduating high school, I wont be graduating if I did not fail and try harder to reach my goal. At some point of my life, failure is within me because I am not making any move to pursue my planned success. Planning ahead of my success is not bad actually it prepares me to become a successful individual, if I will fail at this time maybe planning my success is not a good idea because it was planned and I know what kind of success is waiting for me. Id rather be a failure with clean conscience than a successful cheater. I conclude that in every success of a person is within you. You hold your own fate. If success is really for you be thankful of what kind of success you are receiving at that moment of your life. Be humble, keep your feet on the ground.

An example to a problem is that you have a scholarship to a great university that is far away, but your family needs you to stay close and help them. Some things may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, youll try hard to fix it. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you cant prevent them from happening. You learn from your mistakes to do better and you always try whats best for you , it may lead to a better path, as Duke Ellington said ""a problem is a chance for you to do your best."" Problems happen to everyone, the real deal comes to how you will respond to it. Many people take their time when they deal with something troubling, they all have their different strategies too. They all have one thing in common they do what they think is best for them. They try to see if it will help them and what they could use to an advantage to be better. you would never do something to hurt yourself on purpose, you will need to think things through to see the outcome. Sometimes things do not turn out how you want to be, and you learn more about the things you will do to make things easier. There are times that problems involve more than one person, and wont effect you only but others as well. It can be friends, or family, it could even involve people you dont know. An example is that you got a great scholarship to the university of your dreams, but your family doesnt want you going far away and need your help. your education is at risk, but your family needs your help. Youll have to see what outcome there is to both of the situations and what is better for your future. Not all problems have an easy choice but they bring out the best in you and help will help you in some way, they build your character. Some problems may seem impossible to fix but hard times bring the best out of you, and youll try to fix it. There are problems that make it seem that you cant handle it alone. There are people that can help you, youre never alone. Even if you try your best it may not be how you want it to be, there are others who will help guide you, to have a good outcome. All you need to do is stay focus and look forward, so that you can keep your head up. You never have to do anything alone, you might need the help of others and its okay to do so. There are both big and small problems but a problem is a problem you cant prevent them from happening. It happens to the best people and there is no way to stop problems from coming. It doesnt matter the size of a problem, you should never underestimate them. You have to try your best when a problem presents, sometimes what seems right can turn out very wrong. You need to think if others will be effected, you cant just ignore a problem sometimes it could become bigger. It is also a chance that you could show others that you know what you are doing, after analyzing a problem you do what is best.

I have, and I say we as young adult should pace ourselfs and not rush this important life decision so early. Because that decision de the person and the time, not important for take one career. Each young person has a decision to purse a career or not because it is optional. First of all I disagree whit this idea, because young students are more like to listen what adults tell them to chose. That ends up on kinds chosen careers they dont want or like and in the long run it takes away their Dreams, money, and time. The kinds need more inspiration for that in future they take one career like: doctor, arquitec, teacher, and other carriers is good have one inspiration. Is good have persons that support in every time like Mom, family or dad. Because much young not listen the adult or not have support in the family for that reason they do not pursue a career. Secondly us young adults need to expand our knowledge in the work field. Like for example we need to watch videos and have people already working their to explain How they work and ward they do. It would be a good idea to have two examples of people: a person who has ready finished his career and has work and money and the other, who does not finish his studies and asks for money in the street. Is good what a young thing in her future the difficult is life outside working in the hot or cold not is nathing essy. Everybody have that thing in her future, on good future for the family, wife, sons, daughter. Is good have idea in the High school that like you.

742,742,FD48D4BB6F06,"Students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. First of all, this will let students be less stress from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they cant do during the day. Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you wont have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students wont have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about whos right and whos wrong. In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and wont be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students dont have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out. Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they wont be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel.

743,743,895FFC078777,"More is always done when we do what we need to do, other wise we get lazy and say ""Ill do it tommorow"". We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important. Its good to have a mindset where you like to get stuff done, that shows that youre an honest person, and it can really say alot about a person. When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then were suppose to. Doing nothing is easier then doing something, but doing nothing has a bigger consequence then doing something. Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. There are Entrepreneurs around the world that didnt wait to do something with themselves. For example, Bill Gates, he is the richest man in the world with billions of dollars to his name,but how did he manage to get all that money? by doing something and not by doing nothing, doing what he needed to do, when it needed to be done, not waiting for tommorowto do the tacks that he needed to do to get where he is today. Bill Gates was always busy doing something to get stuff done for a company, now hes the owner for Microsoft. Doing something will always bring positivity around you, into your life, another example is Steve Jobs. Steve Jobs didnt wait to do something for himslef, he dropped out of college, but it didnt stop him from doing what he wanted to after that. He stayed in a small garge, worked day and night to invent a computer, the MacBook, with this computer, he was going to become a famous Entrepreneur. A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. Steve Jobs is a great example of how much great can come by doing some. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting. So we have to get stuff done so we wont have to worry or stress about it later. to conclude my essay, we should always do something the moment we get the task, other wise it will never be done.",7,6,7,8,7,7,1823,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Although some say students should not commit to a career at a young age because make students feel pressure. In most cases students become stressed because of their parents telling them to start selecting a career at a young age. Students behavior change; However their grades get affect it bacause of the stress and pressure. Some people say that school should talk to students parents, so students dont feel pressure selecting a career at a young age. When the parents know they have a lot time before collage. First reason why students should commit a career at a young age because help students preparate for the future and let them know what is better for them. Students preparation is base on saving money to pay for collage. They can see what is better for them; In other words what career benefit them more and if they allowed to pay it. Students can know early where they can get help either from their parents, or if they has to work for the career that they want. Students can talk with their parents aboout a student loans too. Second reason why students should commit a career at a young age because they have more time to look for a career that they like more. They have more time to look for a career with the charateristics they like. Students have more time to save money. They can know other careers where they can get a good pay. Teachers can help students to get a good career base in their Knowledge. In conclusion students should commit a career at a young age bacause as I said helps the students to preparate.

The first reason why I enjoy the beginning of gym is because you can walk around the gym and talk to your friends. . And not have to wait to talk till lunch to talk all you want.

Another reason why is that I love hanging out with my friends or to hear about there problems. talking helps you feel much better and lonely so i think that talking is fun and important at the same time. then the other reason why I like gym is because we get to play fun games or activities sometimes. Because I like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities.

I like going outside because I like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. It is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football.

My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want, A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didnt pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success. Other might say that success and failing isnt good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later. According to a quote that say You can loss a battle but not the war, In fact we can loss everything but not our enthusiasm. In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchills statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and dont surrender dont give up with our goals, always been happy doesnt paying attention to the situation.

750,750,3E156DCB07C7,"We accomplish more when we are always doing something not when we are being inactive. There are many people out there who are most of the time through out their day are being idle and never doing anything, theyre always sitting around and wont do whats the best for them by trying to at least accomplish something in there daily life. Although some say being idle does not serve a purpose, actually being idle does serve a purpose, rather you should go out and accomplish something better for yourself. You might say being idle is not the good for you, but being inactive can sometimes be the best for you. Thomas Jefferson said that ""Determine never to be idle."" Thomas Jefferson doesnt realize that the reason being idle can sometimes be good is because you might not notice this, but in your daily life you can be doing to much for yourself to the point where you wont even realize how much you have accomplished. Once in a while you should think to yourself what you have done and accomplished during the week or day, it makes you think that you may need to be idle and put some time away from things that you usually be doing. What myself believes in is that you arent always going to be doing so much for yourself in your daily life on what you want to accomplish in. Sometimes you need to put it all away for a short amount of time and give yourself a break and just be idle for once not for such a long period of time, but make time to do your own things. One thing that is true about being idle is that it serves a purpose for being inactive, but the reason why that is good because you can always go accomplish it another time and you can come up with thoughts or ideas, for later on when you want to accomplish it. However, in my thoughts always being idle isnt good for you because you may have time to be idle, but you dont have all the time in the world to be idle. It would then just keep you away from doing things that you want to accomplish on, Which will then make your mind not want you to do things in anymore. In my perspective what myself believes in is that being idle for to long is such an impact on your life because when you take your time away from the things that you usually are always doing and have a daily schedule for it makes you forget what you had going on and what you were trying to accomplish in. Thomas Jefferson said that ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Which is true because you can get so much done if you are always doing, and it is wonderful like Thomas Jefferson said. Youre doing a lot of work and accomplishing it all by succeeding in the things that you need to get done, and its an amazing thing to do because you rather do it now then doing it at another time and put so much stress to yourself. In my opinion, accomplishing it at the right time is better than accomplishing it at a different time. To explain what my opinion said is, do it at the right time when you have the chance to do it rather than doing it at a different moment of the day. It will makes things much better for you because its better to get things over with now. You wouldt want to worry about it later on it would then just make things much more of a problem. Additionally, in my thoughts being idle keeps you away from doing the things you want to get done, it makes an impact on yourself on what youre trying to get done and it can distract you from your work. Something that is true is when youre are being idle, it keeps your focus on staying in the moment that are in which is doing nothing. An example of being idle is staying in bed all day on your phone. Why would somebody want to be doing that when you can be out accomplishing your goal and succeeding on what you want to become in life. Thomas Jefferson also stated that ""Determine never to be idle"" if you were to never be idle you can accomplish so much and keep on doing what you always do. People shouldnt let themselves get distracted by being inactive, they should take an advantage of all that and think rather than being idle they can be out accomplishing there goal and reaching for somewhere better. In my opinion, people should do more to get to where they want to be in their life because if people are doing that then youre definitely accomplishing something better for yourself. In conclusion, although some say idle does serve a purpose and should be accomplishing their goal rather than being idle. In my conclusion people shouldnt be idle because it will easily distract them from doing better things and accomplishing their goal, and it wouldnt be great for everyone. Once in a while people would get inactive way to much and just forget about what they have to do or accomplish in. Many believe being idle is good for you, but it can lead to a bad habit of you always being inactive and no want to achieve in your goal. In my statement idle does serve a major purpose in peoples daily life and can just keep them away from doing what they do. Some say people should accomplish more on always doing something and shouldnt get inactive.",5,6,6,6,6,6,800,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
751,751,C693AA305835,"Should some high school districts allow high school to graduate in 3 year instead the traditional 4 years? yes, i think high school district should allow students to graduate in years. high school students should graduate in 3 years because most students have all there credits,they can go to college earlier, also you would have another year to explore new things. Most student have all there credit by the 3 ears of high school so which mean i think they should be able to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 years because they would be wasting another year in high school and they would have been able to go to college and so they can can already be studying what they want to become in the future. Student who graduate earlier they can start going to college earlier it can be benefictional for you and people should take advantage of it and they would get college done faster and you would be almost be set on their career and moving on making money because every one want to go to college and e Third reason is why school should allow students to graduate 3 years instead of 4 years because students would have a year to explore and try new thing maybe find a little better part time job save some maybe even rent a basement or something In conclusion high school students should graduate in 3years not 4 years of high school. Some say by graduating early you would not be getting the full experience of the four year high school but there are benefits when you graduate earlier. In the future i think school students should only have to go to high for only 3 years. ",6,6,6,7,6,6,2695,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
752,752,12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that Ive grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field. My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion. The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship. In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me. ",10,10,10,10,9,10,259,"conventions 10, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 10"
753,753,F075F9AD2AA4,"Do you think it is a good idea for the students to commit to a career at youg age? That is a good idea because the school will give the opportunity to know more things. Also, is a bad idea because some students have a lot of things to do after school, they have responsabilities example; they have to work, they have to do things in their house, or many things what a young can do. I choose students have to take the career at a young age because: They will be ready when they have to work in that career, if they going to take the careers that they prefer it is going to be good, because they will practice and they will learn a lot in of that ,so they will focuse everyday in that career. The most important is they wont have any problems when they have to show everything what they learn after they did finish their career. It is a good idea because is not bad that in some societies the students has to expected to identify a career by the hight school, because about that form the people can know what is his/her specialty, or what work realized in the high school ,if that person was good or bad in that career. Is good that person know what he/she wants to be in the future, because some people dont know what they want to be, what is their dreams when they become adult ,but some people know what they want to be ,and what is their dream job. Is very important to know that you want to be sure about your future because this opportunities are not in every where we have to exploit the things the life give us, because when I was a little girl my dad alwas plead me that I enter a couses like English, computation,to play guitar, dance, and many things ,but I always respond no ,because I just wanted to play and that set , but now I know the importance to learn ,to know ,to make something ,and show to the world that you know that you can do that ,and nonthing in this world is impossible. They will have the capacity to learn more things about the careers what they will going to choose. Also, the school will give them the opportunity to work in the summer or after school, this idea is amazing because in others countries like my country there are not career to choose in the schools ,the student are not ready or they are not ability to work in something because they dont practice nothing in the shool they dont know anything .They just study and dont have elective courses that ways, the student in my country dont work usualy the parent are who work. The conclution is that the students have to take some career ,bacause is very important for the societies also for them, they will be capacity to know many things. Also, they will be ready to make the work what they choose in the hight school. And the student wont have complication or doubt to may complete their job. Finaly, the students will have a profession in something that they can make very well, but this courses is not just to show to the others persons the career that you took in the high school. This career is for you ,for your future more forward. What happen if you can process with your study, this courses is an advantage in your live.

754,754,4EE0B81B9133,"You are in trouble. As your teachers might tell you, behave when you are in school. That includes in the halls, cafeteria, and even on the school bus. By following simple rule that are established for your safety, you wont lose your school staffs trust. Behave when you are in the halls. when the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Dont take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause a traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. Its not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if its an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision. Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isnt only respectful, but its even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, dont run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary. Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus its nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you dont have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, dont yell across the bus.

755,755,BF72FB4B953F,"Three year graduation Is it beneficial for students to graduate a year earlier then the rest or could graduating earlier impact a students health? Many high schools allow students to choose between graduating in three years or the traditional four years. Some students accept this offer with the idea of leaving early and not dealing with drama. In my opinion early graduation is not worth the mental, physical, and emotional stress. To start off, when you choose to graduate within three years you are choosing to work during summer and do all core classes for junior and senior year in one semester. you worry so much whether you are going to pass or not here is where stress applies. Generic_Name, a college student at John Tyler community college, was suppose to have graduated last year skipping her fourth year but, unfortunately she couldnt keep up with everything. She had to do all her junior classes in one semester and her senior classes during second semester causing her to stress and have a mental breakdown in the middle of her Biology class. After consulting with her guidance counselor she came to the conclusion that she will have to do her fourth year of high school for her mental healths sake. Now with that being said, transitioning from junior to senior year is hectic. You have to make sure you have enough credits to continue: make sure you keep up with all your classes and their requirements: and you have to stay up late studying and doing homework. A young adult needs at least 8 to 7 hours of sleep to properly function through out the day. A student that stays up doing late night homework and studying do not obtain most of those hours leaving them with only 2 to 3 hours to sleep;therefore causing them to be tired all day long the next day. The lack of sleep has a big impact on a student who wants to graduate early, for they fall asleep in class and miss out on important notes. In addition, the simple attempt to graduate is emotionally stressful. Now imagine only having one year to do both junior and senior classes. Once again you worry about passing but this time you question yourself. You ask yourself "" Am I capable of making it? and Am I smart enough?"" and dwell on these questions. Eventually you start putting yourself down and start thinking whether you made the right choice or not. This is where your emotions come in to play. Meanwhile you are trying your hardest to do all your work you start feeling angry at yourself because you simply can not keep up. Soon enough you give up on everything your education and most importantly your future. On the contrast, for many high school students graduation is an exit ticket. The faster we manage to graduate the better. We no longer have to wake up early in the mornings, we do not have to interact with students and their negative attitudes, and we no longer have to be caught up in high school drama. but even though graduating early seems glorious it is not worth all the emotional, mental, and physical stress of doing both years in one semester. In conclusion, three year graduation is more than just saying "" lets do it!"". It takes away from your sleeping schedule; stressing you out when you fall asleep in class and fail to copy notes. Causes you to worry so much whether you are going to pass or not and mentally stress. you eventually start to question yourself, feel insecure and emotionally stressed. Graduating early seems glorious but once again it is not worth all the stress. ",9,8,9,8,9,8,2581,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

757,757,F0116D8BA334,"Do I agree that my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some of this businesses have adopted a four-day work week, without thinking about the consequences. Each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources which it would be difficult for them since they will be working ten hours per day during four days of week. Taking the model of the businesses expending school day to conserve energy and resources, with each day consisting of two hours will be a difficult choose to make. First of all the government need to be part of this decision, and need to be include to see which are the consequences going to be in taking this choose. personally i am fully disagreement with this model, but not only myself is in disagreement there is a lots of people that believe school should not follow this model to conserve energy and resources by expending the school day two hours. The government and society is the one whos need to be taking control of this decision, because they know what is good for the students and what is bad for them. In a society it is unlike the average American work week, so it would be difficult for families to adopt to the changes. Having longer school days and shorter weeks does not align with the structure of a typical parents work schedule. Most students being involved in extracurricular activities after school, and not being able to drive, the four day school week will create many conflicts. Parents will most likely struggle to get their children to those activities and anything involving life outside of school. Most parents would have to adjust their work schedules to accommodate for the new school hours. Also, an extra day off for students but not necessarily for parents and child care would be required for the younger students on the extra day off. Additional expenses such as that are not always easy for families to come up with. Lots of changes would be put into action. Some others believe that the positives of changing to a four-day work week outweigh the inconveniences brought on by extending the day. Their main rational revolves around improving to transportation, building and it will be good for students to be able to have more down time. Taking part of this i would argue that the benefits seen so shortage, like a lack in the amount needed. In real world application of this plan applied in a education settings does not posses the same bonuses. The advantage of having another day off most likely Friday, while promising, does not necessarily means a day without work to do. In fact, there is a lot of many ways that you can conserve energy and resources, some business adopt different ways to conserve energy and many resources. Although i do not like this plan that our school should fallow this model (their plan is so bad), if we start doing this plan we will be in a several problem. We usually go to school seven hours per day, and barely have time to do our homework after school. Students like me need to go work after school, since some of us are living already on our own and this plan will affect our jobs. In conclusion the idea in adopt a four-day work week, is not the best plan to conserve energy and resources. This plan is not the best plan that this businesses company have came with. There is a lot of consequences that need to take care of, before get into the point that you can not have the right for a opinion of what to do and what not to do. In this plan i will rather say that the school should not follow any plan or anything that is not for the goods of our students. Speak with the society about it and then make a choose that it is going to effect for good or bad. Sometimes changes are goods, but not on this plan people said that there is some benefits and what i see is just disadvantages on this plan. Adopt a four-day work week, is not the only you have to save energy. There are so many ways to conserve energy and resources. Example: not use a lot of water or try no to use the electricity that much last, but very important think first and then do the use the plan or the choice that is best.

Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesnt work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car.

They have to learn everything by culture and family. Every culture has different impression but we have to caught it because we are human. Everybody has a lot of impression. Many people would have different opinion about this statement. In my opnion, I am disagree with that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture, practice can change anything, and they are adjustable. First reason, I believe that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture and culture change impression. One person has more than one impression and different culture has different impression. People make comfortable with new impression. For example, I born in bangladesh but I live in USA. I have a different impression than before becuse now I am live in new culture, they have new impression. Almost I forget my old impression because USA culture change my impression. People help us to change our imression because whatever we see around us we can hold it. Another reason, I am not agree with that first impression are impossibe to change because practice can change anything. People dont want to do whatever they dont like. But if you do everyday whatever you dont like oneday you will like it because practice can make anything perfect . For example, my friend who came from bangladesh without family even she disnt know anything about this place. But she have to do everthing her ownself. Everyday she is practice new culture thats make her to learn new impression. Now she doesnt remember her old impression becuse if you practice everyday new things. You will forget old impression becasue she doesnt preactice her old impression. Finally, I disagree with that first impression are almost impossible to change because people are adjustable. In the world, people are the only things who can adjust themself to any other new things. When we went to the new place we have to do lot of new things. Even we have to change our impreassion because every place has different kind of impression. And people can adjust themself with new impression. For example, people impression are like water. Doesnt matter where you put water it will be shape like where you put water because water is liquid and people mind is changeable. When we go to the new place we have to have change our impresson and it doest matter who you are and where you are. In conclusion, people have to say that first impression are not impossible to change because people live in culture, practice can change anything, and people are adjustable with new things. Most of people wouldnt agree with that statement. We dont have to believe that whatever other people said. People has a right to say whatever they believe. Human beings are adjustable with impression becasue we are changeable. Whatever we can imagine we can do it. Everything is possible for human.

When you get advice from more than one person its usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advices is to either improve or be successful. I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision. First getting more than one advice can help know what advice is useful and what advice is not useful. Second you can a lot of advice from more than one person but you combine all the advices you got into one big advice. Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial and it can help you come up with your on decision on what advice is good for you.",7,8,7,8,7,7,2193,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

I agree with Michelangelo that you dont need to be the best as long as you put effort in to it you can do anything but at the same time i disagree with this quotes because you dont need your setting to be low it can be high at the same time it really doesnt matter how you can achieve your mark no matter what way or path you decide to take life take to different place makes you do different decides.

766,766,70E490A83717,"To begin with many students enjoy summer than winter. Making winter break longer than summer and a week off in spring and fall is not a good idea. When students come back from break regardless of the season they most likely cannot retain information, because they have been gone for a long period of time. Having a longer winter break than summer is a waste of time. Why should educators feel that a longer winter break than summer could help retain information? In my point of view having a longer winter break would not be enjoyable students like the fact that they can be able to enjoy their break. Even though students cannot retain information on learning targets, at least it wont waste time because having a longer winter than summer would extend time causing time to be lost in the school year. Changing the season of the break would not be enjoyable either cause of cold weather, it would certainly not help students to remember the information they learned when they were in school. Whats a break if you cannot enjoy it? In addition what maybe the students can take into consideration is to review some of the things learned, during the free time on their break. Teachers should assign online classes and reviews for students to help memorize information at least once a week. That way when people return to school others wont be so behind on things and can remember the objectives taught. A longer winter break could possibly help the scholar remember what was learned, if they were to revise and analyze work that was given to in the past in this situation. In conclusion changing the season would not help students retain information and is not a good idea , unless the individual were to spend time studying a few times out of the break. Overall there should not be a longer winter break than summer. ",9,8,7,8,9,8,1463,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Students will learn more if they go to a regular school and they can help them self to be active in school or participate from sports, club member and etc.. Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because students will learn more if they go to a regular school and students can do more better or focus if theyre in the regular class/school and they can ask for a help from their teacher or their classmate. The most important in a regular school is that you can ask your teacher face to face about your grade or your missing paper works on her/hes class. For example, Sarah is more likely to attend on a regular school more than an option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because Sarah is more having fun to go to a regular school to see her teacher, classmate, and her friends everyday. This proves that Sarah is glad that she improve herself for everything especially for all her achievement in her life as a student. Students would benefit from being able to attend a regular school because they can help them self to be able to improve them self to be active in school or participate from sports, clubs member and etc... Being a students you need to enjoy your life as a high school students because once you graduate or go to college you my not or my regret yourself for not trying/try to involve yourself to join some sports or clubs member etc.. For example, Enrique love to play basketball went he was a child until hes grow up, but he never try to involve hes self to join the basketball team went hes on high school because he always said that hes not enough or not that good to be part of the team thats why he never try to involve hes self at least one. This prove that involve yourself to any sports or clubs saw you will not regret yourself at the end.

768,768,C8EF7048C03F,"When youre looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one persons own opinion. One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur. Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others peoples opinions about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if its gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the ones in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help others or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the ones need in teaching One dislike I dont like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best.

Students would feel better if they had a better rest, or knowing they could do school whatever time they feel good. The students would get less distracted if they learned from home because they are not around their friend or peers, who are usually a distraction. Of course the students will get bored of being alone while doing school but its better for them to stay focused on what they are doing, and plus they have a better understanding on what they are doing if the students dont get distracted. The students would be more dedicated on the homeworks, tests, or projects because they would understand a lot more if they are not distracted by their friends. The students would learn a lot more if they are comfortable for example people pay more attention when they are in their rooms on their beds or when at their house. Students would rather sit on a comfortable chair rather than a school chair because when your sitting on the same chair everyday your body starts to hurt, or you dont feel comfortable sitting in that position.

770,770,04B6FD84A066,"Aiming for small goals and accomplishing them are pointless. although, it is not a bad idea to make small goals and achieve them however, aiming for a bigger achievement will help in the long run. Achievements that are harder or much bigger can teach you a lot during the process of failure. In my opinion failing at long term goals is more beneficial then achieving small goals. One reason why failing at long term goals is better then to achieve a small goal is that you keep learning when you fail it is a part of life that you need in order to have success. For example, You might never succeed or progress in something you havent failed at, failure helps you learn to do better and not make the same mistakes. Achieving small goals is not a bad idea but to fail while trying to go your hardest is better because that is your full potential and it helps in your future. Aiming for easier goals does not help learn about failure and you need failure to be successful and experienced. Having long term goals is the better way to go. For instance, you can have a goal that can go on for a couple years and when you accomplish it it will feel way better than something you didnt fail or get tired on. Long term goals also help you plan ahead and really perfect your craft or perfect what you are trying to accomplish. Having a goal that you can easily achieve does not help you with learning because you dont fail and it does not take tie and experience. For example, a goal is something you have to push to achieve, so if you dont have to fail and learn it is not a realistic goal. Accomplishing and working on something you know you can achieve is not really success. Goals are achievements that are supposed to benefit you. For example, if my goal was to learn how to swing a bat it wouldnt be better than my goal wanting to win the world series. small achievements come with big goals you can learn how to swing a bat while you are training for the world series. Aiming bigger will help you accomplish more then just your goal . It will also teach you skills like patience and practice and that you will accomplish small goals on the road to the big goal. As you can see, I agree with what Michelangelo said about aiming low and accomplishing your goal because when you aim low you dont really have a challenge or real goal. You dont get to experience failure and having to do so much to reach the goal. Aiming higher and failing is when you put your effort and you fail but when you learn from that failure and keep trying to achieve the goal in different ways you will achieve it as well as other small goals along the way.",9,8,10,9,8,8,61,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Not everyone likes high school year, therefore it is the great way to graduate early and accomplish to get into your dream college school. This program that let you take courses during the summer can be a great option to finish high school quickly, the aim of this study is to, so students get out of high school, and have enough time to start processing and think about what want to do in college or start working to help out their parents on necessary things, such as, bills, rent, and etc. However, not all student would take this action, it emphasized that students may not have time, it can affect their sleep schedule, and not completing school. Some, of course, may think that youre not learning fulfilling, for instance, regular school year is like ten months and if one take the programs, youre only taking extra courses during the whole summer, thats like saying youre missing a whole ten months of school. In addition if I were to take this program, I would really do as much as I can during the summer courses, and courses to get extra credits that i need for the colleges that I;m applying to. and soon Ill start working, and apply for a scholar ship, also applying to universities or colleges that i would like to attend to, In conclusion, many people may not agree or join the programs, we all have different opinions, different beliefs, this program can help many students to start off thinking majors,work, so therefore, Id recommend students to take this offer, and see where it can take you.

777,777,234F1BA430B7,"Why is it important to learn the experience from others? Its important because you know what youre going to do or you know what youre going to see. For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw. When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what theyve expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because theyve told you what theyve experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad. So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesnt want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when its his time to shine. Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like youre new student and a bunch of girls see youre hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think shes so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isnt as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

780,780,D2EBEB5FDA90,"I believe technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. The reasons are,they buy thing online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for them. Purchasing online things are not always great. When you do purchase it online sometimes they dont always tell the truth and when your getting phones or other things like clothes or makeup. These thing you never know if its used or brokering and if someone could of warn it too. Also food that are buy online are not fresh and they could Carey germs. Take for example when you go out you look at the food to see, which one is good and which one is bad but when your online you cant tell what your getting. This cause people to become lazy. People become lazy because of how much stuff there is on online and games, TV shows. Therefore people rather watch a TV show then go out with there family. This is bad for people because this can cause people to become depressed,more stress about online chats and what there saying online or watching a TV show;but you wish you could be that person. People will stop going outside. Take for example YouTube, YouTube is the most used media but also there are non-stopped videos they can go on forever and people stared to thing they have to many things to do. This cause peoples communicant with others harder. YouTube cause people to give up. Communicating is becoming harder for people because they dont face to face talk anymore. Now they use phones more. Phones are used for texts ,calling. So why is communicant important? Communicant is the main thing in your life it brings people together and you need it for jobs. Jobs where you have to work with other people and help people that buy from you. Take for example Generic_Name is the co work and Generic_Name is the costumer,Generic_Name doest talk to people that much because she texts more ,therefore, when Generic_Name came up to her ask for help. She didnt help because she doesnt like talking to people. Therefore,technology has limitation human contact with other people is a negative effect on our lives. I believe these are the reason,they buy things online that are not good and they start to become lazy,communicant becomes hard for people. Peoples need to use less technology and try to open there self to the outside world and hang with there friends and family or read books. Some will still choose to use technology today.",5,5,7,6,4,6,2929,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

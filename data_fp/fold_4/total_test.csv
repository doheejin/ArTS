1,3129,C71E82A97BD3,"Is it true that people can often credit their successes to having a good attitude? well yes it is, I have seen people like my uncle become successful in life because of their attitude. I have also seen people go from being successful to being unsuccessful. Some benefits of having a good attitude are that more people will like you another reason is that people will want to hang out with you and the last reason is that people will respect you. Having a good attitude will get people to like you. It will get people to like you because you wont be mad all the time. It will also get people to like you because they will tank your a wonderful and positive person. Thats why I thank having a good attitude will get people to like you. Having a good attitude can make people want to hang out with you. A reason why is because you wont be boring and will have positive things to talk about. Another reason why is because maybe you can make people happy or make their day by just saying one word. Thats why I thank that having a good attitude will make people want to hang out with you. Last but not list having a good attitude will make people respect you. It will make people respect you because you will treat people with respect and theres a saying that says treat people how you would like to be treat.

2,3130,1B4C8AD95EB5,"""Unless you do something beyond what you have already mastered you will never grow up."" I actually agree with this, because some people are just stuck with what they do , and they dont want to try new things; they are just so used to what they have been doing for years, so they are kind of afraid of doing something new. Its just like making new friends in school. Kids are really used to their friends that they rarely talk to new students. This might apply to Ralphs words because some people dont really want to change their routine, or because they dont really wanna change their life style at all. Another example but a little more personal would be me, I love riding my bike, I feel like I could ride it for hours without getting tired, I tried to do skateboarding for a couple months but I ended up going back to ride my bike, because I was already used to be riding my bike so I stopped trying to learn how to do skateboard. I would say that its like a feeling of being afraid because we think about it, we think about its pros and cons and we also try to adjust our schedules to see if we have time to do something thats not in our routine already or if we can just replace it for something that we already know how to do. I feel that to succeed in life we have too be willing to try and or to do things that are new for us like a new type of sports, a new hobby, even a career as long as we are interested on them. Where Im from Eni Ayuwoki means ""do and get stronger"" back there people use to believe that if you do more than one thing that is helpful not only for you, but for everybody in your community you would be the most important and recognized person in the area. So in conclusion for me that makes sense because I dont really enjoy having the same routine every single day, I like to switch between activities to keep my mood up. I dont think anybody likes to do the same thing over and over again.",7,7,7,8,7,8,359,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
3,3131,0CB1237268E3,"A positive attitude is the key to success, and everyone should agree at this point. People who choose to be in a successful way, always try to be positive toward every situation. Every person in this world wants to be something that could be remembered forever. To get to what they want to and dream about to achieve it, they must need to work hard, be prepared for everything, and always should be prepared for things that might be impossible to do but never give up on it at any issue. Life gets hard sometimes and gets easy by the time, but it depends on what people choose to live with. Those who choose to live happily works hard, always have positive attitude toward everything. But those who want to be successful but not working enough on it it will get nothing from it. people like ""George Washington"" who are still our heroes are the ones who knew how to get through tough ways by a positive attitude. We all have different habits, we are all different, but we can change the world through our positiveness, not by being mean and not pretend to be working hard for our needs and wants. Positive attitude the something that helps us get ride of our daily problems, doing something in a good way makes is a way to our goal becoming true with no tension. If we want to make our dream come true we have to make it in a good and positive way without hurting anyone, and by loving everyone. the only thing everyone absolutely have to know is that a positive attitude and thinking positive is the way we could get ride of our bad habits and live live in peace. We cant make it through our hard times if we just sit there and dont do what we should to ourselves and other needy people. We all have to be patient, not everyone gets stuff so easily, to achieve something it takes time but we all have to be prepared for things we will face. We might wont make it through in our first try, but we should never quit trying. Everything takes times and have its own limit to get fixed. There are two things that are above all else, one is work hard, and the second one is work hard in silence but in a positive and a good way. positive attitude is the important thing in our daily life. Its not that we have to be 100% so we could get all we want, we all know not everyone in this world is perfect so we have to do things by what we really could do, the only thing that would help us in everything is positive attitude. Nowadays everyone think they could do everything without trying the best they could, and try it in a positive way, but i think they are wrong. If you want to get the same respect s everyone else you need to have a positive mind toward every different thing in this world. Whenever things keep goes wrong we need to ask our selves that are we doing what we suppose to do, are we being what our parents and our country taught us to be, so that way we could stop thing to go from right to wrong and stay positive in every way. before we start to do something new we need to ask someone that is experienced, so we will not get lost in the middle. Never give up on anything in this world things are not hard, we are the ones who makes them difficult to do. We are not pot in this world for keep quitting things to get to our goal, we are here alive to create change in world, to love people, to love the tradition, to keep doing positive and effective things for our generation and the upcoming generations. We are born to make people smile. We are not for hate, we are for love. We all should be trying to change the negative thought to a positive thought. When we have problem to solve, we need to think twice and think positive because that solution would defiantly impact others too. We should all try hard to be in a metier type place. In my opinion everyone should be thinking about how to be successful, how to be something better, how to make others feel better, and make them pot him/her as an idol. we all should always take responsibility for our action and consequences. If you want to be something memorable you have to be the change what others would like in you, and you are the one who could make it through hard and tough ways by a positive attitude. We are the ones who can change the world by just be different and make things easy and effective in a good and positive way. I know we do not want the world to go for hate and negative way instead of a positive and right way with full of benefits. If we want to work somewhere and we dont have control on our bad behavior and have negative attitude towards the boss and other workers we will not be successful, but if we do have control on our positive and negative attitude we will always be successful and always would get promotion in every place we are. Only a positive way could effect us to achieve our needs and wants. ",5,6,6,5,6,6,169,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
4,3132,6F3C318ED62E,"Of course that im agree with Churchills statement, because for to have success or to be successful in the life you need to have many failures. No one is perfect and you dont need to be it for be successful. This quote reminds me when my grandfather used to tell me "" Son, if you wanna be someone important on the life your gonna have ups and downs, dont matter how many failures your gonna have, but however, in spite of everything your gonna achieve your goals and dreams without matter what other people says about you, the most important is not loss the enthusiasm"". I think that if you do your best on everything and you try to do it better always your gonna achieve your goals. You dont need to do it perfect all the time, because despite everything you always gonna have a failure but that doesnt mean that your gonna stop try to do your best or your gonna loss all your enthusiasm, its mean that despite of each failure your gonna follow your goal. No matter how many times you need to do it, just try it!!!. The failure plays a important role for be successful, everybody has ups and downs, for example: In the school, if you have a test and you were studying for that test but you fail, dont stop just try it again and try do it better the next time. For a job, if you are searching a new job and you completed many applications for any job but no one is requesting you for a interview, or unfortunately, you not were accepted on that job, dont matter, you will find another job, just dont loss the enthusiasm. In a relationship, if you like a girl or boy and you declare your love at her/him but you not were accepted for her/him or whats more worse she/he doesnt like you, dont be sad you will find the right one for you. In a career, if you wanna have a important job like lawyer but you have a failure in the progress, dont loss your enthusiasm you can try with another profession like nurse or another that you like it. In the life, i say in the life because i have a stepfather that he always says that he is right all the time when its not true but he never want to accept that he are wrong and thatt a problem, because if you never listen at the other people that are right then your gonna have a failure in the future, for the same reason that you thought that you were right when you doesnt. Be successful in the life is not something easy at the contrary its hard because in the progress you always gonna have many failures, but however, nothing is impossible in the life with enthusiasm and to much effort you gonna achieve many big things, always fight for your dreams and goals. Remember nobody is perfect on this life and you are strong and intelligent dont matter how many troubles or failures you have just try to do your best and fight for everything that you want. In conclusion to have failures is not bad at the contrary is very good for you because you learn more about how to do it better the next time. My mom always say: "" Each failure its make you more strong and more intelligent "", and the truth thats true, you never gonna learn about your error if you dont have a lesson for to learn but everything without loss of enthusiasm.",6,5,5,6,4,7,1451,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
5,3133,FFED00D6E0BD,"Do you think that failure is the main thing for people consist on their goals and success without lose their enthusiasm? I agree with the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success in life because, I think failure is the main key to people reach their goals because they need to have the idea that after failure came the success, secondly they need to be positive and have in mind what they want and how they want to reach their success in life, and last they have to be prepared for failure, and they have to be prepared to confront the failure because they need to keep in mind that not everything is going to be in the way they want, but at the same time they always need to have in mind that everything is possible with effort. First, people need to have the idea that after failure came the success, because everything happens for a reason and if something goes wrong for certain reason in the moment when they try to success they need to accept things, and keep trying. They need to be really patience for example, when babies are trying to walk they fall many times but get up and they keep trying until they reach their goal which in this case is walk or, there have been many cases when people have car accidents and they lose the ability to walk thats something that does not stop them they keep trying even if take more than a year they dont give up because their goal is to be able to walk again, their goal is to be the person they used to be before they get in that car accident, and they just want to be able to keep doing all the stuff they used to do before all the tragedy happens. Secondly, everything depends in how positive people is because, if they have a negative mind and always act like their goals is something impossible to come true their not going to accomplish nothing because people need to have the idea that they can make true everything they want, they dont have to be thinking in failure cause the more you think the more afraid you get to encourage yourself to make things happen and they have to try every day to improve and look for the resources available to success in life. Finally, they always need to keep in mind that there always would be a chance of failure and they have the right to be afraid but, thats something they need to live aside and they need to be focus on their goal, they need to have the power to stop themselves whenever they want, and they have to be the ones to say to their self to stop when they think they already accomplish what they want but, they cant let people decide for them. Because sometimes people get jealous to see the other ones success in life and they try to guide people into failure. In conclusion, there have been nothing that cant stop people to reach their goals and success in life because everything is possible, people have to believe in them self and always be positive they always need to keep in mind that they are capables of everything and they need to learn to not give up. In that way they would be able to do everything and be successful the key is always have and excellent attitude and be prepared for people to judge, and be prepared to failure and get up and make it see like their have been nothing wrong and keep going. They need to be positive in every movement they make and be positive in the way that everything is going to be exactly how the planned.",7,5,7,6,6,7,3911,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

9,3137,4844CF56336D,"students who take an online classes do not have much benefits because, they feel lazy to study on their own, sometimes do not their assignments and also do not have people they will be compete with. They also do not have much confident to speak with lots of people or give a speech in front of many people, which makes someone who attends an everyday class with a lot of people to be experienced than a person who takes an online class. people with much experience in a lot of things do not always have fake people in their lives. People always think that taking an online class is very good, which is totally wrong. When taking online classes you do not get to know the people who are performing much better than you in class, but when you go to an everyday class in a school, you know the people who are better than you in different subjects. When you take an online class you do not get people who will help you solve your problems in much courses; for example, when you take an online class and you fail in a subject you would not know those who performed good in that subject, that means that you will not know how to study hard to perform good next time. Online students always find it difficult to study because, they do not see their mates in school learning which will also encourage them to that same thing. This means that taking an online classes will not be advisable for students. Also when taking an online class, you do not get to interact with different kind of people through out the world. People who take an online class do not always have the confident to speak in public and do not always have lot of friends. Having friends is one of the important things in our life. When you have friends you share each others problems and solve it together. This means that when you take an online class you do not always have enough friends to speak to or to share your problems with. For instance,when you are given the opportunity to give a speech in front of a lot of people, you begin to shiver or start stammering because you are not use to speaking in public. but when a person who attends classes which involves a lot of individuals, they always have the confident not to only speak in front of their mates but to also speak to those who are much older than them without any fears. Moreover, people who always involve themselves in a video conference do not always know the people their dealing with in their business or do not always have much idea about their business meeting. When one is present at work place all the time, he or she runs the business smoothly without any misunderstanding with anybody. Again when having a business with someone on a video conference, you do not know if the person you are dealing with is a fraud a fraud or not. So people who do an online businesses always end up putting themselves into trouble. When one is always present at their business places, they always know the people who are hard working and can make the business go much further and those who are lazy. When you are always at your work place,you make your members to respect and adopt your policies. People who take online classes do not understand much better because, the teacher is not always around them when they need help with the topic that they not understand. But hen you are in an everyday school classes, when a teacher always teach and you do not understand you always know where to locate him to ask for help. Even when the teacher is not around, you can find different teachers who also teaches that subject and they will always find a solution to your problem. So students who attend an everyday classes perform much better than those who take an online classes. All the above mentioned, which includes, it makes them interact with different people, find a lot of friends, get to know good people in a business, ask teachers for help when they have a problem really shows that taking an online class or a video conference is not really beneficial for an individual. Once all these measures are taken into consideration, people will see that going to an everyday class or making yourself present at a business meeting is more important to a person.",9,6,8,9,8,8,946,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 9"
10,3138,211699D25472,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson when he wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". You need to show to everyone what are your ambition to improve your life, and if you dont show to the World what you can affort, do not put any complain to someone else for your fault. You always want to know what are your own limits. First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too.

My opinion is that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. There are many reasons why I think the above. Sudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. Student want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. I think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives. Strudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what intesrests them. For example, I do not like to take music, it bores me. I would rather take drama. People are very diferent from each other. Such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. We just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. The reason why I think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. For example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. They can be taking another math class. If thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. Which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything. Students want to be doing many things that they love in school. Yes, that is very true. CLASSES THAT ARE FOR FUN SHOULD BE ELECTIVES!! Not required.

12,3140,A0BC5780C987,"Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you dont want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend. Going to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their ""safe spot"" which the safe spot would have to be far. Another thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because its fun but its very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they dont mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If playing a sport is boring and not interesting to someone, riding a bike or a scooter is an option. Riding them is exciting and fun. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then its fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. If I go out to bike or scooter Im with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see whos faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter. If going to the park or playing a sport doesnt interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. If youre with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. If youre walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if theyre any near by, or the flowers. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if youre wanting to do something that includes being outside and you dont want to do anything then walking, running. and sky watching is for you. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because its very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically. Going to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if its low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally.

13,3141,4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we dont even need it because were to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on peoples lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things. In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. Thats when kids want to isolate themselves and dont go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they dont even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and dont even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on peoples life and causes them to have depression. Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that its not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life. Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing its just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital. In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. Its usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People dont even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but its only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home. Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we dont even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on peoples lives because can cause people to lose theyre touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and peoples physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away.",7,7,8,8,6,7,1002,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
14,3142,8A0A3FE01FE7,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Many believe sitting in a classroom is better for students education, but others believe it more reliable for online or video conferencing. Distance learning wont give you the same benefit as sitting in a classroom. Its more reliable to sit in classroom because if not you could fail, system can shut down, and youll be getting more physical help in a classroom. Many like distance learning because its more flexible, but because its really flexible a lot of people have a higher chance at failing then passing. Imagine, a lot of people dont like waking up at six in the morning to get ready for school, so what would you expect from a student who stays home. He/she could wake up late and still miss there class which means theyre missing the material and education they need. Others irresponsible students will forget about the class and they wont care on doing the work. They will have the mindset of ""its online, i can finish it later"". Many student fail to do there work because of laziness and for being irresponsible. Especially, if the weather is nice outside many students tend to make plans and wont have the same attention towards school like before. In the other hand, if the weather nice outside and students go to school , sit in a classroom, in the afternoon they wll be able to enjoy the weather and get there work done.. Numerous of computers systems shut down because of many different reason. If this were to happen to a distance learning student, they wouldnt be able to log in. Some systems take hours, day, and maybe even weeks to get fixed. Other computers have trouble accessing internet. Without any internet, no student will be able to do any online class or video conferencing. Another problem with computers are, that the power goes out. If you computer or any cellular device is not charged where would you be able to plug it in? How would you get your classes done? How would you turn the things you need in on time? These are a few question people dont stop and think about. Therefore, because of these troubleshooting problems it best to go in to a classroom. All students have many different learning skills. Some prefer physical help instead of visual learning. Learning the material physically is way more reliable to learn easier and faster. Physical learning can help people get there work done faster, easier, and not get distracted by other things around them. Students can be more focused on their work and get it done on time. Others say the environment in which there in doesnt matter as long as there focued , but to other people it does matter. While students are at home they can easily get distracted and forget they have work that needs to be done. this will cuase many students to fail and would have to retake the course. .",7,9,8,8,6,8,1831,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 7"

Kids wont learn because they are going to say why did they put more school time and thats all they are going to say the the whole time. It will make it all more busy for the teachers they will get mad and say how they cant do that much hours they got kids they got thing to take care of. The school will need to whast more money on food and electicion bill just for one more hour of education and kids wont even learn alote because they will be to busy complaining and say that they want to go home. the school board will just wast money for no reason. school is doing good already so do not mess it up by an hour of school. The teacher will work more time ,so they will get paid more. So if u do put one more hour of school if a kid needs to stay after would they stay an other hour of school that would mean that the teacher would gets a bigger pay cheack and that would be alote of students so teachers would have to stay for ciuds to so that would be longer and by the time its done it will be dark. The school will need more volnenters because they dont want to pay teachers more already because they already do because they have an other hour of school left so they will have to beg the teachers to volnter to to stay. School will need to think of more thing to do in the school to fill up the hour. we will not want to go to school. we will be so tired and and to know that we have an other hour of school i would be done for the day. I would not feel like going to school every day because i would be more tired . it will give me less free time to us because we got sleep earlyer because we are tired. we will get mad because we dont got free time alote and that would effect our school day. Kids will feel that school is to much work and might tell there parents and the parents might tell the school to lower it down. The school will will get complans form parents that there kid is stressing to much so that would be bad and school will have to cancil the one hour. Thats why i think it is a bad idea to put one more hour of school all of the people will disagree i would to because it will just make me stressed out and give less free time. I think school should leave the hours alone since they dont have to deal with the work and tired ness they dont have to think twice. I think it is dumb to add an hour more because it can mess up every thing. If every thing is doing good then it should stay like that if we need to change it we should all chose if we want a to have one more hour or not. We are the important voteers so why leave us out of it. We are the ones who get tried ,so one more hour and 30 mintues is not good for are bodys even worse if you have after school or a clud. The money that you had to use for the extra time could go to better things like new computers for us. Or it could help for better lunches or better gym oqupment or mucic things and make the school better by painting it or somthing. Instead of wasting it on one hour of paying teachers. I would like to have free time not streeing out about doing work and being done and haveing little free time.

Workers always need to plan it out before proceeding to the task or assignment to finish or complete. For example Generic_Name wants to figure out how to complete his project, he need to plan step by step and what materials he needs for the project.

All of us always have to something to complete any tasks or assignments to finish. Its not going to work if we dont always doing something or plan it out , its the reason why if you wanna get it stuff done you have always do it in order complete it. For example take school students for a example, they tend to always to get work done so they can free time to themselves and usually making sure the answers they write down are correct to get good grades. School students have determation to complete classwork theyre assigned to, so later on they dont have to complete it for homework at home for free time.

32,3160,3F3DC123EDF6,"Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble, or do they unfairly interfere in young people lives? Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves. First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff. Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents. Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age.

Thats why I think students shouldnt have school extended one hour and a half so they can have more time to do there homework and have more time to sleep, and so that they can have enough time to play video games and play outside with there friends , and finally so they can spend time with there family and do fun activities with them.",6,6,6,7,7,7,1510,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

35,3163,CD81F6CCE819,"I believe that self-esteem comes from achievement because the more a student work hard, the more achievements he/she get so when they receive more awards and/or achievements, it makes them to proud of their selves and build true self-esteem. There are so much students who works hard, complete their work on time and also have a part time job after school, but they dont know how to build their true self-esteem so what they need to work is that they must be self confident because they cant build their self-esteem unless theyre self confident. Also, there are much more students who go to school and dont have a job or anything after school or during weekend and theyre self confident, but dont know how to build their self-esteem. So, students should try their best to receive achievements because it encourages and/or makes them to build their self-esteem. Self-esteem is something that students can build it by theirsleves if they work hard, be punctual at school and have a checklist or a plan for what they should do first as a calender. Students arent working hard nowadays I have no idea that its because technology makes them lazy or they dont want to plus theyre not trying to achieve something at school. Im sick and tired of seeing these kind of students because if they just open their school backpack and at least study for two hours at home, they will receive a lot of achievements at school so thats how they can achieve their goals. So, when it comes to build their true self-esteem, they need to work on achievements and become self confident first and then best version of their selves. Teachers also have a role in this issue because I think students spend more time with their teacher compare to their parents in a week. I dont mean teachers discuss with them to build either their self-esteem or self confidence unless the student is smart and curious to ask his/her teachers and peers about becoming like a person who has self confidence and already built his/her self-esteem. But, at least they show students the right way to get achievements or achieve their goals so that would be enough, and students will start thinking about how to get achievements and then theyll probably start working on their self confidence and self-esteem. In addition, when I came to the united states it was 2017, I didnt know any English and I didnt have any friends at school so everybody knows how hard it is to go to school and can not speak with anyone or dont have friends plus I was a shy guy. When somebody was trying to talk to me, my face was becoming red and start blushing so its all because I didnt have self confidence. So, I am still trying my very best to learn the language and make some friends at school so I can play or do my work with them together. That being said, now I can speak, write and read very well and I became so much more confidence, best version of myself, have a lot of friends, and so happy to attend school. Overall, being self confident and working hard for achievements are like a key for building students self-esteem which comes from achievements. Students should focus at school or wherever else they study so they get achievements which helps them to build their self-esteem. Students also should be encouraged by their parents to build their self-esteem as well as by their selves unless theyre self confident in life.

36,3164,EEEF07B3D146,"Do you accomplish more when you always keep yourself busy? In this essay i will argue that keeping yourself busy serves a purpose. You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things. When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score. You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless. You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy. Some people say inactivity serves a purpose, but they are wrong because when you are always doing something it keeps you motivated, experienced and makes a good habit to have.

The teenagers have to much homework and some teenagers have work after school, and finally we have a little free time in the night, but all this is more fast and easy thanks to technology, because the technology make more easy some things, for example if the homework was in paper without technology, we need go to the library for buy pictures, colors, history and more materials and that take more time and we need wait for somebody, because we need ride, finally without technology we are spend money and that take more time. However, some people think the technology has negative effects and we dont should be use the technology because when the family want eat together sometimes everybody use the cellphone int he table, and they dont have a good relationship, but the technology is big help for many things, for example the technology is big help for contact with friends or family who lives in other place and the technology help when we want got to other place and we dont know where is the address so, we can use Google maps, everything you need, we can find with technology.

39,3167,04659704890C,Having a good attitude is important if we want sucess. If you dont have good attitude in what were doing then we can never get the things that we have to do done for for instance if I didnt have a good attitude everytime things got hard I wouldnt have done the things I did. Take for example If I wouldve had a bad attitude everytime something went wrong in my life I wouldnt be as happy as I am now because we all go through difficult times but how we choose to handlle it is way different. Take famous people for example if they wouldve given up everytime people said horrible things to them they wouldnt Have as much money as the do now or famous as they are now. People who dont have good attitudes dont want other people to have success because they wish they had a good enough attitude to do what others are doing. If we decide to have a good attitude we can get more things done and accomplish way more then anyone else. Its also nice to help other people with theyre attitudes. By helping other people we can have way more success its just simple if we want to accomplish more then we can help people with theyre attitudes and help them get way more things done. Another example I have a friend and she didnt have a good attitude about her grades but she didnt want to work hard to improe them so I told her if she wanted to get her gades up she had to have a good attitude about them and she did the she started working harder and she improved so much. Having a good attitude in life can help us out so much when we want to sucessced. It is important to have a positive outlook on life and not focus on the negative things. If we focus on the negative things to much we may forget to look at all the positive things in life. Its better to spend our time enjoying life instead of worrying about our problems alot. After all we only live once and if we spend our whole life being negative then we wont be happy in life.

43,3171,CD1D7EC5810C,"It has been asked by one teacher about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. Work is the ability to do something that given by any one it can be a person, a company or at school that we do it by ourselves or with group. One scientist said that, ""one country can developed not by the Prime minister(President) its by working together"". Although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work. Some people says that working alone is more beneficial than working in group because they learn how to accomplish things by themselves. In our world almost all people struggle to accomplish their work by their own, which is good to learn many challenging things in our work. For example, Thomas Edison invented the light bulb with out asking for help, he also fail many times to passing light through in the bulb. Also Leonardo Davinci took him more than a year to draw the most expensive and beautiful woman Monaliza, but he didnt ask anyone to help him. We can do any thing by ourselves if we work hard and struggle not to fail. Actually Working with group is more beneficial than working alone because more ideas flow out from another person. In Biology our nerve system can stuck when we thing over and get stressed, the last level of stress is stuck. One person can do one or two things but if another person help him they can have more ideas. For instance, the two brothers who made the airplane, now a days we can see what kind of airplane made. However because of they are two they mix their idea and get it done. Time is short in this world. God gave as the time interval to do in our inter life. Bible says God gave 900 years for Adam, and when the people become a lot the time interval became more less, and now a days the interval for our age(time) is 80 or 90 in average. When I came to my idea, it is limited by shorten time to complete the work when we working with group. Lets give an example for this; the teacher gave an assignment for each student to do research about global warming, he gave 1 month to submit it, but if they had work in a group they can easily do it with in less than a month. In this world we stay for shorten time interval we can work together to accomplish our goal. although some says working alone is more beneficial then working in group because they learn how or accomplish things by themselves or responsible for that work, actually working with group is more beneficial than working alone because we can get more ideas from other person and it is limited by shorten time to complete the work.

First,students will be stress out. There are different kind of people in a school,some may be fine when it comes to sitting for a longtime,others may have problems. Sitting down for more than three hours can cause waist and back pain. some students may be sleeping while the teacher is teaching. Example;if a teacher is teaching and the students are sleeping,the student will end up not hearing what the teacher said about the topic. When this happens,the student will end up failing the class which is not suppose to happen. Again,most of the student will not get enough time to rest after school before going to work. There are a lot of students in high school who work and cater for their living. Majority work after school,therefore,they have enough time to rest before going to work. If the school hours is extended by two hours,they will not have enough time to rest and will be sleeping later in the day in class. Example;some people do not close early when they go to work,those student get a little time to rest before going to work. This idea is important because,it will help teachers to complete their syllabus in time and also rest on the fifth day,and get time to be with their kids. some subjects involves a lot and needs much time to complete. Teachers always rush when they are teaching just to catch up the syllabus and students will not understand the concept they are teaching but when two hours is added to the time,the teacher will take her time to explain for the students to understand the concept very well. I will conclude by saying,adding two hours for a four-day week school has a lot of disadvantages,therefore,my school should not follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business or else it will affect the academics of the students,and also weak the body since they dont have enough sleep.

45,3173,C76DBCE18AF0,"Many people think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree with this statement, because first impressions is something that is hard to change in your life. And when someone tries to change their first impressions they always fail. First impressions are the reasons why people dont get along because they think different about each other. In my experience on first impressions are always bad, because when Im going to talk to someone and the first thing I do before talking to them is judge them in good way. For example, if Im going to a new school and I go my first day of classes, and I dont know no one in that school, and I want to talk to someone or be friends with someone, Im going to have to talk to people in the new school, and before I talk to them I always think if they are good people or bad people. And if think that someone is bad, but in reality she/he is a really nice person. That is an example of first impressions. I think that if youre trying to change your first impressions is going to be difficult, because you cant change something that is going to happen before you meet someone new. First impressions is something that every human has in their lives and they cant change it, because is a part of their lives. Even the animals have first impressions, because when you are trying to buy a dog, the dog is going to have a first impression because the dog is getting an owner. So thats why First impressions are almost impossible to change.",6,7,7,6,7,8,2707,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
46,3174,424005E31A04,"Do people ever told that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life ? Well,that true for you to be success in life you got to have a positive attitude . when you talking around attitude is how we act ,talk ,and how we deal with thing that are happening. Say that person you are working with and the person next to you do or says something that is not so great, and let say that you were really mad and very upset about ,and you choose not to fight or talk back to him/her. In my preview I would say you act base on what happen and you had a positive attitude about what just happen. Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just dont want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I dont think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What lm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person theyre so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you dont if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until its end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other cant do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person. Being kind to someone,helping people,and making people about you happy and it can also make you happy. why ,because you have a positive attitude and when you success in life you will be happy. The thing is when talking about positive attitude can be the key to success in life, is like you are talking about happiness is a wonderful thing that happen in a world and make people happy. So when saying key to success in life your talking about how you act ,respect,what you do?, and how will you success in it when your looking for positive attitude so that you can success. Their are not a lot people who have a positive attitude in this world,but their are people who are bringing positive attitude in this world. When you think about success in life do you think it would be great if everyone had the chance to be success in life ,but to be fair life is suppose to be hard that way we can learn from our mistakes. Positive attitude help you be success in life ,because we live we learn everyone is a learner in this world.

48,3176,BB5D6C14712D,"I agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because, the more the try the more experiance they will get, they will get more power, they can cortrol people, and they will get freedom and respect. Most of people are scared of losing or failing. They think failure is the end of the carrer. For example most people when they fail in business they give up, or some people dont try things because they are scared of the unknown. One of my mintor alwasy telling me the more you try the more experiance you will get. For example i tried many types of business and i failed on some of them like i tried to do real estate i brought a house and i lost $50,000 because i didnt know how much the house worth. Also i tried Bitcoins and because i joined late i lose $7,000. But i never said ill quit, what i did is i got a mintor his name is Generic_Name, he is doing real estate and i leanred a lot of things from him and one of my friends is good on bitcoins so i asked him to teach me and he became my mintor. After you get the experiance you will get power and what i mean by that is it will be hard to fail. For example Bill Gates is a powerful man in business do you think he will be in debt? the answer is no it will never happend because if he lost everything he made other people will help him to success again and everybody want to work with him. Then, you have to have a control because you dont want other people to tell you what to do. for example who has the cotrol in the hosptal? the doctors or who has the control on companys? the ceos. The reson why they have the control is they are more succesful, or more educated, or they are powerful. Another exapmle if someone has a company he will have the most cotrol because hell be the most powerful person in the company. The last thing you will get is the freedom and respect. As a business man what i mean by freedom is you can go where ever you want when ever you want, and what i mean by getting recpect from people are two ways the first one is when you are more educated than them and when you make more money than them. At the end success is like the marathone, you dont want to be the first preson who get it but you want to enjoy it.

49,3177,D2DF0FA5218C,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives? I believe that it is a negative way for people to have too much technology, one reason is because, people get to be more lazy, another reason is that people dont put much effort on what they are doing, and the last reason is that people get to be shy or nervous whenever they go out. People get to be more lazy on the way that technology can bring them everything to their doors: clothes, food, kitchen stuff, etc. They can do everything by only moving one finger, they dont have to make any eye contact with others. If people are always using technology they are not going to put much effort on what they are doing: paper works, homework, projects etc. They just can copy and paste stuff, it is better what they have in their minds, talk with someone else about it, socialize with others so they can have more ideas, one person can explain it to each other so they get to understand it better, be proud of what they did and not what technology did for them, see their skills. Sometimes people get to be shy or nervous when they go out because they are use to order things by technology, they are just on their cell phones and not socializing with human contact, most of the stores have machines so they can get to pay without looking or talking with another person, that way people get to be more insecure of themselves when they have to socialize: job interviews, going to college, making a group when theyre at school etc. With technology, people get to be more dumb in the way that technology does everything for them. It is better to get up and explore the world, give some effort on what they are doing, and meet new people. Some people while they are walking down the street, and they see another person coming they just look at their cell phones so they dont make any eye contact with other people. It is really sad whats happening with our society. While some people believe that technology is a positive way to grow as society however, I think It is making the people to not explore the world or socialize with others. Without technology kids would be in the parks playing games with other kids, having fun, exercising, learning new stuff ouside, and not being in their cell phones playing video games, watching cartoons or YouTube videos that is not going to help them in their futures.

I honestly think that seek guidance from experts is better, because you can ask them about how they did to accomplish their goals and also they have more experience about life. First, guidance from experts it can be much better, because experts can give more options, more ideas. Also you can ask them about what you need in life to be success. Also ask them about their life, how they did to accomplish their goals. Because if we are in any situation that we know we could not do it alone , we should ask them about any idea that they will give to us.

Students who took it early can ask their counsler for advices. Many students believe that starting a career at a young age is a good idea because students can go to college after their courses, students can get a job after college, and students doesnt have to worry about making one in the future. Starting a career at a young age is a bad idea because it can cause students to quit their courses, it can cause lots of thinking to make one, and it can cause waste of time. Students will quit their courses. For instance, when ever they went to class and took it for three weeks, they will usually give up. Furthermore, it can cause people to lose interest about their career. Teens who quit their courses, they have a hard time because it was difficult for them to keep up. Therefore, it is important to think first before taking that class. It can cause lots of thinking to make one. For example, it takes time for adults to make their career. In addition, they will mostly think about getting a job first. Adults will usually think about getting a job because they want to earn money first. Not only that, adults like to spend time with their friends, but they make their career after they get paid enough to start their life. It can cause waste of time. In fact, kids will spend time playing video games than making a career. Moreover, they think that career is school related. When making a career, kids will often write ""dont know"" and they will usually get back to their hobby. Thus, it is essintial to make a plan first before making a career at a young age. Making a career at age of twelve or under is careless because it made people over think, it made them go back doing something, and it can cause them negative towards their courses.

A lot of people never try new things like if you are a teacher and after like 5 years you dont feel like to teach more. you can try to be something else that help you to grow more based on experiences because if you try more things like other jobs or try to study something else like gona be rich on experience because many people sometimes get stuck on one thing but everything in this world have a solution but to get your goals is not a easy thing you have to sacrifed many things that you love. For example your hoobies or your family or other events, but at the end of the day you have everything you ever wish becuse you deservet and you work so hard to get it. And you start see the succes that you have. You would see that all you did to get there was correct and that make you grow because you have more experience. Nothing is inpossible. For example if you are the owner of a little restaurant and you want to your restaurant grow more, and more but you remenber that you study bussines and also you work for a restaurant and on that restaurant you were a manager, so you have the experience and if you know how spend money and you make a good marketing plan you can be succesfull and you will growing as a person and as experiences. In addition I think hes right becuase how I been saying if you know more you have experience and you can a have better jobs and that way you growing you have oportunities more chances to be a better on your life and unless you try something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.

The students we should to consider for what they permit us use our cell phone in the class, and they give us the opportunity and dont spend our time and others things and we should focus in our work. Many students when the teacher said you gays can use your phone in the class for search information or some work sometimes that we do is play video games, or see Facebook, Instagram or something else and we dont focus in that the teacher said in the classroom, and spend our time and things that affect us. For example i know a person when i was in my country when we are in the class the teacher said search information in internet that story of this person or when we was in math class, uses our phone for the calculator but there was one girl that she never do that the teacher say and she start to see Facebook and send messages to his friend that are in the same class and that affect the persons who her is message sometimes there is students that they absolutely do that the teacher say or the school and that case, is really good idea use the cell phone cause help us in the class or to have more information about something that we want to know for example in my case i am a person that dont have too much time in this country, and sometimes when i am reading in my English class and find one word or sentence what i dont know what is that means i need search information about that for understand what am doing, is the same in my math class too much times i dont know how traduce symbols and need use my phone for that i think of that way is very good, school permit us use our cell phone too can be the best way for learn more things and makes our work in the way that the students likes also can be more helpful for the students and also for the teachers. I think all depends of the student, use cell phone in class can affect or also can be good idea for learn in the school the school give us the opportunity, that use our phone we should that feel grateful for the opportunity and uses the phone for the work not for other things what can do that our grades come down.

59,3187,168958FC7315,I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day because. Most parents only get off work at 4:00 and they need to be home before their kids. Also if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. First parents need to be home before their kids because. If they leave work early to get home they will get paid less. If they get paid less they will not be able to pay for their kids college. Or out of school activities like horseback riding and soccer. Or even paying for a nanny or a babysitter to watch their kid so they can get paid more. Second if kids are at school longer they will learn more and get smarter. If people learn more and get smarter they will have a higher a chance in getting in to a good college. If they get in to a good college they will have a higher chance in getting a good job. If they get a good job they will get good money to help their families out someday. In the conclusion thats why I agree with adding one and a half hours to school each day.

61,3189,529A633179FF,"Have you ever wondered about the importants and the difference between imagination and knowledge? Knowledge and imagination are both very important but I think knowledge is more important. Imagination is like thinking about something, or putting your self in that situation, while knowledge is an understanding gained by actual experience and it is also known as something learned and kept in your mind. Knowledge helps a lot of people to get jobs so everyone should try to get a knowledge so they can use it to help other people that dont have a very good knowledge. Majority of all the humans in the world get their knowledge from schools. They either get it from a public school which is made by the government or they get their knowledge from a private school which is made by and individual, or a group of people. Schools provide knowledge to students by putting them in classes with students that are their age. you need knowledge to give the students the information you learned, you cant be selfish with you knowledge because you must have been thought by some one, or you must have used someones resources to be intelligent. So if you a good education help other people that are not as smart as you because they can help you when you need it in life. If there was no knowledge in the world there will be no electronic devices that we can use, there will be no new inventions. We are gonna need more doctors to study and find out the cures to all the new diseases that is spreading around the world thats why we have schools and teachers to help. I think all knowledge should be free from first grade to the end of your college year. having to pay for college education makes a lot of students drop out and do drugs and they always get addicted to drugs and alcohol they even try to be you tubers or rappers which must of the time does not work. finally I disagree that imagination is more important than knowledge. So if you have a good knowledge you should be proud to share it with others. Imagination i also good for you but you should focus more on getting you knowledge so you can help others. helping others makes makes you feel much better about your self and it makes you day better.",6,7,8,7,6,7,1078,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
62,3190,33CC5A37AC8C,"This prompt is talking about if we are choosing our own character traits or is our character formed by influences. First you can choose your own character you just got to know about the person life in what the person did back when he was a teenager in what the person became when he start getting older. In my opinion choosing your own character would make you realize about things that happen back then when everything back then was really dangerous for example they had slaves,mudered people, treating people badly, people been racise and more that people did in we still have on this day because people dont want to listen or they just dont care about what they are doing with there life like can we atleast have peaceful without seeing peoepl dying or taking childrens from there mothers. As you can see life from back then was kinda different for example mothers would marry their own children they would have children with their own child they would force you to marry a old man that you dont even wanna marry or have kids with a old guy that you dont even love this why its good to do your own character because you be searching for information that you dont even know about in it be very interested. First of all you have to include for information about your own character or if the character formed by influences beyond or control by anything many characters be having there own influences in you gotta find it out to see about or if they are controlling anything for examples like a kingdom,slavery. and being part of a war. As you can see when been through so many wars in some characters be soldiers or a leader of a war to teach his soldiers how to fight a war when they get into a war. For example british soldiers has fight so many wars with alot of countries they either fight for stealing food or because they own them money they do not want to pay them back or because they have a little issues going on between them in they fight to solve their issues. As you choosing your character you can be creactive with it like you can put somemany things that you need like examples, reasons why you choose this character, get ideas for your character , give alot examples find anything you can so your character can have so many information that it is need it for your character. choosing our own character might be a little hard but we got to find a way to get all the information for it so we can start writing about them in how when find this character interested in we got to know alot of things that this character you are doing has a good information and you want to be curious about. This quote or prompt helps to figure out about a character that you would like to talk about in what to know about it to see if it helps you later on, in to see what they did to help other people about everything that they went through in this help the students to see that been on a war it is not easy because you are trying everything you can to be alive like searching for your own character it is very interested because you want to see about them in learn alot about the in how they did everything they could to help eachother in to see how we fight for the equal rights alot more thngs that we know now. My conclusion- how to choose your own character can be easy for you to write about in to find alot of things and important thigns that you would need for your character when you are putting your examples to a five page paragraph about how this character do alot of things in his past and to see if he still doing ,more things now in then. In by you choosing this character would make you realize alot of things in how everything happen back then when people was just trying to live and survive.",5,5,6,5,5,5,666,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due. First, they can get distracted, In my position I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game. Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone.

If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due. Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have.

65,3193,983D4402B74F,"Not everyone in the world is able to accomplish their dream. There are so many obstacles that make a dream impossible and a lot of important things to give up in order to reach it. The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I agree with Winston Churchill because I also believe that failure, hope, and enthusiasm are the three keys to success in life. First, all the things have two sides. the bad side and the good one, not everyone can see this two sides because of two simple reason. The first reason is because they do not try hard enough to find a solution. The second reason is because they loss their hope. Failure has two side but they are hard to see. The bad side of failure is that you did not reach that goal in your first or second try and you give up everything. The good side is that you fail but you learn a little bit on the way and that the next time you will be more close to reach that lovely goal. Second, some things that i have learn from family, friends, and own experiences is that hope is the most powerful thing in the world. Most people tempt to lose their hope when they fail, while for others that maintain it can be more able to success. When I try something and I fail I always ask a question to my self. The question is What would I be without hope? When i answer that question I feel that all my strength and enthusiasm that I need for reaching that dream come to me. Lastly, a person can not reach a goal without been enthusiast. No one in the world would fight for something that is not interested on. Enthusiasm is what give you the strength and hope to keep trying until you success. Enthusiasm can also be lose by a person when they fail so many times. The thing that make people lose their enthusiasm is the time. In conclusion, in order to be a successful person in life you need to make sure not to lose the three keys. Failure, that help you to gain experience, hope that help you to not give up, and enthusiasm that help you to keep trying. This are the three keys. Next time that you fail just thing about this three keys and you will be able to success in your life.",8,6,6,7,6,8,2015,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

67,3195,1E11EA73C7B3,"Inactivity will most definitely not get you anywhere in life. By not giving up and always doing something, youll accomplish more in your lifetime. Youll learn a lot in the process, and youll also set a great example for others. Theres a good amount of people who are good at something in life, but never get the opportunity like others to be successful at it. For example, sports. If your good at sports nowadays, you can easily make it to the big leagues and have a good salary, if and only if, your focus and show that you want it more than others. You gotta be unique in someway. Because if you think your good enough already and sit back and think that theres no one better than you out there, then your wrong. That means your mentality is not set for success, its set for failure. If you decide to be Idle, youll lose your chance to make it to the big leagues because theres many people out there who are hungry and are willing to take that spot from you. For example, Ousmane Dembele, former Barcelona player, took the starting spot from Philip Coutinho. Because at practice and some games, Dembele showed that he had what it takes to start over Countinho. Coutinho did suffer an injury, but when he recovered, he pretty much became Idle and Dembele was already far ahead from what Coutinho was when he started. When you decide that you want to be successful, its not only good for you, but also for others. Because your setting a good example,for people that look up to you, younger siblings, etc. Id rather die trying to be successful, than not, because then I know I made someone happy, like my family. Trying isnt going to harm you, matter of fact, Itll get you somewhere in life where It will only motivate you to do more, and become a better person. A person like me, would never become Idle because ive witnessed what happens when a person becomes Idle. Especially High School students. Ive seen many students get jobs and lose their interest in school because theyve ""found"" an easy way to make money. And many think that they dont need education, thats why I, myself, havent had the interest to look for a job at the moment. I witnessed my cousin, get a job at Wendys, going from straight As and Bs, to becoming Idle towards school and finishing the year with all Fs and only one D. Thats why I encourage students not to get a job right away when they become 16 years old. I would rather wait for the summer, get a job, and make money. Because you cant also sit around and not do anything in the summer. Everyone gets to that one point in life, where theyll find themselves being Idle, but thats great because they learn from it. They learn whats bad from it, and hope to never be like that. At least Ive learned from it. I suffered a bad injury freshman year, which lead to my downfall a little bit because when I came back from the injury, I noticed that I wasnt the same anymore. My team mates were telling me that Ill most likely never be the same again and that another person was gonna take my spot. I took their words, and trained harder than ever. I became a better player than I was, took me a bit of time, but I got there. And that inspired me a lot, I even started playing with better people so that I could learn from them. I pushed myself out side of my comfort zone, but it payed off. I inspired my brother to also become a goalkeeper, he now trains with me every weekend. Thomas Jefferson states that by always doing something, youll accomplish more, and its a wonderful thing when people acknowledge that. I, in fact agree with him, because when youre Idle, you most definitely wont get anywhere in life. Theres always something to do out there, for every human being. You just have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and do things in life that makes you happy.

68,3196,495A94390744,"Technology is a super useful and daily component we use in our daily lives,however in my opinion technology is being misused and taken advantage of by society. For example your social life becomes different, it gets addicting, or changes you as a person, it shows that people change overall. Those are some of the many reasons why people take advantage of technology. Technology can change your social life, for example you stop communicating with friends and your social skills start to grow weak,such as confidence and being specific while talking. Secondly technology can be an addiction or something people depend on a lot. For example spending hours on hours on your phone or a computer could be consider addiction. While taking tests or quizzes you cant depend on technology to help you and that shows that you depend on the internet. At last technology changes you as a person. Another words whatever you see on the internet it becomes real to you which means, now youre living in a fantasy instead of reality. It also makes you think differently instead of using your brain and you also depend on the internet way much more. Technology can be useful and can save our life sometimes. One out of the two reason why technology is useful is the time your saving. For example if you have to get work sent to your boss, the internet comes in handy, or if you have a project due at school you can also use the internet to turn it in on time. Technology will forever be useful for educational purposes. For example if you need any type of information you can find it on the internet. Theres a lot of things you could learn on the internet also. Technology can be a very inconsistent feature for people, therefore it can benefit people and change someones life in a negative way. Use technology wisely because it brings a lot of negatives with it. Theres many ways to solve the problems that come with the usage of technology. Your limitations to the usage of technology could be lowered so the addiction doesnt get out of hand. The things you use technology for should be only things that benefit you, therefore it doesnt become your social life.

69,3197,5D7D1445A7CF,"Smooth Sails do not make Skillful Sailors! In my opinion, anyone can succeed if they work hard and strive for what they want to achieve. Nothing is a piece of cake. There is handwork and determination behind every successful person. One should have a specific aspiration in their life, and should not do something because they are forced to. There will be a satisfaction if we make a mistake in the work we like to do. We try to find solutions and solve the problem, but if we do something our parents want us to, there will be no contentment. School life should be the time where all the students should relax and have fun in addition to studying. It is not supposed to be a burden to anyone. Every kid has a right to receive the same education and programs. Discrimination should not be shown to anyone. They should be allowed to do whatever they want to, but should be taken care of so that they do not do something wrong. American school systems are perfect for students because they get to study and at the same time they can take courses they are passionate about. They have a chance to learn new things about the career they want to pursue. The balanced system helps them to manage stress level and also concentrate on how their future will unfold. Some schools in the United States also allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years. There is no point in students graduating one year early to work or enter to college soon. How does graduating one year early matter? This increases nothing but stress and restlessness. Some students wish to do that not because they want to, but their parents force aspirations on their children. I do not say that it is wrong whatever parents do, but I say that this is not a right way to expect their kids to be successful. All the students need recreational time where they can forget all the school stress and enjoy their time, but parents desire to see their kids as the most successful person, is not letting them to be happy like other kids. Higher grades always does not matter. All that matters is that how can we use in ow much knowledge we attained from the school and how can we use that knowledge in the future. In order to finish high school early, the kids are required to take summer classes and spare their time in the evening. This is not something that is useful for a kid. They need some time to relax their mind, so that concentrate in their studies. They should be able to take their favorite electives as those classes can help them to be successful in the future. I know an incident where one of my cousin graduated early from high school in order to attend college early. He was really smart until high school junior year. He had a great knowledge of what is happening around the world. He would share those with everyone and help us gain some knowledge too,but at the end of the junior year, he was so into graduating early that he did work hard and finally got into a college. He regrets that decision now as he did not learn so many things in the last year of high school that are stressing him now. If everyone finish high school in the traditional way, they will know everything about college and how it works. Then they can do whatever they want to and have at least some knowledge about it. We often hear news about how students commit suicide as they are stressed about academics, so I think they should not do whatever they do not like, and instead work on what they desire for. Hard work is the key to success, but that does not mean that everyone should work hard on something they do not like. instead they should really work hard to achieve what they want. Our aspirations should not be impacted by anyone. If we have our own goal and ways to succeed them, we should follow that way and make sure that we become the most successful individual in that particular field.

Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the schools work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a schools stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the schools time the students doest have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the schools year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the schools work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and dont take the schools time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Finally, the student doest need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it wouldt be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.",6,6,6,5,5,5,1443,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

In this option there are many people who think this is a benefit to conserve energy in whatever place. I think that this practice could be disadvantage because it will be two more hours of work, between longer day , the estudents will be using more energy in those ten hours every day. Then, we have to use more resources at school for the students be working in class those resources could be naturals, we could be wasting many papers,water when we are in the school and we have to make progress of this kind of resources. Also, ten hours each day we will be wasting resources as electricity every class could be using computers,monitors,tablets, and we have to find a way how to save this resources at school. In conclusion all of this are my reasons and explanation by this model of how to conserve energy and resources at schools.

74,3202,AD175892EC1C,"Attending school and Attending online classes. Attending classes from home by the way of online or video conferencing is not a really smart idea. You can learn better by making eye contact, and asking questions from the teacher rather, than just trying to learn online. Education is one of the most important things in our life that we cant continue it in a good way by attending online classes. Attending online classes might look a smart idea for some learners because they might be able to stay home, and study, but there is absolutely a reason that we build schools. Students might get benifts by attending online classes, but not as they will by going to school. Attending school instead of attending online classes have a lot of benefits that can change an idea of attending online classes. Attending school can give us a freindly character by being able to talk in front of a group of people. When we attend school, we start talking, and communicating with people by the time we get in the bus. We can find freinds, and get help from them when we need. We will be able to ask any question from the teacher at any time that we want, and they can give us the answer without waiting or searching it online. We will get ready for bigger communities such as college and university by attending school. Teachers dont just teach us a lesson, but they show us how to talk in a good way, and how to have a good character in our life. which online classes wouldt help us in such a way. We will have a lot of events at school that we can celebrate with the whole school. We cant celebrate any event while attending online classes. Our chatacter, and the way we are is really important, and attending school will help us to have them in a best way. Talking, and asking questions in front of the whole class or several classes will help us a lot to get ready for college, and more other presentations. Comunicating is something that we will need to use in every day of our life. School is the best way to learn how to comunicate. When we go to college or university there will be a community bigger than a school. Therefore, attending school is a very good option rather than attending online classes. School is not just a place to study books, but its a place where we learn how to live like an educated human. Friends are like family. while we are attending school we will make a lot of freinds but we cant make any freind while attending online classes. Celebrating some events will give us the best memory while we can have that by attending school but not online classes. Attending online classes have a lot of disabilities to teach a student they way they need to be teaching. A teacher can show us how to use a good language with other people but an online class wouldnt be able to do that. A big community like school can make us get used to talk in front of a group of people, while in online classes we are alone. We need courage in order to study. When we answer a question in the class or get a good grade in our class, the teacher, and students courage us but if we get a good grade in online class, there is no one to see our talent and courage us wihtout a small class massege. Attending online class might be good for some reasons. When we are sick or we have a poblem that we cant go to school; attending online class will help us, but not for a long time. Video conferencig has a big different with wactching what the teacher does in class, and what questions students ask. There is a lot of ways that we can study but, attending school is the best way. Attending school is a complete education than other ways. we build schools because we can understand the importance of studying at school. School is a place where we start how to to earn someting that we want, and teachers help us with that by giving us courage. Attending online classes will just help us read something, and if we dont understand a word, then we need to search online for that either, whcih is going to take longer time than studying at school. I strongly prefer attending school than attending online classes because there are many benifits we can get by attenidg school rather than attending online classes. We can not learn all the good things on online classes that we can by attending school. Attending online classes will be a big process, diffuicult, less apportunties, and there is no one to encourage us or show us what is good for us. Attending school is a best way to have a bright future, a good way to communicate and a good preperation for college and bigger communities.",6,7,7,6,6,8,2329,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
75,3203,A2EA2D3D0542,"Have you ever worked individually on an assignment and was stuck and had no motive to keep pushing? well if yes Im here to tell you why working with a group is more beneficial then working alone. I believe working with a group is far more easier than working alone,communication is key. Therefore if you have communication you dont have to do as much work; just have to gather your thoughts and put them together and let it make sense. Group work has to be one of the most easiest things as an highschooler group work assignments are the best,hearing what others have to say can really open up the brain. Sometimes group work may be challenging but it also helps you in the real world which us people need which takes me to my next topic; respecting everyone ideas and having a goal. Group work isnt always about who has the most ideas or who can put it together and what not,Its more of letting people get their thoughts out. Having one or two individuals speaking over everyone can affect the whole group chemistry,making sure everyone is conformable before you start is very helpful of the process. Working with a group you have to come up with a goal;However every goal has a destination. Therefore if everyone in the group has a designated job too do no matter what theyre working towards the same goal. In my opinion goals are good when doing anything when there is a goal to accomplish it just pushes the work ethic to obtain that goal. History shows you that having a destination pushes the brain to do better and has a big effect on the outcome. Personally,as I work in groups I collect other peoples ideas and analyze their way of thinking and use it to my advantage. This helps expands the thought process as many can see a different perspective on things. Its actually amazing how someone thoughts can open multiple thoughts for an individual that didnt even know they could think of such thing,thats why I stress so much about group work it can be rough,frustrating,inpatient but at the end its all worth it. Another way you can think of it;lets say you were working alone and you got your project done,well thats okay but wouldnt you want to know more about whom ever you are? wouldnt you want to get pushed out of a shell and experience new things. Also a group is not always a maximum group of 5-7 people it can also be about just 3 maybe even two. Group work has more pros than cons; criticisms is in the category or pros if were being honest, even if your partner not giving you as much feedback your at least getting something. Than not getting anything at all in my opinion people that work by themselves are just flat out :selfish,hard headed,and think theyre too good for everyone. While people are working alone they could be working on their work place readiness skills. However,some may say working alone is much more precise than working with a group,In some ways they are correct. Yes the process goes faster and there is less to do;as a team may have to do more before they get started. Also you can state your own ideas how and where you want it to go without someone thinking otherwise of that thought. All around working alone much faster than working with a group but if you ever want to get to that next step/level your going to have too sit down with a group of peers and express your feeling which takes:character,time and patient. I have come to the end of my writing I hope I have changed your perspective on things and hope you even learned something with reading my essay. I just want everyone out there to know accepting critsm isnt bad neither is accepting that you are wrong and someone else is right. So take that next step and go interact with others to better yourself!",8,7,8,8,8,6,2182,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
76,3204,880188B5EED8,"People say first impressions are almost impossible to change. I think you can change someone by getting to know each other, spending more time together, or ask them how they feel. If you start talking to someone for the first time and you think their personality is really bad try to know the person more. In my experience, when I see someone for the first time like at work or school right away I think theyre mean from their face expressions and attitude. Sometimes they think the same way too, so they are mean back. You should spend time together and go to places where both of you guys like to go. Their attitude might of changed because maybe they needed someone to talk to and go out more. Theres people that their personality are just different and you have to accept it. Lastly, People go through a lot in life and their personality starts to change. Also, you have to ask them how they feel because sometimes they feel depressed or angry about something and need someone to talk to. Its better to be there for them or help each other out. In conclusion, people say ""Dont judge a book by its cover"" because you never know why they behave like that. If you dont know them, still ask if theyre okay. It is possible to change their personality and make them a better person. ",7,7,7,8,7,9,1806,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I now some people that they copy the stile life from others that is not right, so that is the bad influence. Infuence is when somebody buys things that are not health, like Mc donals, red bulls or chips those are bad influence for you.

78,3206,1D327ADD95AA,"Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on peoples lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started. Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. Peoples phones, computers, and even TVs now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted. Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era. People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed. Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.",9,8,10,9,9,9,386,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
79,3207,39F578D9212E,"An enjoyable place where you can go spend time outdoors is going to the beach because you get to do a lot of stuff. For example, you can get to spend time with your family and have fun with them or with your friends. You may be thinking that the beach is somewhere where you can go and come back that same day but what you dont know is that you can go to a hotel and enjoy the hotel and the pool. You can go eat anywhere you want there is a lot of options you can choice from. There is a lot of fun things you can do for example you can go to the haunted house, the carnival, and the art work they have so you can take pictures with your family or other members. The beach is a place where you can go to relax and get sun tan and go swimming. The reason why you should go to the beach is because you need to have some fun time and not be stress about a lot of things in your life and enjoy the times you have with your family and capture memories with them. One of the most importance part of going is to be able to not be bored at home and do nothing. The beach is a place where you can walk around and see things you havent seen and also taking pictures of where you have been. You can go to restaurants or you can bring food of your own. You could be able to meet new people you havent meet before. There is a lot of clubs at the beach you can go there and dance and have some drinks. You could go to the store and buy clothes,hats,sun glasses, and more. The second reason why you should go is because they have good hotels you can stay in and you would want to pick a hotel that is right next to the beach so you could see a good view of it. There are these bikes you could ride with your whole family and you would all be able to piddle on it or you could bring your own bike or any other stuff you might want to ride. The waves of the beach is cold but it is worth it because the waves are really big and can push you really hard but that depends if you could swim. You could also go to the pool that is in the hotel and be there if you dont want to go to the beach. Sometimes, people would want to be at the beach and stay at the hotel for like two weeks or more but I consider you being there for like about four weeks because you would be eligible to discover new things or see new things. The last reason would be go when its 4th of July because when they have fireworks at the beach it looks really pretty and nice. The beach is a place where people could get married or have a romantic time there and they enjoy doing that. There are people that do there shows there like to get money for doing stuff for living. I would want to actually live at the beach because I dont need to go from where I live to the beach because its really far away but anyways, at the beach there is a lot of great stuff there and nice people and I know for a fact that you should diffidently consider going and not over thinking it. In conclusion, I recommend you going because you are going to have a lot of fun especially with your friends and family and you would remember that in your spending time outdoors you had a good time. Dont forget the hotels,the food, and the pool are such amazing part of why you should go to the beach.",6,7,6,7,7,8,755,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

81,3209,F7FD0CB34BBC,"Everyone has a talent or skill. For Example, my talent is drawing. Drawing is really useful because I can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. To get good at something I enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. Every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly. Firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. For example,when I first started drawing. when I first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness. Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness. Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills. In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill. By practicing,working hard,and constantly doing it can be improve a persons talent or skill.

Although the school board may think that school should be one hour and a half longer, students and parents believe that school hours should remain the same. I do not agree with the school board planning to add one hour and half every school day. School by its self puts a lot of pressure on the students and with a hour added its going to be much more difficult. The school board should not add hours to school, since students are already used to the hours they get out of school. With a hour and a half students would probably get to much pressure on dealing with some school material. Students would also get much more school work. They would also get an hour taken away to spend that time with the family. It would also take time for the students to get used to leaving school an hour later! If the school hours remain the same then students would already be used to the hour schedule, and they would also have time to do after school activities!! Because the school board wants to add an hours more of school, the school board should listen to the parents and not add another hour. It would give students much more stress.

83,3211,296B1DD1E251,"Do yo have a good impression? I am agree, the first impressions are almost impossible to change, because I feel that the first impression is important for everyone. There are many people that do not show how really are, and try that everyone love them, but at the end they show how really are and everybody move away. The first impression said everything about us. I believe that, If you show them everything about you, the people will love you how you are and they will trust on you. Always we need to be honest with you and with the people. My ideology is be honest with yourself and do not show something that you do not are, If you want that everyone show you how really are. I always show how I am friendly, lovely, funny, charismatic with everyone, and also try to help when someone need me with my knowledge and capacity. One of my experience is in my work, every single day new employees go to work in the store and I always help them to know how the store need to look like, and also with the customers I always smile, because I show my first impression with them, and I feel great when the customers saw me with a smile and they said: Hi, how are you today, it is good to see you and have a good one. I have few months working in the store, and I feel comfortable with everyone, because the customers do not know you enough, but they trust on you and they tell you something about his life, and with the rest of the employees we pass fun, We are like a family and we help us ourselves. In the school is a little bit the different, because in the school I am shy, I do not talk with anyone just with my best friends, but I always show my emotions, enclose with the new people in the school, but sometimes they pretend be good at the first time, but with the pass of the time they have different attitude. That happen to me around 2 years ago with different person, the first person I knew her in 9 grade, when the both was new in the school, We became friends and everything we did together, but She change with the pass of the years, in summer another friend and his sister told us what she talk about me and my sister, but I always be honest with her and friendly and she showed me something different than the first time. Then, with another girl was a little bit the same, because she had jealous for my sister and I to had good grades and be active in the school the last year, but she always had bad grades, and We tried to help her but she never wanted, then with my sister and I move away from her because she was friendly with us but she was a bad friend with us. I feel that we need to show always how We are not matter what everyone thing about us. Sometimes is good a new change in our lives, but never changing you essence. Something that I always do is think about my weakness and how can change it to a positive way Finally, I think that We can be success in the life, the first impression will open many opportunities in the world, I know that the good person are these that show a good attitude when you know it the first time, and something in your heart told you that you knew a good person. Everyone will have present that they can trust in you and they will feel great to know a person like you. The first impression is always a good one. Many people do not know me and they think that I am conceited just how I look like and they do no take the time to talk with me or just smile me.

But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family and they dont have any problems because they just have to stay two more hour and they going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day ,and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home. Except for some students are different because they have to go to the school and they have to get up early ,and after school they have to go at work, that is difficult for some students, because they go in to the work after school like at 2:30 , and go out like at 12:00 am, and they dont sleep nothing the rest of the night, and they come tired to the school but they still come to the school, and they do the work that they have to do in the school, and the home too, so that is why that going to affect the students. I dont think that this new rule going to benefit the students, that rule just benefit the workers, because they going to have one more day left, and to more hours of work in the day, but for the students they get up early and go out of the school late ,and that is bad because, we dont going to have more time for work, just for study and do home work and sleep, that is all the things that we going to do, if the school adopted that rule the day for students are going to be gone for them.

85,3213,5077C09B20DC,"Its a wonderful day to spend outdoors and do something productive. Spending more time outdoors is better than being at home or being on your phone all day. Families can do different types of activities outdoors. Going to the state fair is something all families or friends can do that is fun. Another way of enjoying outdoors is going camping with your family. Spending more time with your family outdoors can be fun and productive. People can go hiking with other people. Hiking is an outdoor activity that you can walk. When your like stress you can walk and listen to the beautiful birds chirping. Like for an example, fishing, hiking, going to the beach, doing cookouts, and going to the park is an activity. Everybody would be occupied, and would have so much excitement in what they are doing. For an example, last summer I went to Pocohuntus State Park with my family. We went on a tour around the whole park. As we were walking, we had seen a building. We had entered the building, and inside it was a mini zoo. The mini zoo was filled with all different types of animal. There was animals that wasnt from Virginia, and brought it from another state. I would love to go back with my family this summer again. Going to the state fair has a lot of options for you to do. Like for an example it has games, and roller coasters and more variety of games to play. The state fair is a really fun place. For instance, I went to the state fair last year with my cousin. The state fair was full of people and enjoyment. Their was a lot of games, roller coasters, a mini farm, there was a concert, a lot of food courts, and horse racing. That day was a really productive day because we had to walk from station to station. I rode a roller coaster called the ""Dome"" it was really scary and it kept spinning upside down, sideways from left to right. This is a good outdoor activity to do with families or friends. Another way to enjoy outdoors is to go camping with your family. You can play games, do campfire, and make moores while you are in the outdoors. For example, when I was 8 years old I went camping with my family. I remember that day it was so cold. I slept in the back in the trunk with my cousins, and then I transferred to the passenger seat because it was so cold. The next morning everybody woke up and then after we took a walk around the lakes. Afterwards everybody packed their stuff and headed back home. All of these are examples of doing outdoors activity with your family . Spending time outdoors with your family like hiking, going to the state fair, and going camping is fun and everybody will enjoy their day. Everybody should at least do one of these activities outdoors, so you can feel relief from everything you have in mind. Having fun at these places would want you to go back again ",8,8,8,8,7,8,1056,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Most of the time we tend to think that because were adults we are doing the right thing, but instead were doing the opposite. Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before youre life falls apart. Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that theirs no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with youre life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what youre going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions. The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured youll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case its easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with youre life. After all maybe guidance isnt a good place to go. One of the reasons that people dont seek for guidance is that its too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, youre not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does. In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices. As we grow we deal with so many things and sometimes its good to always talk with an expert. After all were not perfect but the best decision for you is to seek guidance.

It has been said that to be yourself in a world that constantly try to make you someone else is the greatest thing yourself can do and accomplish. Personal thoughts and opinions agree with this statement and proof to be real with articles and autobiography of examples from successful people. First one of the reasons of being yourself is better than being controlled is to think in about someone who has already accomplish something. An example can be: Nicolas Tesla, Martin Lutherking, Neil Armstrong, and Albert Einstein. They all have done a something that changed everything, not only their life but everyones life. Being controlled by the government to go to school and do what they want will not help in life goals; to be successful the community have to achieve their goals to make a change. Furthermore being yourself will help in self confidence and will help in life accomplishments. For example, big man with an opportunity to work with a company much superior than his, has to go to a conference to talk about bussines, his self confidence isnt really well supported and he ruined the conference because of it. All successful people have something in common and its having self confidence. It will help you in real world challenges, and being what a person is everyday is the best thing to do. In the other hand, the community keep its way having trouble to live and following the governments ""help"". Only people with great disciplinary actions can success with this help and its why people keep following what they say to do. In Virginia there are a lot of public schools, they all teach the same thing and have the same exams. This is the same school 10 years ago and people have goals that cannot be accomplished because of school limitations. In conclusion, Reading at all the people who has accomplished something for them and for us the key to be successful is that community have to change its way to accomplish goals and to not only depend on schools that will not teach us how to life after school is finish.

It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes. Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world. Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it. Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow others behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end. Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams.

I really think that if we want to be success in life, we have to be positive on everything, a lot of famous people said that for example, Michael Jordan said: the key to the success is to be positive. We have to be positive on everything that we do if we have a negative attitude everything is going to be negative, maybe we are going to fail but that is another key to the success, that means we are doing everything well, but if we fail, we have to keep trying and never give up, until we get what we want, Michael Jordan said: I fail a lot of times but, that is the reason why I am who I am. There is going to be bad moments in the journey but that does not mean that we are done, we have to be positive and think positive, because for everything there is a solution. But another key to the success is to be humble, when we get what we wanted we have to remeber from where we come, be positive is important, but be humble is the most important thing. But the most important thing follow your dreams and never stop fighthing for them, until you get what you want. I am agree with this statment: It has been said that a positive atittude is the key to the success in life.",4,4,6,7,6,6,2405,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

However, having a good breakfast or even any good food to begin your day sometimes help the brain to work very well , and its also help make the brain be in a very good position of working during the day. and not only does it work for the brain, its also consist or contain some particular minerals like carbohydrate, protein, and fat and other supplementary substance that also help for human growth and also help give energy to the human body. lastly , changing the school food will also will make student that has never tried the school lunch will now want to try it . Moreover, some student order food and have it deliver to the school all because they do not like the school food or allergic to certain food , and if such incident keeps happening, the school food will go waste and its will make the school loose money. so therefore, i will end my speech by saying that its a very good and and a nice decision for having to change the school food to a healthier one .once again i hope you take time from your busy schedule and read this letter.

In other way, been with a good attitude can help us improve in life that helps us to learn, to concentrate and, to be a good thinking of someone else. Also, something kind of the same happened to me some time ago when my father was teaching me how to drive, and every time I did something wrong he yelled at me and one day I was with a really bad attitude because of that and than I realized that been mad was not going to help me so i changed my attitude and i learn to drive really fast. Been mad only makes us worst at doing that because we are not thinking about the positive thinks of that activity just at the negative thinks and thats what makes everything worst.

103,3231,B3F0F2F6487F,"should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week? people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyones brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both. Second, everyones brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school. Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school. In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyones brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.

104,3232,DA4E1BDBD778,"What Ralph Emerson say,sometimes it could be a challenge for some adult but it is more then a challenge for teenagers,because since you are a children you know how your life is going to be. If you grow up in a family who cares about you on what you do the whole day you know that you are lucky because not all people have the same family as you. When a teenager have a family who do not care about him he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail. When the person dont have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family. That is what be yourself mean care about you and your family and give to your little brothes the opportunities that you did not have. Most people take that decision when they are teenagers,that is the most hard decision to make because you are living all your past behind and trying to work hard and never go back to the same place. People who did take that decision when they where young they know how it feels be on that situation, they learn how to be themself and how a real man act.

105,3233,4ABC0ED00F91,"Do you believe that in order to success is going though failure contently? People think that going though failure can help you be successful though out time. Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure. First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful. Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right. This is why this saying is very important to understand. In conclusion, in order to succeed through failure can always be a good thing and it can help you to become better but most importantly to feel good about yourself and the success that you made.",7,8,6,7,8,7,977,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
106,3234,44DCCF637033,DEAR PRINCIPAL All the students should perform community service because the adults are out there working the whole day and when they come back home they want to drive on a clean community. The students when they do community service they are learning about their future life it is like a job you cant slack off. The adults dont have enough time to do community work with their job and all that but who has more free time than the students or kids . That is not all when we clean up our community our children our going to live in a clean community so help make a better future. The students may this is corny but they know too that they want their children to in a clean community and for their grandchildren. The community service could be any not just cleaning up also help tutor your neighbors child with home work and any thing out side your house helping is community service. You can babysit your neighbors kids and other peoples kids too that could count as community. The teachers could have like a game where who ever does the most community service gets like a prize of the class. There would be like when a student gets suspended they have do community work and give him or her an hour or more time .

107,3235,5AFBB5573AB3,"Have you ever just sat at home all day and used your phone? Oder food or play games and Facetime friends? being on technology doesnt help you make friends or help you get out of the house. Some people say its a negative effect on people because all they do is use their phone when they need something, instead of going out getting fresh air or hanging out with friends. People that are constantly on their phones can cause them depression, because all they do is sit at home, and the phone provides them everything. it can also draw you away from friends and can be a distraction at school It also can be a positive effect because you get to text your friends, for example example if a friend moved out of state you would still have contact with them. its also easier to do homework, or you can read a book online instead of going to the library and getting one. ""Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others"" in that quote it says that you can finish a task without having contacts with people, how is someone suppose to have social contacts with people? how do you learn new things or new meet people? Thats why technology can be bad for someone people. For example when Im on my phone all day cause im sick or stayed home from school I get bored being on my phone all day, yes the phone is useful but it doesnt help staying in your room all day watching a movie or a show, you dont get to learn anything. Talking to people and having social contact is sometimes better, you learn a new word or a new fact each day, but theres some negatives in all of it, you can lose close friends because you get distracted on your phone and you dont listen to what they have to say. Theres a lot to do beside staying at home and being on your phone, you can go out and get lunch with friends instead of sitting at home and eating alone. I know a few people that dont have many friends, so they are usually on their phones a lot, you can see the difference, people that are on their phone a lot and just sit at home dont really know how to act in public. People sometimes dont like going out and trying new things because they got used to being on their phones. In conclusion technology is a negative effect on people because it doesnt allow them to see whats outside of their phones. They tend to just use their phones when sometime its better if they talk to their friends in person. Using your phone can take you away from your friends and it isnt a good thing.

108,3236,E18675E47293,"Dear, School Board of Education I personally disagree with the idea of adding one and a half hours of school. This is a terrible Idea and here are some reasons why I disagree so please grab a seat, relax, and take your time to read this. The first reason why there shouldnt be extra school hours is students will have to walk in the dark. The second reason is students will have less time for sports and other after school activities and also less time for family and friends. And finally students will be sick of having school for a such a long period of time and possibly stop going to school. First of all not everyone is fortunate enough to have a ride to school but that doesent mean that they cant go to school so they walk, but if the school board adds more school time students who walk will have to walk in the dark. Walking in the dark could be very dangerous because you dont know whats in front nor whats behind you and that could cause students not to go to school anymore because they will be scared of walking in the dark and feel unsafe. Another example of why it could be dangerous to walk in the dark is if someone is trying to cross the street and a car doesent see them theyll probably get ran over and the school wont be responsible for the accident. Something that also is good to keep in mind is that if the school hours get changed and even if you try to avoid students from walking in the dark Theres a cost. Youll have to put street lights and that could be very expensive, and the money could be used for educational purposes. The second reason why extra school hours shouldnt be added is students wont have much time for sports or other after school activities. Sports and school are both important and they both should be equally balanced. So if school gets longer than maybe well have less time to see our family and friends. I remember when I did football practice was getting shorter and shorter because winter came, and during that time it was also raining a lot and snowing a lot so we missed a lot of games and practices, imagine if school was an hour and a half long, there wouldnt even be a football season at all. The last reason why an extra hour and a half of school is a bad idea is because, a lot of students would get really sick of school and stay home or try to get suspended so that they dont have to got to school. Weve all been in that situation where we dont want to go to school so we pretend were sick, even I get tired of having to go to school every day, in fact I dont really want to be here right now but I have to. Weve all tried to make our parents believe that were sick, but thats a really old trick and parents already know it, and make us go to school. If students get more school time they just wont stand it and theyll start skipping school. But dont worry I wont do that. In conclusion I think adding an extra hour and a half of school is a horrific idea, it will just cause more problems for the education system, students, parents, and even for our hard working teachers because they will have a more work and less time for themselves. But I also understand why you would want to add an extra hour of school.",8,8,8,8,8,9,3221,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework.

In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam.

111,3239,2EA9DA7AAD2C,"Thomas Jefferson said ""determine never to be idle."" What he means is that people should not just sit there and do nothing for their whole life because it wont help them accomplish their goals. Some people say doing something serves a purpose. Others say that inactivity also serves a purpose. Doing nothing at all is a bad choice. The best option to serve a purpose is to actually do something by helping others and the world then staying idle and not doing anything to help others. First, the reason why Thomas Jefferson said that people should never be idle is because he wants to change their lives forever. Another reason why people should take this advantage is that if people dont do any activities in their life, then they wont be able to achieve their goals in the future. Most people will say this, ""doing something serves a purpose because it could help other people get their work done."" Its good to start doing activities at a younger age because they will be able to experience it and get used to it later on. Also, doing activities can help them gain more respect and they could get famous. It could be too late to start doing activities when they are older, but people just have to think of what they are going to do to fix it. Next, most people will say that they dont know what activity they should do. For example, i didnt want to do any activites like other people did so i went and did karate for 4 years. A year later I started to swim every Saturday and eventually I have been getting better. After that I started to go to the gym from Monday through Thursday every single week. Its not too late to start an activity at a younger age, but for an older age it could be. The people just got to work hard if they want to achieve their goal, but the only way they could do it is if they can believe that they can do this. In addition, other people think that not doing any activity serves a purpose. They say that because they think their parents do most of the work so they dont have to do any of it. Also, there are people who are just lazy and dont care about their life. Others think that doing activities doesnt really achieve their goal in the future. Most people just dont know what they want to do in life. Lastly, Thomas Jefferson doesnt want people to be idle for their whole life because he wants to help them do activities that they think its interesting. Another reason why people should take an advantage of this, so when they are young, they will understand of what is gonna happen in their future, and then as they get older, they will have full potential by doing it. Also, it will help them and other people get the job done. They will not have to struggle in their future. The thing about activities is to never give up, even if they mess up its ok, they just need to practice and practice nonstop.",8,6,7,6,7,7,616,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

114,3242,DB6B9E64CFF0,"All around the world involves people learning something new. We learn about different creatures, peoples ,and objects. An Individual that is willing to learn more each and everyday will succeed in life. Some people believe that Emerson statement ""unless someone try to do something beyond what theyve have already mastered will grow"", but I disagree. I believe people who try to do something beyond what theyve have already mastered, they will never grow because due to lack of experience, and not enough knowledge. To begin with, every individual want to become something in life. Theres literally a certain career that every individual is discovering for. People who wants to learn, participate in certain activities or classes would most likely get the dream career as they wish. Putting the effort is the answer to everyone problems. For instance, my friend Generic_Name shes a server at a restaurant. She is nineteen years old. Generic_Name has been working there since she was 17 years old already. Therefore, Generic_Name knows all of the meals that are served, places that need to be restocked etc. Unfortunately, she getting tired of the job. For some reason, she doesnt want to try something new. Having only one job experience is barely enough for the person to know about different experiences from other jobs. I strongly believe,as if Generic_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job. She will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Clearly, getting involved into different jobs will even give you different alternatives. Pursuing this further, knowledge is very important when it comes to trying something new. Individuals need to know atleast some knowledge when trying to reach further into their career For example, my eighth grade teacher Generic_Name would sometimes sit with me at lunch. We would discuss about anything. One day, I brought up about going into high school. Since my middle schools years were coming to an end. I asked her if their were any advice for my upcoming freshman year. She told me high school it will get harder . Also, I needed to become more serious about my education. Mostly likely I will have to pass all exams, sols ,and keep my GPA high. These are the years I will0 start thinking about what I want to do with my career. She gave me advice to guide me through to become better. I strongly oppose, knowing more knowledge about something will make yourself grow. Obviously, if an individual is trying to do something beyond then what theyve already mastered, they will never grow. Just by having lack of experience will lead the individual feeling in their comfort zone. Also, the lack of knowledge will leave the person clueless. Some people may argue that unless the person try to do something beyond what they have mastered, they will grow. How can someone grow from repeating on doing what they do on a normal basis? How can they learn something new with such little knowledge? For example, my dad came to United States when he was 14 years old. He knew little English. Also, he knew how to write some words, but that was all that he knew. He put his full time effort to learn a new language. Each step he took he accomplished. He himself grew out of the stage of not knowing something. He went beyond into what he really wanted. Finally, everyone needs experience and knowledge in order to grow. Imagine doing a science project on an unknown animal. Surprisingly this creature changes colors, sizes, and shape. Wouldnt you want to invest in the creature more? Learn how the creature lives?

Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got a easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier. In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in peoples live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school. Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do. However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

118,3246,6AB2B78CE0AF,"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on peoples lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news. Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents dont get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because its on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesnt loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you dont know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language. Some people lives in another country or states and its hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You cant write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they cant meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at. Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks its fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology. Most people like that technology is growing because its better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABCs and 123s. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better. Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . Theres many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of peoples live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also its a good way to communicate with other people faster. ",6,7,8,8,7,7,1386,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
119,3247,0BB9FAE6E27B,"Setting A Good Example Have you thought of set an example for your own behavior? Albert Schweitzer said ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people. However; others believe that their are better ways to influence others because the person being influenced should set their own examples not everyone wants to follow someone examples. Although not everyone thinks the same its better to set an example by your own behavior to influence others. People get influenced by demonstrations, peoples mistakes and when visualizing things. To influence someone you have to set an example for them to visualize what you are trying to influence them to do. Most people get influence when presented demonstrations through videos, presentations and pictures. My favorite youtubers influence me by spreading postivity through their videos and content. They help the homeless by providing them shelter; they make peoples day by helping them with their needs. They influence me to want to help the homeless and other people. These youtubers Influence their subscribers to spread posivity throughout the world by the examples they set on their videos. A lot of people learn from others mistakes; setting a good example from your own behavior will influence others not to do your mistake in your example because they will take it into concerdation. One of my friends told me their experience on missing their opportunity of taking a course required for graduation. She did not get to graduate on time she stayed one more year in high school to complete the course she missed. She regretted not taking the course her junior year to graduate on time. My friend influenced me to take the class my junior year and to learn from her mistakes. I didnt miss my opportunity I got to take the course and earned the credit for it. I learned from her example she influenced me by telling me to follow her example to accomplish it. Most people dont believe things until they see an example of things. Theyre are people that need to visualize things to get influenced by them. Its confirmed that most influencers present things that you can visualize to influence people. I am a person that needs to see an example of something in order to believe it. When I am searching information I need to see if it is fiction or non fiction. Once I researched up the wrong information for a presentation the article didnt state a true event. I got a bad grade for the presentation as my consequence I had an F that quarter for not stating a true fact. Influencers set examples of their own behavior to influence you the right way. Others believe that there are better ways to influence others by letting the person being influenced set their own example. The person being influenced can not set their own examples if they dont have experience. People need to follow someone example because they need to be influenced before they can influence others by setting their own examples. All influencers have been influenced by others examples they didnt set their own example. Following an influencers example will help the person being influenced learn from their mistakes and improve from them to set better examples to others being influenced. Albert schweitzer set his own examples from his own behavior to influence others. He was Inspired by other influencers examples and that it was the only thing to help influence others. He says that the best way to influence other people is to set a good example by your own behavior. You should follow someone examples by their own behavior to set a good example to influence others.

Failure leads to many different directions,But, if we learn our mistakes we can understand what we did wrong. People sometimes have the enthusiasm or optional energy to get thought the obstacles. Some-others dont which its acceptable for this type of situation. Giving up faith is likely, giving up on yourself as an individual. Tools are like megalo, it helps us become the person we are today. Tools guide us to consist of good devolpement of character. It can read our thoughts and mind as a reader, when you specifically need them in hand.

You may never know that the tools you were looking for has been sitting their waiting to be taken. You knew it was the item you were searching for, soon enough it was a success. Without failures or mistakes, we wont even understood what errors we had. Life wouldve become a lot harder, stressed, overwhelmed etc. The more mistakes we resolved, more issues fills up. We wont even be able to undo our issues. It would waste more of youre time. I would argue with this fact, success comes from mistakes and obstacles along the path.

But some other students chose to take those courses and graduate in three years and take some classes in the summer. It up to them to chose if they want to go to college or go straight into the work and start making money to help themselves. but I suggest graduating high school in four years is a good idea because students want to spend some time with their families before going into college if they chose or go straight into the working force. So it is not a good idea to graduate high school in three years and take summer or evening classes because it can be too much for you if you work in the summer because you will always be going back and forth from school to work and you will not have time to be with your family and go on vacations with them. So graduating high school in three years is a bad idea because it will take up all your free time in the summer and you wont be able spend time with family and friends and you wont be able to do all the things you wanted to do after you graduate high school in three years because of all the summer classes and you have to take when you graduate high school in three years. Because when you graduate high school in four years you have all the time in the world if you dont go to college but when you have a job you can take some time of to spend some time with your family and friends.

Attitude is a behavior that people has inside of them, and is impossible to see it, but by action you can tell. A person may born without attitude, but parents are one reason to teach their children to have an excellent attitude. A positive attitude is the key to success in life, because it assist to live with different people in world, and gives other a desire to impress someone who have a positive attitude. First, a positive attitude is the key in life because, people loves someone who is kind and helpful. Having a better attitude in front of community make people feel pride. For example, school there is different people from different countries, and they have their own behavior. some student doesnt like to talk to other, and It gives them a hard time to learn new things in life. Without thinking attitude prove what kind of person he or she is. Secondly, a positive attitude is the key to success in life, because it may entice people to see other are important, and being able to help each other. For instance, doctors they have an opportunity to keep a person alive. They do all of that because of their adorable attitude; and care a lot about another peoples life. Small thing can make a difference in the world. Nevertheless, some people say a positive attitude is not the key to success in life. They argue that thus born with positive attitude, but they start to change themselves later. The point has merit, because not all people has positive attitude success in life, some of them are struggle. However, positive attitude benefits people to receive a lot of knowledge, and become more successful. Therefore, positive attitude can give a person chances, to make connection with different people. To conclude, positive attitude carry the mean of being a human. Because you cant say youre a good person with negative attitude. Its necessary to have a quality attitude, that may persuade other to change theirs. Lastly, a guest person who have positive attitude can live anywhere he or she goes. The lesson, if you see your attitude people are not happy with try to modifying it. ",7,7,7,6,6,6,3320,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance. In conclusion, distance learning and its method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",6,4,7,6,6,5,3436,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Has the limitation of human concact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives? Towards to technology, lack of communication is going to ruin our human sociaty. Especially when phones are advancing in the next years. One day, technology will take over the human population. Say this, one day a boy meets this girl from school and they were talking through a social media, but one day, they thought to meet up in person and when they saw each other, it was really awkward at first, but then they became very good friends. So they started to go to the movies, the mall, restuarants, and etc. They started as two random strangers to having a, boyfriend and girlfriend relationship. Saying this to someone is really touching, because liking someone is to die for, but theres rules to follow and things to do and not just kissing or making love, its being there for them and hopefully youll be there too. Meeting that special person is a blessing, because for so long people have been trying to talk to this special someone, but its really hard to confess it through person, but throught a screen is pretty easy, but do you really mean it? Saying ""I love you"" means alot to someone, but actually saying it over and over again, it just warms my heart to say this, but i think im in love. Not just saying to make people to break through a screen, because saying ""i wanna break up"" it really just says you do not have the heart to say it to their face.

I think u should ask for more help and advice. so you can pick the better choices. You can get more info on the topic you are doing. Like for one person can tell you one thing and a other person can tell you something else. Thats how you can get some more info. It helps more by asking more people because while you have your info they have there info as will. So then you can have more knoallige about whatever you doing. Last of all its better to ask more people because like I said you can get more knoallige on the topic and will help you one making the better choices as will. Its all ways good to get more info on your topic because you dont ever want to do something with out any knoallige. People can help you answer stuff faster. you can probably can get the answer faster by telling more then one person. like for example you are doing some hard work at school and you want the right answer you are not just going to ask one person you are probably going to ask more then one person. All really because everybody thinks different. And last of all ask more then one person can probably get you the right answer. you should other people for help. you can help you pick the right choices.

138,3266,FA0A1D6FEE25,"I agree with Ralph Waldos quote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you somthing else is the greatest accmplishment. In todays society everyone wants to be part of the wave to whatever is popular. People always go the extra mile to impress other people even if they have to change their style or the way they act. Its hard to be yourself in todays society so those who can do it have accmplished something great. Being yourself is better because then youll find your real friends. Students in Middle School and High School for whatever reason want to be cool. They think doing drugs, breaking rules and being disrespectful to others is cool. When they get home theyre a different person. Theyre respectful, follow all the rules and dont do drugs because thats the way they are raised, Theyre being themselves. That shows the impact of what people consider being cool is. Some students are at the wrong spot at the wrong time and start hanging out with the wrong group of people to be cool. This is important because they could be offered drugs or be offered to skip class. The students would say yes because they want to be cool knowing very well never to do it. This shows what could happen to a student who are trying to be cool. when they know to stay in school and never do drugs because that wont help your education it would only slow it down. For example one of my friends was skipping school and doing lots of things he wasnt supposed to be doing. He thought he was cool and told everyone. I guess you could say he got cool from it but in the long run he suffered. This is important because while him trying to be cool he ended up getting bad grades and getting kicked out of school. The school gave him one more chance and made him go to the carrer center where students who fail usually go. This shows what could happen when you try to be cool. Being yourself is the best thing you can accomplish because you wouldnt worry about most things other students wear or say. You would go further in life being yourself and becoming something you want to become. If your dont want to become a doctor and want to be a car machanic then that what you do.

In this essay I want to answer a question ""What are the effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classrooms?"". When cellphones were allow to use in the classroom at first there was a lot of benefits for example: it became easier for teachers and students to do their work, for students it became more easier to find information about a topic by using their cellphones instead of using a computer because sometimes there is not enough computers for every student, for teacher by allowing students to use cellphones in the classroom the teachers they could find better ways to do a class work by using a app that it might not be possible to use in a computer, but obviously nothing can be that perfect by allowing students to use their cellphone in the classroom there was a downside many students started to irresponsibly using their cellphones in the classroom.

141,3269,ABEA8B5724EF,"The World We Live in More than 4 billion people with different culture,different background and different mentality live in our planet Earth; and each person have their own way of life style. Naturally, we have to associate our self with others, to manage our way of living. It means life push us to open our doors and see different people quality and life style. Emersons statement "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" In my opinion, this is wrong. Sometimes, we have to allow our self and live other people lives. It means we have to change our face mask everyday to be a head of somebody. this will help us to avoid conflicts, to accomplish our personal goals and to live in any environment. Sometimes, I fell like we should change the name "" world "" to "" different."" It explain the meaning a lot more. our world is different. every living matter have their own characters and identity. Birds can fly but lions cant. Plants, they cant move but we can. This can show us how our world is divided in many ways. This is leading us to conflicts and fights in every aspects. For example, we can see a political conflict between Donald Tranp and the Democrat. Personally I don,t agree with Donald Tranps ideas and terms. But if my community agrees and supports Tranps ideas, It is mush easier if I put a new a mask in my face and put a fake smile on top of it and pertained that i am on same track like them witch is supporting Donald Tranp. It will help to avoid conflicts between me and my community. Every strong person uses methods to accomplish their drams and goals. focusing is one of the beast way a person use it to be on the top of everybody. strong person fight to win and to be number one no matter what the situation is. Giving up is the beget enemy in their life. Not being somebody else cannot be the reason to give up in a dream. For example, If your goal is to be number one fighter, you have to fight first. Even if you have a lover personality. If you want to be a fighter you have to fight. thats the reality. You cant love some one and punch them in the face at the time. you have to switch up to get to your dreams ( to being number one fighter). American secrete service agents go to Afghanistan to catch terrorist. They are not Muslims but they have to dress up like Muslim and learn their language and culture just to make their country safe from terrorist. Being somebody else help them to achieve there goals. I believe, becoming somebody else, can help you to learn about that someone personality. This can help you to adapt the behavior of that person, witch can help you to establish a good relationship. For example, I am originally from Ethiopia living in the US. Sometimes I have to act like American just to establish a good environment around me. Thanksgiving is a well know holly day in American culture . But we dont celebrate it in Ethiopia. Just to respect for my community, i celebrate thanks giving with fake smile with others just to create a good environment in my area. In my conclusion , sometimes we should be somebody else to live in our divided society. This can also solve our conflicts , helps us to accomplish our goals and to be live in any environment. I believe we have to be logic and see the other side. This could be the smartest way to live our life with our crazy the society .

We were dependent but work include be prepare to have new experiences in our personal life and we are prepare to the future. The third thing is Life Cycle when we are baby, kids, teenagers, adults and older. The first is School (experiences) In our life school is important because teachers educate we and we learn of them about the classes like english when we travel to any country that speak this language we need to learn by process every day inside and outside the class because we improve with new topics like verbs, punctuation marks in school porcess. Teachers teach good values in our life like integrity, respectful, honest, responsible, service. For example, when we start to study we dont know how to write, read, paint, speak. They teach we everything like our parents at home. We decide when we grow up if we want graduate from the school,those values efforts, dedication, knowledge, good skills and new opportunities if we do everything correct inside and outside the school because we cant stop growing the opportunites that we can have is only one time in the life. Education is very important now in the present because if we go to school we are professionals and we can have good choices. Second is Work being independent in the life our parents work all the time because they want that we can have a good life, but when we go to work is interesting for example when we continue going to the school our parents cant give money all the time and we think like adults being independent, finding a job and learn about the life not is simple and is hard at the same time. Our future dependent if we want to think like adults or teenagers. We can be master helping other people that need our help those people will grateful with we because if we try to help each other we know everything from life experiences, when we go to school they pay better with a diploma from High School, College or University. Finally is Life Cycle when we are babies our parents teach we every process for example how to go to the restroom, brush our tooth, take a shower, speak, walk, eat for example when is the time for go to the dinning room. The time when we need go to sleep is relly important learn every little thing that our parents teach we when we are baby. We discovere a new stair that already we can be mastered. Kids for example after when we were baby in a simple thing we discovered new things, but being kids we continue in a easy way the life like speak, walk, eat, sleep, change our clothe not is difficult because we learn in the past, we try to do something beyond that we dont know before. Teenagers when we think that the life is hard going to the school, work, family, not is easy because is more responsability, efforts being stronger and continue doing those things is very different from the past. Adults is more difficult when we were baby, kids and teenagers because adults are charge of the family, work, pay, education, responsabilitys in the job and home. Adults are dependent because they learn the good things from the past for example when teenager want permission for go to any party adults really need to know what person is, where is from, the personality and who is her/his family, in any moment like that is really difficult to say yes or no. Adults are important in the society because they are master and grow from the Life Cycle. Older like grandmother and father they already know that grow not is easy but they did every step in a good form going the school, work - independent. Old people in sometimes need help from younger people like the family can be sister, brother, son, wife and daughter because they are tired and need space to relax like going to the park sharing with his/her family and friends. In this last thing if we try something different we can have a positive life. In conclusion: We can try being a better person in our life because every step is very important maybe in sometimes life is hard but if we learn in a correctly form everything like going to the school is a new experience, work - independent teach we being stronger and not be afraid, life cycle is the process from every step when we were baby, kids, teenagers, adultd and older. We grow every moment that can be easy or difficult. We need to be dependent to grow up, master everything helping other people in the world. I agree with the author because I know if we stop growing is very impossible to have new experiences in our life. Unless we try to do something different and intersting in our life we can a better chance to do good things can be in the present or in the future, for the new generation that can have good opportunities in school, job and with the society.

I agree with people who make their own decisions because it will build up confidence,higher chance of accomplishments, and it helps them understand from their mistakes. My first reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, it will build up confidence. Having confidence is a big thing to many people because thay can do many thing in life and will not fail. Having confidence can help people in many places. For example,If you are going to a job interview you will have to have a high confidence in you ,In order to get the job. Making your own decisions will help you build up more confidence. My second reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, you will have higher chance of accomplishments. If you make your own decisions you can have many accomplishments,because if you make good decisions in life you have more chance of success. You can accomplish anything you want if you make your own decisions,because making your own decisions can be anything you want and you dont have to follow anyone. My third reason why I agree with people who make thier own decisions in life is because, It will help people understand from their mistakes. People who make mistakes from thier own decisions will have a higher chance to understand and will not do it again. On the other hand,Many people seek guidnace from experts so they dont have to make thier own decisions;However,making your own decisions will help you be a better person and it will help you be you. In conclusion,Making your own decisions in life is a good thing for many of us. Making your own decisions will make you a better person and you dont have to follow others. Many people could seek guidance from experts If they cant make thier own decision. These are all of my reasons why I think people should make their own decisions.",8,7,7,7,8,8,3551,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

150,3278,C77A361A7476,"Is it good for students to to finish high school early?. Students should be allowed to take classes early because they do all their work in time , they take classes over the summer or even after school. They also get to go to college faster. They also get to walk and get there diploma faster. The student gets to go to college to study for what he wanted to study for. The students who study harder or finish the work they do should be allowed to finish school in three years. If they study hard and take extra classes let them fish early. Thats all up to them , if they care about their study let them walk early. The student puts his or her mind set to finish school early witch is great for them. The student who finishes school gets more time off of school. But at the same time more stress on them. At the end of the day the more students that finish school early have one full year of no school. They get to focus on what they wanna go to college for to study. But thats only some schools, some schools dont even allow students to finish school in three years. In some schools they make you do the full 4 years of high school. Some schools probley want the students to do the the full 4 years of high school because they probley need a class on 12th grade. If some schools let some students finish in the 3 years then the school wont be as packed. The schools need more space cause of more students coming in. They need to have more space and it would be less work for them. But at the same time it would take some time off the teachers. Some teachers have the time to help students and some dont. Welp thats all have to say about schools letting students finish school in three years. I really think schools should let students finish early because they work hard to get there. If the student finishes his or her work they should be allowed to walk early. I think that all schools should allow all the students who want to finish early to let them. Its good for the student that means he or her is educated and can get a good job and go to college to study for something really good.

If the kids are having a hard time on doing work at home or not understanding, they dont have to get worried about there grades dropping because there are other options that you can do. If the younger kids parents do not have that much time to sit and help them with work, then they can just get help from the learning program that happens at there school. The more you go to the meetings the better you will get even if it takes time. I also feel that this could be important to the older kids that help as well. This program would do very good for their service hours for there service hours for school. It must be a good feeling for them because they were chosen to do something they are good and smart at.

A, (B) or higher is a good grade so that way they can play a sport they like. Teachers would probably accept this policy so that way their students will pay more attention. This change would not effect much but for students who dont study this idea might not be good, and might fill bad because they love sports but cant play them for having to not pay attention or do your work at home.

158,3286,F1620489BEB3,"I agree that changing the school lunch menu to a healthier option would be a better solution. This could help resolve some problem we have today. The top problem in the world for this topic is that many people in America are obese and numbers are growing. This also helps show a new generation the many healthier option to choose from. What i think the best thing is the amazing new foods and cultures it can be introduce to you. How many people do you know that their or your kids dont eat the school lunch cause of the food almost everyday? In America we have gone through many tough times but a big issue that started happening in the late 90s and early 2000s was the growth in obesed. The line for what was good and bad for you was smudged and the only thing that was okay was that it tasted good. Thats why schools started noticing a change in peoples decisions for healthy or unhealthy choices. And change if not only a small bit to try and help, but that didnt mean they couldnt bring in their own food. Having a more healthier option would be good for students bodies and a better state of mind cause you know your giving your body energy and what it needs. We go through life living the way we were raise. That also comes with the food that was given to us as teenagers and kids. All of us have at least one trait that your care giver did that now you inherited, some people drink coffee more then other cause that how they saw life as. Which is why showing kids and teenagers a better more healthier life style early show them better eating options and that all starts with what to eat for lunch at school cause your there for almost half the day. The best part about eating a healthier life style is that you can try new and better options instead of the same lazy food. Almost every country use natural fresh produce in everything they eat cause of their culture. And showing people that might not like that idea, a food they wouldnt eat but end up loving it is the best feeling. This is also educational cause it introduces students to new culture are the world. This shows how they eat and prepare food in their country and the difference in our own lives. Its really eye opening for some people and it show kids not everything that doesnt look good is bad food. Having a healthier option for school lunch is good but it take a lot of meal prep and its more expensive them getting can or frozen goods. Employees that work in the lunch room are gonna have to come in more early to wash and cut fresh fruits and vegetables which means the school is gonna have to pay them more money cause their doing more. And to get the best quality produce, schools are gonna have to pay more money which some schools cant do. But the only thing that should matter is the students not this or that. The problem with schools is that their lowering down their standards with food to get things that arent necessary. They could be using that money for better food and better silver wear items then what we have now. Having school lunches be healthier is better for everyone even if it needs time to get use to. A better lunch can show people different and more unique foods around the globe also helps shows that not everyones different. This also helps show people that there are better options in fresh and natural items rather then foods that have yellow dye-7.

In my belief this is a good way to help kids not just with there homework but kids will improve on uderstading skills. they will learn how to learn things in a different way if they do not understand. Student will pass more tests and have better chances of getting to college and take this world in a good direction.

Kids are bright and smart they have fresh minds and they can hold things in there minds. If kids can have the 100% help they will just be absolutely geniuses they will be better than the person that thought them. If kids can have academic growth 10% a year with out help imagine what they could do if they had a homework club where like I said where they can be talented. when I was in 5th grade, I was kid that loved math but I was not very good at it. So my teacher suggested for me to join the homework club after school. At first I was not happy about it but then once I started to go I loved it because I understood math even better I kept geting in the upper 90 with test scores ,I had the most lessons done on a math program that is called Think trough math. I became a student helper at the homework club and I am now a smart intelligent math student. when I get to high school I will volunteer at the homework clubs at and go help kids for my own good and because I love to help people. These are all the reasons why I believe that having an after school homework club is important to students improvements. I will continue to volunteer in helping kids academically . Like we all know youth is the future of this world. I truly believe there are so many kids out there in the world that need help and they are smart but they can not get it because there is no one that pays attention to it.

160,3288,DD265EC28AEB,"Now a days schools are finding new ways to use cell phones for educational purposes. Schools and teachers want to find new ways to educate students through cell phones since every child is attracted to them. But with schools trying to find ways that works, it does have its negative effects to it. The effects with using cell phones in classroom for educational purposes is that many students will end up getting off tasks, no more hands on learning, and they will start to relying too much on their cell phones. With cell phones being use for educational purpose, it has its negative effects to it and will affect students learning in the process. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will not focus or get off task in their classes. If they use cell phones in classroom for a method to educate people, students with tend to get distracted on their phones and not learn what they are suppose to teach. Students will also end up dozing off and start to listen to music or even end up playing games on their phones and not focus on whats being taught. Also with social media being so big now a days students will focus more on texting friends or being on their Snapchat, Instagram, or even Twitter rather than focusing on what teacher is showing the classroom. With cell phones being use in classroom, students will end up getting more distracted and off task than when you do not use cell phones in the classroom to teach. The next paragraph will talk about another reason why using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes has its negative effect. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that there is no more hands on learning for students. If school are using cell phones as a method to teach people, the students are not getting the hands on learning that they should get. Back then before everyone had a cell phone the way they were taught was with the step by step on doing the work and trying to understand how you ended up doing the work. But if they use cell phones in the classrooms the students would not be getting the step by step understanding of the work, rather than they doing it on the phones and just getting the answers. With schools using phones in the classroom the students would not be getting the same knowledge and understanding to specific problems and work than those who learn the step by step learning to the problems. In the next paragraph we will see another reason why using cell phones for educational purposes has a negative effect in the classrooms. As cell phones are being use for educational purposes, a negative effect to this idea is that students will end up relying too much on their cell phones and technology to get the work done. As the more classroom or schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes the students will end up relying on their phone to get the work done for them and not try to do it theresleves. For example imagine students cell phones end up not working and they only used their cell phones to get the work done, what are they going to do now if they only use their phone to do the work and they did not learn the material on their own. With schools using phones as a way of teaching it with effect the students ways of learning and will start to rely on his/her phone in the later future to get their stuff done. In the last paragraph it will concluded the paper and sum up everything about the paper. In conclusion if more and more schools end up using cell phones for educational purposes they will make more students get distracted during class, not have the hands on learning they should have, and also they will start to rely on their cell phones more for the work rather than them trying to do the work them self. With cell phones trying to be used as a method of learning, it will end up not giving the students the education they need but rather them showing a way to get the work done quicker without all the extra work that should be done. So schools should stick with the methods they have now and not try to add cell phones as another method of teaching these students.

161,3289,E792CBEB06C5,"I think that students should bring phones to school but turn then off and put them in their locker. If the students dont do that job they might be in a big problem. in SCHOOL_NAME if the students do not turn theirs phone off and it rings during class the teachers automatically will take the phone from the students. Eventually the parents have to come and get the phone from school and give them to their kids. If the students bring their phones to school they will text their friends, call their friends and take pictures. In contrast if the students are doing those jobs during classes and there were no school rules the students would play with their phone during class time. During class time students might listen to their favorite songs on their phone and dont pay attention to the teacher which they will get a worst citizenship in their report card and they will not graduate and they will feel sad and shocked about what they have done to hurt them. lastly these are the reasons that students allow and not bring their phones to school,",7,6,6,5,6,6,3346,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
162,3290,57ED5BC70E40,"Dear Generic_Name I believe that working in a group is way better than working by yourself, get to do less work than working alone . Working with a group is more beneficial than working alone because when your working alone and you need help theres no one to help you,but when your in a group you get all the help you need. When i work by myself i usually dont get my work completed. Sometimes i be wondering what are we supposed to be doing. However working by yourself in cress your chances of staying focused and productive. Although you got a better chances of getting a good grade when you work in a group. It all depends on the group if they like to work with each other. Also you could easily get distracted by your own group mates ,but the all depends on the group and the communication they have with each others. My final reason is that working in a group is better than working alone you get your work done faster than you usually would have alone. There for working in a group has more beneficial like make new friends and new people. ",7,7,6,6,6,7,1134,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
163,3291,8A6FEEA6C0D3,"I think what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is true, because when all the people do their own self and become their own self. the chance for those people to become something else in this world is really high. They accomplishment to do greatest things in the world. Many people in this world believe that becoming thier own self is better for them, because people would not have to deal with the negative minds that other people have, because by the way all the people have different minds and some people can have possitive minds but there is lot of people that have negative minds. People that decided they wanna become something else in this world with other people it would be really hard for them to become some else this world. The reason why it would be really hard for them is because they would have to deal with possive minds and negative minds. But the people that decided that they wanna because accomplish in be better in this world. Those people are the ones that decided to become their own, because they wont have to deal with no neggative minds they would just do what their head tells them to do without hearing negative minds and they just keep gone keep doing what they think would be the best for them. People that decided that they wanna become their own, is for a reason they decided to do that becauuse they wanna become better people in the world, they wanna give their families a better life style, but the main thing is. They wanna be an example for their kids, they wanna show their kids that no matter what if they keep their head up and keep and possitive minds. They would be able to accomplish anything in life, but they would show their kids that become their own thins, it is not just become their own things, all that have work and dicipline, but the main thing is always keep their minds possitve. people that become their own after they make a family they would start showing thei kids to become their own since a young age. they would show their kids the work and decipline it takes to become their own self. When lot of people dont think the same way but each people have their minds set. I think at this point in life and in the whole world. The people that should start thiking about if they wanna become their own is. All the people that is about to graduated High School. the people that is at the age of 17 and 18 years should be ones that start thinking about that. because all those people about to get until the real world and they gone see what real is, in the real world. people never know the obstacles that life can put on you as soon as you get in the real world. Life would might put you hella obstacles just for you to realize and see what you doing, so those kids that are about to graduated high school they need to do their best so they can go throught all the obstacles that life would put on them in the journey for them to make it all the way to the up to their dreams. All this it comes to the people that they wanna become their self. They would have to keep mind possive and think it would not be easy at all, but doing hard work and always looking forward they would be able to do it. Everyone is this world can accomplish the greater things in this world and be better. All those people need is motivation and have their mind possitive to make it all the way up to their dreams. All hard work have pay off at the end, people would realize that all the hard work they did was something better life and when they look back at all the hard work they did. They would of their own self, they would be like all this n all the obstacles i had to go throught was for some better in my life and for a huge chance in me now i can said all the work i been done, it is finally acomplished.",7,6,7,8,7,6,1836,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
164,3292,FE8B7167BD93,"Working in a group is better People in this days are deciding rater to work in a group or work alone. There is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. Most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. Here are some of the reason why I think that working in group in better than working alone. Some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with. The first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. For example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. Probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. Then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. With the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. With more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test. Another reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. For example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. I think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. In a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. Everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. Also they can be the best project on the class. The last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. For example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. Maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. Meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. Sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. Some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves. In conclusion working in groups is a good choice because it has good benefits. You can get more time for yourself by finishing faster with the help of your group members. You have lest information to look for because there are other members that are looking for other information. Finally you can meet new people and became a friend of them. There are some other benefits that help to work in a group and understand more about a topic with the halp of all the members.",8,6,7,8,5,8,3876,"conventions 8, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
165,3293,D684AE8A9418,"Many people are going say that we can be our self, but even though we can be as we want in certain things, our character is formed by influences beyond our control because we tend to try to fit in society, we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire. As humans we tend to try to fit in society; we like to feel liked by the people around us, so we act different than we actually are. The feeling of being liked by society in most cases makes us feel pride and self confidence, which is fine but makes a line between being our self and being influenced. Fitting in a society might be hard for some people,even frustrating, but people still are willing to do it so we can not be seen as different. trying to fit in a society might be the biggest reason why we do not act as we want and tend to act as everyone else in front of other people,because we fear that if society categorize us different then society is going to dislike us,however, there is some people that are careless of what people say about them. There is always someone that will not care at all of what people say about them which is good,but, there is always a time where they cared or will care about it. It is part of being a human that we care about what society says because we do not want be seen as someone different that can not fit. For example, students in schools dress as the trend is, so they can fit in society,even when they grow they will care how they look. The fear of making mistakes influences part of our character. We fear that making mistakes will make us imperfect or not good at something, therefore, we think that if we are not perfect we are a failure,the fear of making mistakes is what makes us human, and that is a gigantic influence to us and we can not control it but makes people stronger and, help us to develop a character that will represent us in the future. we fear many different things in life for example,our appearance, if we think our appearance is not as we want, we get insecure in many different ways but, it is a huge help in the development of our own character because we learn from those mistakes. Being insecure is a huge obstacle and mistake for people to get to choose their own character, because it does not let us decide for what we really want,therefore people should learn from them which it will hopefully help people to develop a better character. Many people find themselves as insecure because of the fact that people might dislike them. Scientist have said that having the fear of making mistakes will make it harder for people to achieve their most wanted goals in life. We all as humans make mistakes, therefore we can not or it is harder for us to find our own character by our own self. As humans we all have at least someone that we admire a lot,and we see them as a person we should imitate so we can be even a bit as them. Imitating someone in any way will make our self to struggle when trying to develop our own character because we are thinking of how someone else would think. Imitating someone else that has had such a great impact in life might be good for your self and you might achieve your goal because that person did. Even though our character is formed by influences of other we admire we also have to have our own character into it, so we can feel the pride of achieving a goal that has had our effort in to it. Having a bit of your own character into what you do is important too because it is not a full imitation of what someone else did. Many famous es have said that they also had followed someone elses steps to get where they are, so being influenced by the people you admire might help the people a lot to achieve their goals as it did with the famous people,and they also said that the people they admired a lot was the one helped them to find themselves, because if it was not for them they would have probably the same as they were before being famous. In conclusion, we can decide how we want to be but that does not remove the fact that our character is mostly formed of influences that we can not control because we tend to try to fit in society,we fear making mistakes, and we try to be like someone we admire a lot. People are going to find themselves mostly from experiences and influences that they can not control,however you should have some of your own character to do things so when you achieve something important you feel better about yourself, but we,the people tend to act different so people like us and it is something inevitable,either control in life. As humans we dont like to be categorized as different and our main goal in a big percentage of people in the world is to fit in society and that is something that can not be controlled, but it helps us a lot to find our self afterwards and form our character at the end.",8,9,9,10,8,9,2992,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 10, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
166,3294,A93471B62AF5,"Hi, my name is Generic_Name. I heard that you are accepting people to come look at some businesses they prefer, and learn more about what they are interested in. One thing Im interested in knowing is, How many people do you let come and experience this opportunity ? I strongly feel like it would be a pleasure to be able to come and see the environment or being able to understand the right and wrong ways of teaching kids. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible. I feel like being a well rounded person is a good character trait everyone should have. I could demonstrate that in many ways. You are probably thinking, ""Generic_Name, everyone can be a well rounded person in their own ways"". Thing is, people cant compare themselves to me. I have qualities that others may lack in, such as: speaking 2 languages, understanding kids, and being about to tolerate the kids. Speaking 2 languages is great. For example, if I have a Spanish student in my class, Id be able to have a conversation with him and make him/her feel comfortable. Also, showing that you are interest in the job and showing that you want is good to show. You want to be able to show people that you are qualified for it. Respect is another thing I will always have with me. I will show the kind of respect to my parents, to anyone else out there, whether is be my boss, coworkers, students, or their parents. Showing lack of respect can kick you out of your job. Being respectful will show others that you are serious about getting the job. Referring back to what I said about lack of respect, an example of that can be: coming to work and being in a grumpy mood and telling people mean things can get you to lose your job. Thats why I think its always right to be in the best attitude you could possibly be in no matter what you are going on outside of work. The amount of responsibilities I will receive is no match for me. In other words, If you hand me 2 stacks of paper and give me 2 days to fill it out, I will. Giving me orders is another thing that i would follow, even if I dont want to do it. If I had a chance to work with kindergartners, the ones that struggle and are not comprehending what is being taught. I would stay after school with them for as long as they need until they understand and can accomplish what they didnt get in the beginning. I will always go out of my way in trying to help kids understand the material they need. Another thing is, grading homework and making sure they get it back. I feel like most teachers lack in making sure they grade their students test and not returning it on time. I would make it a priority to make sure it gets done. In conclusion, I think I would be a great person to hire. Seeing and meeting people will improve my knowledge and how to work with others. I will get a be able things once, maybe twice, in my lifetime. This experience will make me a better person. I think I would be great for this position because I am a well rounded person, very respectful, and responsible.

167,3295,76FB58BB4BD7,"when i first came to the U.S.A i was not able to speak English, and every time i went out to play or go to school people were showing me examples of what to do or where to do same for me if i want to go play soccer or go to the play ground ill point outside the window or draw a picture of it, i tried to come up with anther way to example what i want but examples was the only think avalibel for me until i learned English.

168,3296,CBF62E8FFA1B,"In my opinion, I think that true self-esteem comes from achievement and the only reason I think that is because when I achieve something huge say I got a very good grade on my project or got an acceptance letter from my dream college, it would make me feel great about myself and raise my self-esteem. It does not come from praise, when I hear the word praise I think of people praising you and you shouldnt rely on people to bring your self-esteem up. To know that you did a good job by seeing the acheivement it makes a person feel like they can do anything. I see why they say praising can bring self-esteem up, it is because people love to hear from others how well they did or how what they did was so incredible. Words can bring self-esteem up and I know this from experience. However you do not need peoples words to build your self-esteem up its more a want then a need. Achievement is what you need to build your confidence up in yourself not words, I mean sure its nice to get a couple compliments here and there but not for satisfaction. To acheive is like to do something outside of your bubble to make you feel like you can do anything, effort needs to be put in to achieve. I think our society now expects that getting praised is like the best thing but those people are the ones who realize that in the end thats not something that build your self-esteem up, sure itll make them feel good for a little bit, but in my head I thought you dont need to depend on anybody to satisfy you as long as youre doing you and succeeding in life. I hope people come to their senses and realize that they cannot live their lives happy and succesful being praised their whole life they need to praise themselves. I used to be a person who loved getting praised for doing a good job or achieveing something I never praised myself though I wanted to. I realized then the praising is not gonna get me through my teenager years, early twenties and late twenties, I had to learn on my own to know that if I put the effort in something I will achieve. I feel like this whole praising, effort, achievement thing is all like one big repeat, put in effort, praise to boost up your confidence and then in the end achieve its all linked together but peoples words are not going to satisfy you throughout your academic life its like asking for attention right there, give yourself all the attention to achieve in life not to fail, I have praised myself so much that I got so many positive thoughts in my head telling myself keep pushing,your almost there,your going to graduate as long as the achievement matches the effort put in to achieve. Ive always been that child that wanted to make everybody around me proud especially my parents, I want to show the people that have doubted me my whole life that I can do anything I can achieve its just all if I put in effort or not. True self-esteem comes from achievement not from praise and if I didnt know that in my heart as true I wouldnt be the person I am today, suceeding.

169,3297,BF0AF86DFDE1,"I agree with the plan of having an afterschool homework club. Because some students have a hard time finishing homework by themselves and if teachers stay with the students to help them finish their homework that would be amazing because that would mean less students failing. Also some kids might not have computers or any electronic device in their houses. Although if their is no afterschool homework club that may be good because students cant get help from any teachers and that could be good because they can know that not everything in life is easy unless you are good at it or try your best and your hardest. Another good reason that I think might be good for having afterschool homework clubs is that sudnets get a chance to enteract with other students and they also get a chance to veiw or examine how the other students do their own homework. Some kids migh take advantage of having afterschool homework club by cheating the answers off of somebody and then leaving. So I think if the afterschool homework club shouldnt let students look at each others work until they are done. And some kids may take it as fun club and talk through the whole thing. But there is always the kids that do what they are supposed to do. They do not play around,joke around, and distract anyone from doing what they are supposed to do. So, at the end I think that there should be an afterschool homework club because there is more details to back it up then there is for backing up not having the afterschool homework program. And alot of kids could change their work habbit and not get as much as bad grades. And mostly kids who care about their grades would want to join so there is high chance that kid do what they are supposed to do.

Each of every students can catch a mistake. It would benefits to get more information about what topic they will do it. Firstly, you can look more than one idea. Secondly, each students can make one question about what they are doing. Thirdly, if you work in group you can be more comfortable with your work. Your working should have the best idea and should not be any mistake because before to give the work to the teacher every students should look at it. It would be more interesting to meet another students and know what they can do it, and if you can help in something that they dont it. Also, in some schooler teacher let student to work in group because some students dont feel comfortable to do the work by themselves. Some activities should be necessary to do in group. For example, when they are doing a project. However, most of the classses have workshit to do in group. For example, make experiment in a lab, present in front of the class. Some students say that work in group is more funny than being alone. Sometimes, teacher dont like to put student in group becasue they observe that when student are in group they just talk about anothers thnig not about what they tell you , but not all the students like that. In conclusion, for these reasons is more benefits to work and group than work alone.

A meal contains:the main course, a side of vegetable or fruit,and a drink of our choice. Given a healthier meal we will be productive in school,and our everyday life. Eating a healthier meal will reduce the chances of being obitisty. A lack of a bad food would result the chances of not getting enough knowledge,compare to having a healthy meal. The school cafeteria should serve a healthy meal. Students look forward eating lunch during school,because lunch refuels the mind,and the body with important victims. Lunch is the second important meal of the day,because students look toward a short break during school to refill their body,and mind. Eating a healthy meal in the middle of day will help students pay attention during school. Junk food is bad to serve during lunch, because it wont allow the students to be more active during the day,and pay attention in class. Overall students need a healthy meal to go on with there life during school,and outside school. Throughout the years the chances of being obesity has increased. One of the main reasons why is because school lunches has served unhealty food. Junk food is unhealthy for the human body,because getting enough food will make you gain weight. Calories are based on what you eat,eating unhealthy will make you gain weight while eating healthy will help you balance out calories. Eating healthy will help reduce the chances of being obesity. Eating a health meal during school will make the students be productive during school. Biting into an apple is the same thing, as drinking a sip of coffee. If we dont serve healthy food the chances of being active in school will decreases. If we serve our students unhealthy food than they will be lazy throughout the day. Giving the students a healthy meal will make them be more productive. Therefor serving your students a health meal for lunch will help them accomplish obstacles in school. Serving your students will help them improve of being smart. Knowing that if you serve your students healthy options on what to eat they will not be obese. Productive is based on what we eat. If you serve unhealthy food you the chances of being smart,being fit,and active in school will decrease.

Second, is that the tecnology can do part of the work, for example you are writing a note for a paty, ceremony, marry, whatever, and it have to be one for each person, what are you woing to do? just by using the technnology you can print evrithing you want, it makes easy your work, also have more time to do something else.

One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves. The act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. It should be said that people are not born kind, they choose their own traits that fits them best. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future. Rudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world. The helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they dont go anywhere. My counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are. We choose our own character traits. One example of a character trait is the act of kindness, a person who is friendly to all the people that comes their way. A second example of a character trait is rudeness, these types of people are generally rude to everyone that comes their way.

But last year I started being a cartoonist and start writing newspapers and drawing cartoons for the newspapers. At School I join the animate club and then I started drawing pictures for the scenes of the cartoon. And I like it. So I join the yearbook club and I started writing the captions under the photos.

And other kind of stuff let give you some specific reasons. detail#1: I think that writing can impress you detail#2: Writing can also contain facts and opinions detail#3: Writing can also have poems So for art is everything Art is everything It can be all around us And ,but also writing can have vocabulary and it is for spelling. But you must check your spelling whenever you are done with an article or an essay. And it also contains art. But also for art it shows like it graphic novels authors must make bubble speeches for the people it the book to say. Whenever they are happy, sad, or other kinds of feelings. But it contains all kinds of words and languages for people to say ,and the bold means what is important and what it really means. But it means whenever a person reads a book. And what it have to say what it self. My conclusion is that in the future I continue to think about my talents and skills and what they really means to me. But still I think I still care about it.

Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become. Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night. In conclusion the person we become is built by influences beyond our control and we can not just change when we want to.

190,3318,5B2FC963E89D,"A person life, is like a little story, there way to think or act goes with what they have been though, some have gone from easiest to harder situations, there are many situations that people go through all the times. There own way to be, the way they go through situations, makes people take decisions or actions that someone that has gone through the same situation can help them inspired or make positive things in there life. Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life. There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful. A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you. Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you. When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things. Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again. Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that. But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self. There always going to be good or bad moments sometimes you experience something that can make them be that person who inspires, I think it can definitely inspired someones action. A behavior can influence others, but everyone has different ways to think and it is not necessary if they watch someone doing a positive or negative thing will influence them is all in they way they want to act, the kind of person they are and the way they think. But it is a good thing to inspired other and make them look what you have been trough and be a part f a influence that someone can be touch or identify by your life ",4,4,6,4,5,5,1180,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

193,3321,48ADCBFC8376,"Do you think Students should know what career they want by the time they""re in high school? I dont think so because students will feel pressured and probably wont know what they want to do until after of high school. But some argue that students should know what to do while in high school. In my opinion, students should not feel rushed on their career because students would feel pressured and students probably wont know what to do until after they get out of high school. although, some would argue that students would be well prepared to study that job during high school. My first example is that students should take their time. If students take their time and still think about it, they can have different options. Instead of pressuring them they should let them learn new things in school because they can check out a lot of different jobs they can be interested in and take it after school . Another thing is that students can focus more on their school work, education, and focus on graduating. Some students cant focus on careers during high school because they need to figure out what classes they have to take and pass in order to graduate from high school, and then focus on a career. So I think students should take their time on their own pace and figure it out little by little. My second example is that students wont figure it out until after high school and if needed, take some time of from school . Students if they choose a career after school they can focus on that specific job and not worry about anything else besides their interest. they can focus more on their career that they chose because they dont focus on anything else school related, and give their full on attentions to their job. One other thing is that students after high school will feel less stressed and more relaxed. they can take however much time off on thinking what job to get. Whenever they are ready to get a job they go to collage and study for it. I think students should feel stress free. Some would argue that students should know what to do career they want to do during high school. For example students will know what to study for, before they get that job. Also, they can be well prepared and learn a lot of new things for the job. Sure students can be well prepared and learn about the job way before. however, students shouldnt have a lot of stress on them with school and their future career at the same time. Also, students grades will probably dramaticly go down because they try to focus on both things. In conclusion, I think that students should not feel rushed. They will feel pressured and wont know until maybe after school. But some people think that they should know while in high school because they will be prepared confident for the job. I dont think that they should stress themselves a lot. so that they can focus on their education and focus on graduating and make their family proud.

The students will have more time to do their homeworks to concentrate more in classes. Many high schools the tradicional is four years of high school that is a good choice for the students. Students will have more experience having four years of high school. The students will learn more things in one more year of high school. The benefits taking four years of high school. Students are able to take elective classes. Concentrate more taking four years of high school. Students will have more time to do their homeworks. Students will be more prepare for college. They will have more time to study for the exams. Free time. Less stress. I do not recomment to the students take three years of high school. Because there is many classes that students cannot take that are elective classes take three years of high school is not a good choice for the students who work after school. 2. Three years of school. More stress. The students will do not have enough time. The students will do not concentrate in classes. Not pay atention in classes.

I think we should ask people for there opinion because they might have a better thought. For example if you wanted to go shopping for cloths and you dont know which one to pick. People will give options of what they think and they can tell you which one they prefer more. There are variety options you can pick from. You can choose your own and ask people if they like it or not. If you dont know which one to pick between two options. You can ask friends, family, or anyone you feel comfuterble with you can get an idea which one you want more. Its always a good thing to ask for people opinion.

196,3324,D43F13CE2638,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something?, Or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. This question is fairly easy because if you just simply do nothing, Then nothing would be accomplished, Unless you believe in ""when the times right etc."" but sitting around doesnt make you more successful, For example if you wanted to be very successful you have to work with it. Like staying after school to study for the SOL the very next day, Or remembering to do all your chores before your parents came back from work. But on the other hand doing nothing can also accomplish many things. For example if you were to be in a car accident and broke several bones then obviously youll be in a wheel chair for several months and You wont be able to move at all. And doing so will help you accomplish healing, Your doing nothing but still getting better at the same time. Have you herd of the saying ""All good things happen to those who wait"" this means it could be a normal day then suddenly something really good comes to you like either you find a job or the love of your life and have a happy ending. There are other ways too, for example theirs a saying ""dont mess with something that doesnt need to be messed with"" and ""Theres light at the end of the tunnel"" these quotes connect in a way because sometimes some things should be left alone and over time something good will come to it, like you able to accomplish your goals. Or maybe your the type of person to let Fiat decide, so you let things happen naturally. Overall you can accomplish many tasks for both doing and not doing anything, But in my opinion you can accomplish more when your doing more because your working for whatever it is your aiming for.

Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying. When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day. Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much youll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything youve been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because Ive been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home Id play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life. Some people dont like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts. In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that youll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal. To sum this all up just do at what you do best in life maybe it can pay off real good.``",6,7,7,9,7,7,2937,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
198,3326,F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements. True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and its the cause of someones self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month. Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that cant start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they dont feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how theyre feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they dont want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who cant learn if she doesnt feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesnt feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning. Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If youre being praised for something good youve done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals. In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"".

If the school menu changes then Generic_Name would not go to the cafeteria during lunch. Because of his allergies, Generic_Name have to stay away of those kinds of vegetables. For students like Generic_Name, the principal should reconsider the idea of not changing the school lunch menu. Overall, the change of the school lunch menu would not be benefit for some students. Secondly, changing the school lunch menu is a bad idea because students favorite food would be eliminate. For example, some students favorite foods are pizza and hamburgers. If the school cafeteria changes its menu then many students would not eat because the cafeteria would not have their favorite food. For those students who would not eat, the school cafeteria will waste the food. Overall, by changing the school lunch menu can lead the cafeteria to waste food. Some students might argue that changing the school lunch menu is a good idea. They argue that by changing the lunch menu students will have a healthier life. This point has merit; however, the change of the school lunch menu is a bad idea because others cannot decide what students should eat or not.

Educators argue that there should be a year-around school, where there would be a 3-4 week off in the spring and fall. But as a student, my position is the opposite of what some educators believe. If our summer keeps as all this past years we can do so many things. When our summer vacations arrive is when all students fell free and out of pression of passing the course year. Summer vacations also open different doors in our life, students chooises are vacations and traveling, others prefer to work, gain money and experience for our future. If summer vacations will be shorter not many students could handdle school, beaks in summer, longer winter break and summer would not have the same impact as summer vactions. It can sound exagerate but that wouldnt be much time to us for do our sumer change. First of all, In my own experience I like when summer is coming because I know that new experience are waiting for me, but also I like summer vacations because all the ""suffer"" of final examns and the S.O.L are over once again, and I think passing your goals during the years always deserves and award, in this case, Summer vacations. What educators dont see about summer is that gives us an opportnity to be more responsable; many students like me decide to start working. Working has made me a more responsable man, has teach me how reality is, and that money is not an easy thing, and the easier way I can make money is study. Summer is one of the greates time for students, many students go to new places, to visit old family menbers and pass time whit them. Summer last year gived me the chance to go back to my countrie, I coulnt do it during winter or spring because I have to study, and the time educators think is the best for us wouldt provide the same amount of aventures. More over, When winter break is coming we all happy but it feels too short, adding a few days wouldnt make it so different, plus your adding the same amount of days in four seasons, time for us will pass flying. I also think that many of us would fell like school is never going to end, I would be so stress out that my preformence during the school could be decreasing more and more. Last time I looked an article were they showed a chart, out of 100 student 80 said that they prefere summer vacations over having longers breaks during the year. After that they made an experiment, during a year they sow how was the performence in the students whos choices was summer vacation, and it got prooved that they were doing better because they were constanly going to school. On the other hand, educators are not at all wrong, when I start againg the school year I some times dont remenber thing that I sow the year before. Also having so much vacations makes me miss school, been with my friends and learning new things. Educators may have a diferet opinion than I, and they can be the ones who are correct, they said that summer is too long because of their experience, and maybe they had learn less. Educators are people who know more than students because of their understanding in the power of learnig. In conclusion, summer vacations is the best, and it never has to change the aumount of days that they give to us, is prefectly the days that we all need to refresh from school and things that happened over the year. Summer bring us new experience and it teachs us things like reponsability, a very importat human thing that we all has to have. I beliebe that we things shouldnt change, people and cientificts had prooved that the best way of lerning is how we do it.",7,7,7,7,6,6,2852,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
204,3332,FE2115055812,"I think that my school should not extending the school day per two hours. I feel that dont to be good or necessary for the students. The proposal of increase the school day two hours has the pros and the cons. Im against of extending the school day. I know the pro is that way we save more energy and resources but has more cons, to continue I have three clear reasons. The students to lost one day complete of class, and they needs to learn more of each class material. I think that if the teens study just four-day per week, they will cant to be a good output academic. I have a friend that she studies in another school, her school is not ""common"", And you ask me: ""Why do you tell me ""not common""?"" I can answer you because the school day is similar to the principal question, she study just Monday to Thursday; She told me that is ""cool"" because dont have class on Friday but I think that was ridiculous, I know is funny dont to be class on Friday, is really funny!! but We are need focus in to study, we need to have a purpose that is the school and graduate. Studying four-day to week is not similar than study five-day to week. Some students have a job after school, if they study two hours more per day to week, so the teen would not to be to work almost per four days. They need to work for pay their phones, their clothes, their rent, their food, etc. My cousin have a job after school , he works 5 or 4 days to week. He works because he need the money. When the class is to finish (He can to work that days), his jobs schedule start 4:30pm to 10:30pm, so if the school decide change or increase the two hours per day, my cousin and other teens that have a job, would not to work. The students need more time after school in their home, because they can to do homework or study any quiz or class materials, even any teens have another class in the afternoon, like to study computer, French, Spanish, Arabic, or whatever language , also study arts, math, ballet or whatever dance that they to prefer. Patty is 15 years old, she is a cute girl, she loves to dance class, her dance class start 5pm to 7pm, her schedule is on Monday and Tuesday. On Wednesday she takes computer and Spanish class the same time that dance class. If the school decide follow this model by extending the school day two hours probably she lost her afternoon class In conclusion, I think that should not follow the model be extending the school day two hours, because the students lost one day complete of class,lost the concentration and focusing in the class, would no to get job after school and they would not to study another class after school.

205,3333,642E44E8DD25,"I would like to visit a engineering work place, or company. I would like to learn all about planning how do build something, and to they come up with good building ideas. What is the most hard part that a engineer has to take very series?. If i was able do visit one of these companies i would get very happy. My mom told me that this is a good job, but its a risk that people that want to have this job have to take in order do get pay very well. One of my teacher in Generic_School his dad was a engineer he told me that his dad didnt like math because it was to hard, but he got a job in the engineering company and he good checks. This teacher that im talking about didnt like science, or math and at the end he ended up teaching math, and science he is very good at it, and a very nice teacher too. I think all of this that i talked about is teaching me that i need to have good grades in my prealgebra class. Engineering for me is easy do say, but i wanna experience does hard problems. On Saturdays and Sundays i work with my dad. My dads lets me cut the grass and it not easy, he keeps telling me to get good grades, so i dont have be like him all day in those hot days. I guess that working all day in a very hot summer is not food. My dad taught me that working under the sun is very hard a it makes your back hurt he told me that i need to be better them him. When im older i would get a good job, and i would help my dad, and my mom even dough they told me that when get older they are going to go back to El Salvador , but im still going to help them. I think that i would give engineering a chance if not im going to find another job. thats ones of my job, or company i would like to visit if it was close to my school. Another company, or job would be frying airplanes i is good job i o ways wanted to fly one, but its do hard plus i dont think im going to go to college i think that this jobs are just to hard for me to learn especially me it take a long time for me to remember something. I think i can make it if only i put mu effort on it. My teachers tell me that im smart only when i want to, they o ways tell me to give it a try and i o ways ended up learning it sometimes i think that teachers sometimes understand students and hoe they feel. I get mad when dont understand something. i havent done good in 7, and 8th grade. I think that all of these happen because i made new friends. I think that flying airplanes is much harder then learning engineering, but the only thing i need to do if put my effort in everything I think that is not a bad idea do have some company around schools they should make field trips, kids could ask question that they would like to ask. This essay made me think more about what job would i like to do in the future. I think that i would stay with the engineering job i would like to put all my thoughts in to it and get a good college degrees, and get the job that i dream off. I think that my dream wold come true, and if it does or doesnt well i guess i would learn another thing i pay to go to college and get that job. i will try to make all my family happy and help all of them. Im really good in everything if i only put my mind into it. My name is Genric_Name, and i came to America to get a better future, and to all my SOL thank you for reading my essay.

206,3334,10D3A9E5E79E,"Whlie some people say that doing something that you mastered help you achive your goals, others say that you should try something more challenging to achive more than your goals. Achiving more than yhour goals can get you farther in life, it can make your job or what you like to do exciting, and your education expands. If you think you cannot do it, you are not beliving in yourself. In order to achive your goals and be happy, you have to belive in yourself first. Put yourself to do more than what you expected. Being successful meaning get further in life, have to do with the majority of the world, whats around you, and what you put yourself to do. In my opinion, getting further in life is great, not so many people have the privilages to do what you can. A student once challenged herself by taking chemistry. At first she did not believe that she can do it but hen she ended up passing the class. Do not expect less from what you deserve. Some people do not like their job, so they do a really crappy job. Making your job exciting is great but, how can you make it fun? First find something that you like. Then make a challage every week to be successful, keep in mind that is for the better. Think about it like a game. Everyone likes games meaning that they would like a challege. Education has been a big part of ours lives and will always be. A person can learn from just watching a person characteristics. There is planty ways a person can learn. Be ready for any occasion that happens, mentally ready, emotional ready, and even physically ready. Life is full of surprises and will teach us good and bad things through out the times. Just be your best and learn from every little thing that happen and will happen. In conclusion Emerson is right, ""do something beyond what you already mastered."" Meaning that you should challage yourself and achive more than your actual goals. Believe in yourself and be better each day. In this world everything is like a game but, is to make you better.

One of my reasons that Im not against the after school club is because the students can get there grades up and have more practice when you take any test that you dont know about. For my opinion I would like to have this club because some teachers go really fast when there teaching and I cant catch up to them and its really difficult for me. Some of the students dont know what the teacher is teaching about because maybe the subject there learning is there weakest strength to learn about. My second reason is that students need this class because they want to achieve in life. Maybe someone wants to go to college to learn about photography but the school they want to go to is too expensive to afford like for example they want to go to a well good college but its to expensive but the person who wants to be a photographer needs to apply for a scholarship that means they need to have good grades, participate in after school activity and much more this is why students like me need to have a after school homework club.

For example when you wanna order something online you dont have to calll you can just order it online with out contaction anyone. Technology can help you in manys ways. One way it can help you is by if you dont know the answers to a homework you can go on a computer or even a phone and look up answers and wedsites of where your answers can be. Another way is if you need to do technology work need to be done at home you can use a computer and send an email to your teacher without contacting her about it when your done. To me i see this as a positive effect on people because it can help you succed in school and complete things you need to do as well. There are so many other ways technology can help you as well. when you wanna sign up for soccer you can regrister online. All you have to do is answers qustions put your information and once your done putting your information in you can pay for it and once you pay your coach will get an email that you singed up for his team.

Letting them use phones and tablets would be good so they can learn how to say , words , letters, numberrs, and learn new things before they go to school and already know a couple things.

When a parent dosent know how to use a phone it can be stressfull for them becuase they wouldnt know what to do unless someone is there to help him and do the things the parent needs to do on the one. Also another negative effect is when if you have all work saved in a computer and you get your computer wet and it wont turn on how are you gonna show your boss or teacher your so that would have a big negative effect on the worker. These are sum ways technology can have a negative effect on you. To me technology has a poseitive effect in my life because I can be able to do more things and not have to worry about and contact people to help me do it.

The most important lessons life can give is stand your ground, be more forward with certain individuals, cut what seems to be negative. Individuality can always be a good, sometimes you never need that helping hand because not everyone is helpful. Some try to be the bad person by stepping over you. Most experiences, I myself have gone through were never the best. Everyone might seem like the good person, but we never know what is really behind them. First off, you should simply just stand your ground. Show them that not everything is meant to be worked within two people. Another reason, achieving things on your own shows you a lot of things you never knew before. One of those might be you have made through school by yourself and got your diploma. Accomplishment comes with many struggles and steps. Not just anyone makes it through; some give up because maybe others told them that not everything is for them. Lastly, cut out certain people that you know never got you anywhere. Everyday is a lesson if we recognize it or not. Some days are harder than others, but there is never a day you should give.

216,3344,42587039161D,Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house. Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons. So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay. ,5,4,5,5,5,4,868,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student dont have the time and sometimes they dont turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time. When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just dont talk to people a lot. Having different environment could help you to learn more and plus you would not be by your self. Have other people with you in the same room. Not just you home by yourself with a computer. Having classes online you would not be sou round with people your age. Doing online class sometimes could give out a lot of work to do in one day. In the same day you have to turn it in. It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just dont understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date. The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you dont expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you dont know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work. Attending classes online dose not always work out for students. ",7,6,6,6,5,6,3184,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

For example at the job alot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you dont want to do nothing. Insted that the employees at your job dont know that you are tired because you have two jobs. Some people, students or parents lived so tire and they look idle. At my house we live all togethers and sometime i dont to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i dont clean the house. For example that i dont study or help my mom with my little brother. In addition my family doesnt know that i have tow jobs because i want to help her to play the rent of the house, that why some people lookd idle or tired.

Churchills statement bring a beautiful statement of what successful can be signify in our life, so success its something what everyone can obtain in any situation, however, its the most wonderful opportunity for our own willingness,while, in my other hand failure means practice of our own future, because failure its just the perfect manner to learn, to be better with the past of the time. How your going to teach your childrens, if you didnt make mistakes? Failure make people with experience, ""if you dont make mistakes,you dont learn"" and you cant teach other people, when they are in warning to make the same mistakes that you did before, this is a great example of family, so you need to be the example of your childrens helping to show the danger, but as well the wonderful manner to see the failure with enthusiasm to commence again. The failure make better people? absolutely, because mistakes sample the things what we didnt wanted to see before; failure to failure probably its tired, but have a great recompense; failure prepare our own life, for example if we failure the test, probably next time we are going to study better than the first time, but we get a great experience to see with better perspective than before. The point of failure is what we need to live failure in our own life, for understand and see with different perspective than before, failure create a maturity person with experience, and big knowledge;however this great statement its a example of persevered,progress, and growth in our own life to get experience, maturity, productivity, and fortress. My conclusion is basically in the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, so make mistakes is no bad its part of life, just dont give up and show that we can be better, we can do better than before;failure is the teacher of your future, dont be fear on what people can be say about your decisions, or you manner of see your failure, its fine make mistakes ""we learn something new"",but its important the manner that we see it, with enthusiasm or sadness?,because we continue,we start again,and we can get better results.

As we go out everyday to complete our duties in the schools building, we consume energy from the sky lights and others useful lights, the computers, and laptops. Also the food students receive in school as a lunch. Plus students frequently purchase gas to come to school; due that some students need to come in their own cars or public buses, because they dont live around the school area. Additionally students that are currently having a part-time job will be able to work more. In the case of student who are not working in a part-time job would get one more day added to the weekend, and they would be able to spend more time doing family activities or having a good time with friends, and close people. To start with, reducing the consume of energy will help with our planet; energy is produced with some elements and one of them and a very important one is: water. The less energy we use or waist the less will be the affect for our planet. Adopting the four-days school week will make all of us stay at home on Fridays and reduce the energy use from the school when using lights, computers and laptop that need to be charged. Secondly, If students come to school only for four days, the food that they usually obtain on Fridays will be saved and use for the next Monday; that way saving food will start to be a good benefit for conserving resources. Also some students come to this school but they living in a different city not closely to school; they purchases gas every week and they have to spend money, Therefore if they only come for four days a week; they will saved gas for the weekends or for the next week of school. Thats one of the best ways to conserve cars energy and resources; due to that gas use petroleum to be produced and other substances and chemicals that come from our planet soil grounds or others areas. Lastly, Students will obtain benefit by adopting this for-days school week as well, because the students that are currently working in a part-time job will obtain the opportunity to work a full day on Fridays, they will be able to increase their revenue. In the case for students that dont have a job, they will have extra time to do homework, projects, and family activities as well. Even thought, they are students with a different point of view, when it comes to adopting a four-day school week. they argue that adding two more hours to the regular school day, will be more exhausted and they will have less hours to work in their part-time jobs.

When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. Dont be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that. Reasons why people fail. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. people need to understand other problems and help them. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better. When someone break his/her leg. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. because he/she think that its very painful.

233,3361,DF23B896A1C2,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said, A Problem is a change for you to do your best. I agree with that stamens because when you have a problem it a chance for you to to your best and overcome it. Unfortunately that not the case. Mostly in sports you are driven to do your best when losing. But adults tend not to do there best when facing a problem. You should be always motivated to do your best. If you play any sports you know that when you are losing you are motivated to do your best. No mater how many points you are losing by you try your best to make that come back and win the game. If you dont win that game you at least know that you tried your best. If you were to give up you would have wondered, if you tried would I have won. This not the only example, for example you boss is about to fire you and try you best to keep that job. There are many more examples you can try to be your best. Some times adults have to face problem and they dont know what to do or how to face that problem, they think there nothing they can do. They give up form the start they dont try there best when facing that problem. They simply give up. They miss out on that chance. For example, My dad got fired from his job, he was depressed and did not care at all about anything. He did not try his best. he simply gave up. But you should never give up always give it your best no matter what. Form trying your best you dont lose any thing you only gain something. you cant follow you dreams without trying you best, does not matter what you want to be. you will face problems no matter what path you take. For example bill gates he did not become one of the most successful people by doing nothing. he gave it his best. So why should you not give it your best . No matter who you are, you should take the words of Duke Ellington and try you best when facing a problem. Does not matter if you are playing sports or having a issue at work. or trying to achieve you dreams . Never fail to give it your best, or you will regret it.

235,3363,E883A8265183,"Is working with a group is Benefits? In my opinion working with a group is better then working by yourself,becuase when we work as a group we can finish our work faster then working alone furthermore in group work you can make new friends,you can learn how to work as a team because in group work you have to make sure you are being nice to your team mates and you must listen to everyone else point of viewe in group work people you learn how to respect others. Working with a group have more benefits then woking alone becuase if you have a big project to do and your teacher allows you to work as an group but you choose not to join any group and decide to work alone so this will be hard for you to complete the project on time and the people who join the group can easily complete the project before you because they can help each other this is the biggiest benefit of working with a group. In group work all the members of the group have to do equal work and this way they can do their part of the project very easily and if they work alone they are not abel to work that well because they have no one else to gave them advice or any kind of help therefore group work is always benefit. Some people might think that group work should not be allow but in my opinion group work is the best way to study becuase this way you learn about how to be nice to some one and how to be responsibel for your work becuase in team work you always have to do some part of the work which your team memebers told you to do and you all can share your thoughts about your work and can get better grade on the project Group work always gives you benefits.",4,4,6,6,5,4,3369,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
236,3364,DEDD5C568B4C,"I agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself. The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them. Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well. Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them. Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun . The second reason you need to be honest is with your family . You got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. What happens if your Mom or Dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. They just checking on you and for your safety. Your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. You never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed. The lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family. The third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. You have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. For Example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . You have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. In my opinion I would say no to person who is selling the drugs. This actually can happen in real life . If you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . The lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself.

I think this will be an enjoyable activity for school because you can meet new people, work with a team, and most of all have a great time. During the play the cast members can make new friends and meet new people. Its important that the cast gets to know each other and become friends. Also they can rehears lines together. Its also helpful to make new friends especially if you shy. Its important not to be shy on the night of the actually play. You have to be brave and have confidence in yourself for the night of the play. Another example why this this would be an enjoyable activity for school is working together as a team. Working together as a team can be enjoyable and important. For example the cast can help build sets, make costumes, rehears lines, and so much more. Sometimes after rehearsals the cast can go out to eat or have fun. also working together as a team is easier so you can get more work done. The last reason why having a play is enjoyable because after all the hard work with the team everyone can watch the play. You will be able to perform the play in front of students,teachers,friends,and families. The most important thing is that you had a fun time making, being in the play, and working with other students. Being in a play is and enjoyable activity because you can meet new people, work as a team,and have fun. Those were a couple of reasons and examples on why having a school play is an enjoyable school and educational activity.

Have you ever heard people saying ""i want to go to the movies but i have go to the store."" I bet there is people out there. they like to go out, but they have so much to do that they cant and is not a problem because we have technology that can help us with stuff that we need without going to the store or deal with people humors. also, you can save time to use it in another activities like you can go and have fun with the family or friends. however theres people that theyre against technology, and everyone has they opinion about it. Unfortunately we still have technology that we can use it. Theres people who like to use technology because its a new way to see the world. they can get so much done using technology like they can create new things like: new cars, new smart-phones, new styles of clothing, and so much more like its unique way to see what can technology do for us without taking us so much time. But they are people who still think that doing stuff in the old way is the same, i mean everyone has the own description of things. personally i think without technology will take us so much to make new stuff so unfortenely technology we get done some amazing things.

Also, it would be a good opportunitie for them to get done their career at a young age and start making money from what they are apassionated on it farthermore, some young people are interest in work on what they like and this could be a great apportunitie for them to commit to a career and start workin on what they have been apassionated on it and get a job that it would be able to made their families proud of them.

The reason are so many and complicated to explain right now, that is why I am only gonna explain and give example to three of those reason. One of them are that students should not go to college at very early age or go to the minlatary at very early age, Because of the their are not older anough and are not anough responsible handle to much presur in college and in high school, and most ot the time they dont really know what they want to be when grow up, and the course during summer and evenings are not much presur for the students. They dont have the experience about what is life look like and how harts it is. They would not have any freedom duirng their all life if they follow that plan, because they always will be ""between four walls"", thats not the life that people want and thats not the sad path that parents want for the children I guess and I hope, but you never now what parents want and never ask what you want, and is another presur on their shoulders. The elective courses are a way to expriment other classes and learn something else that students really want to do or maybe would like to do, I admint that students will learn the necessary, but not what they want, their will be sad if they never had a freedom to do what they want to.

241,3369,F78366DD5A31,"The decision regarding extracurricular involvement should be left to students and their family because, students know how to mange their time, families would remind or help out, and teachers give students time to finish or study assignments. As a senior in high school, I attend to many activities after school and still have plenty of time to complete assignments. I believe, that managing time is key on getting everything done on time. In the past, I have asked teachers on how I could mange my time and still have time to complete assignments. After having that conversation, I had improved my grades and also had time for activities. Thats why I think managing time is a good way to complete school work and finish any outside activities. If my family were to see me go out a lot or come back late from any activity without completing my work, they would talk to me and find a way to help me out. After that, they would see my grades and check for any late assignments because, there is no family that would like for their son/daughter to have bad grades in school. Many students would not pay attention on their grades and go outside thinking that they have nothing due for any classes. Although, thats when families come in and remind their child that they have assignments to complete before they go outside. This is why families are good reminders and helpers on getting good grades. Teachers in high school give students enough time to complete assignments or study during class. I tend to complete it during class because I like to go home and not worry about any school work. Overtime if a student does not finish their homework, teachers tend to say that they gave us time to complete it during class. However, I do not make that same mistake and finish my work during class, so that the teacher would not bother me. That is why taking advantage on finishing working during class, is a good why to have time for any outside activity. That is why schools should not control any student, and regarding extracurricular involment shall be left to students and their families.

242,3370,F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing. For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream. Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things. If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is theyt go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono cant be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up. That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life. All the persons are not the same one they has more technology to they dream,but others person not and this is not one obstacle to make they dream. Because all the time are be doing something and not wait to came things came not they go find and work hard to make all be came to be positibe they not have obstacles they have the strong to be come a better person. And show everyone not matter how difficult are the problem they came be successfuly person. Like Thomas Jefferson say always diong somethings much be done and is true because the person came to this life and learng everything, a lot person move to other place, need to learng need lenguage, need tradititiones and need people is hard but with the time can be learnig everything and continue the life again with need stuff thas is what is important to always diong on and be done what they need to be done and make sure do the best and hork hard and show a good and strong personality. And accomplish more if always theyre something on specific point of life can to be so difficult but working hard and with discipline all can be come more aesy and undertake a new dream and new stuff of life can be come the best tool to widely and known as the most expert guidance to life.

244,3372,822F6C3B3C03,"I agree with Thomas Jefferson quote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" because yes we may always be doing something but we never really put in mind what we really are going to do. One way to be able to accomplish things is if you have a goal set. If you set a goal that means you are going to want to achieve it. Prove others that you can do it and that nothing can stop you from doing it. Always give it your best, never think negative because if you think negative then youre never going to accomplish anything in life. Prove to yourself that you can also try new things and that can help you a lot. Always be confident in yourself no matter what. Always put in mind that you can do whatever you want to do. For example, if you have to mow the lawn but youre in your bedroom laying down looking out the window, the lawn isnt going to mow itself because it needs someone to move it around. Trying new things doesnt hurt at least trying for quite some time and it also benefits you because youre doing something for your own good. Never use laziness as an excuse to not do anything. If you always say im tired then youre never going to do anything, youre just giving up on yourself. For example, if you hate being home all day doing nothing, then go out go find what you can do because if you try new things youll end up liking it. If youre an active person youll accomplish way more than expected because youre going to be moving around and getting out youre comfort zone. Helping others also can be a way in accomplishing more than just sitting there because youre talking to someone or showing someone how to do something. Helping the community in many different ways can also be a good thing but not just for you but the community, because youre going out and helping. Doing and trying new things motivates you to keep doing more. I strongly do believe that if youre doing something that you put your mind to, then youre always going to accomplish more than expected. If you sit down and say youre going to do something youll never do it because youre just sitting down. Your words are way different than your actions. To be able to do something you have to get up from the couch and do it without having to think so hard about it.

Even though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to ""look"" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much. Albert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\space stuff. Imagination is a real thing. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do. Life is full of bad people. If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to ""think before you act."" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, youre going to get in trouble. What if bad people that are in jail right now, wouldve thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act. You might also want to ""imagine"" what would happen to you in the future if you did something wrong. Another good reason is to learn from your mistakes. Since you already did them youre have a good visual of what you might expect to happen to you in the future if you did something wrong without thinking about it. you might also want to have knowledge because if you thought of the consequences and or imagined them, you wouldnt of done it in the first place.",7,9,9,9,8,8,2246,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 7"

252,3380,4B907938595D,"Technology can be healthy in my life? I believe that this prompt will have negative effects in my life. Sometimes we need talk to somebody, we need help, we need to be sociable with people that is around me. Everyone can be sociable without technology. Technology can help us with things that could be hard for us but sometimes, we need to be sociable ass well. The technology cannot be my friend because at the beginning we can feel satisfaction with technology. After, well see that technology is not everything and i start to asking my self what i do? where is everyone? and i never spent to much time with my family, friends, mom, dad. In fact, i can changes my mind and do the right things. Sometimes, spent time with my family can help me because we can talk without phones, for example: When we are going to eat, nobody can have their phones in the table because my parents said that technology will be disrespectful and also, technology can take out my time with my family for example: Sometimes i need to do my test at home or homework but, i stay in the computer and i never go to eat with my family thats for i said that we can enjoy, and spend a lot of time with our parents. The communication is very important in our life. If we have homework, work ships. We can share our ideas and help us each other for example: When i came here at the united states i dont even know English and i was scared in my first day at school because i thought that nobody could speak Spanish for help me but, there was many people to help me and give me information about what the teacher said. Now i understand and i can defect my self with English thats for i said the communication is very important in our life. In conclusion the technology can be a negative idea in our life because we just want to play in the computer or phones. Sometimes, the technology can help us in so many things for example: test, and work ships but, when we have time with our family, we has to enjoy, and pay attention to then.

I would love to be studying from my house because I would never have any distractions, and I can just stay comfortable the whole time. People say online school is better than online school, but online school is more comfortable and nicer for students because they dont have to get dressed and ready just for school, they can take their time with the school work, and they have more time to do more stuff like get a job or play a sport. A lot of students get stressed in the morning because they dont know what to wear for school. What if they didnt have to worry about that anymore? I dont like to get up just to dress and get ready for school. Online school, the type of school that students dont have to worry about what you wear or how people think of you because no one will ever see you. We all get lazy at some point in life, and we just want somethinh that will make us feel comfortable while studying. All students get rushed because they have too much work to do, and sometimes, they dont do it on time because its too stressful for them to finish it all. Online school gives you a long time to finish all your work and maybe a little extra time to relax. My friends and I are always stressed because of how much school work we have to do, but if we could do online school, it would all be so easy and less stressful. Online school is the best way to get time for all your work. Everyone that goes to a school knows how hard it is to keep up with the work and what they do outside of school. Maybe its a sport or a job or it could be both. It would be great if we all had that extra time to do all that without stressing. I rarely have time for school and work , but my friend, Generic_Name, does online school, and she has all time she needs to finish her school work, go to her job, and play lacrosse. Some might say that going to a normal school is the best way to study; however, online school is a better and safer for students because they are able to take their time with the school work. they dont need to get up and stress themselves about what they should wear or how they look, and they have more time for other stuffthat arent related to school like sports or jobs. How nice would it be if we didnt have to worry about any of these problems? Online school will have you relaxed most of the time.

254,3382,54AC60510DC3,"Dear Districts School: I am writing to express my support for the proposal to require that students can finish high school in three years. I am in favor of this proposal for two reasons. One reason I am in favor that students can finish high school in three years is because some students they dont be able to take elective class and they dont have to waste their time to take another class. Most students can have more time to think and choose what career they want to continue to study. Since, they would like to go to the college and finish their career and get better job in their future. Another reason I am in favor of this offer is because students can have their opportunity to start to work more and save their money to continue to study. However, some students they dont have family or helper that can help to them to continue to study. Although, students need to work hard to graduate more early, but they have to keep this opportunity that this programs offer for them. Therefore, because this programs offer opportunity for students that want to finish their high school more early and if they want to continue to study they can take their time to work. I am agree with this proposal of this programs that students can finish their high school in three years. Thank you for taking my support.

There are many other ways to help students improve in their behavior and achievement. Homework is just a way to reinforce the main study. If the Principal decides to establish this ""Club,"" it will make the homework easier.

But in my opinion I would say that one that is more beneficial is working in a group. Working in a group is less work and more ideas. As I was saying that their are advantages and disadvantages, My first advantage of working alone is that you get to work alone with no distraction from others. Second advantage is that you can focus and ask the teacher for help. Last reason is that you can put as many ideas you want and a lot of effort and ask the teacher to check your work to see how you doing working. The disadvantage of working alone is that you will not get the work done faster. My second reason is that working alone is not fun because you working independent and doing all the work. My first advantage is that working in group you get to hear different ideas from each other. My second advantage is that you can talk together and gets lots of ideas and fix mistakes together. Last advantage is that working in a group you can finish the work faster. The first disadvantage is that working in a group their is going to be too much talking and also not focusing. Second disadvantage is that when you are working together some times one person does the whole work and the other doesnt. Last disadvantage is that you can easily get destructive and not get the work done. To conclude this I think working in a group is more beneficial.

Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,for example,my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer,she said that as a student,she was preparing herself for the future,thanks to school,they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called ""Everything is possible,if you believe it""she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president,also there is a story about her in the internet,she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity. I as a student I will have the experience to explore and get some knowledge at a young age of the opportunities that I can be able to get if I prepare to have a amazing future for example,I read about an incredible woman who know is a professional chemistry teacher ,in the story gave details about how she became who she is it doesnt specific which company she went to learn about her career,but the point is that she has an excellent job,because she got prepare for it.

He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time. To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier. Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule. And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care. In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week?

Schools should have to extended two hour more for a four day school week. It will leave less time for students to do there school work and sports activities through out the day.

If schools extended two hour more from the normal time theyll leave around five in the evening leaving them less time less for homework.

It will ruin students sleeping schedule. If students are still up late trying to finish there homework, are getting less sleep. Students that have after school sports would stay up later to finish up things they havent finished. The students that come to school tired always gets less sleep. If a student have a test the nest day and stay up studying, they will come to school too tired to take the test. Others may say having a four day school week would be great. It will be less stressful for students. Students wont have to worry about school as much and it will leave them more time to do homework on the days off.

Im agree with the statement about the importance to have a positive attitude in life, because thats one point at favor that can helps us for work hard everyday and give the best that we can do and had a success in everything we can make and do in life. However, depend on people,how much they want have success in their life and if theyre a positive people for work hard and have what they want in their life and give a better life to their next generation. Success in life is not just to talk about the everything is going to be easy for us,but it the depend how the people think and how much they want to have succesful life,somethings youre going to feel the everythings is hard and not the way the you think but you keep faighting because you have one reason why you work that hard for give to their family a better economic and education, when we talk about a better economic and education were talking about to proper a better future for ours sons and daugheters for one day they can have everything and dont be worry about to work for have money for collage or university that one reason why people have a positive attitude and want to have a succesful in their life. Positive attitude, Change they way of people think, for example my father is man who dont have a good education but he has a positive attitude and the way he works hard for give to my family the best he can take is super wonderful, because he is showing me the when you want something you have to work super hard and put on your mind the you can do anything you want and depend if you like to do it, he is always tell me a goods advice and giving me a big lesson the i have to learn in life for have a better future. Another point the affect so much today in day is the way the people think ,depend so much how you look the things and think about it if you can really make or some people they fast get desolution when something do not work for they and the way they wanna, but everything depend how that person works and how much love him or her put for get a good result, but thats not the end of everything, people have many change and tryies in life, is something doesnt work for you have to let go and look for another change and you need to have in your mind a positive attitude the you can make or do doesnt matter how many times you try for get that job the you like or the car the you wish with all your haerth of the house of dream, everuthing depend how hard you work and how much you faight how have the things the you wish to have in your life and everything have a one reason why you work hard in your life. In my conclusion have a positive attitude is very important for have a succesful life and that helps people to have a vision why and why you work hard everyday of their life and show the importance the you need to have it and the controls of your mind and the power of make or do what you want to have in your life. doesnt matter how hard was for get there but one day youre gonna see and say i make all these when you finally are there you going to see the everything hads one reason why you do all those stuff and youre gonna be happy and thats one thing of many reason why we need to have a positive attitude in our life.",6,6,6,6,5,6,1235,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
273,3401,DBE977177080,"Have you ever found something on the ground and picked it up and pretended that is was yours. That right there is called a lie and its really bad because you dont know if that money you found or that toy you found was somebods when they come back to look for it its gone because somebody else just walked away with there stuff that they spent there money on. When I was a kid I would always see this stuff, people would drop there stuff and I would pick it up and give it back to them or tell them they dropped it and hand it over to them. Usually when people find stuff just laying around the first thing to come to mind is take it but that isnt very smart because you never know whos it is or where it came from, and taking if its not your is stealing. Many people say leave it where you found it because people will comeback looking for there stuff, because nobody leaves there stuff somewhere and then just walks away with out knowing or caring. I know many schools teach this because when I was at my elementary school there would always be signs all over the place talking about leave it where you found it and dont take whats not yours, many kids listened to that in my school but sometimes people just dont care and thats not okay because they might not even need it and just want it. Needing it is like you have to have something or its really important to you and if you dont have it you would have to struggle to find, but if you really need something then I am pretty sure you can buy it from any nearby stores. Wanting something is like you dont have to have it but you just want it to brag or to have fun with it or you just dont really care and dont need it but just want to take something that you can buy, even though your not struggling or going through any trouble you just felt like doing the action you did and dont really care. If you find something dont take it If you see somebody drop something give it back to them Be aware of your actions Dont listen to pear pressure Be helpful Be kind This lesson is very important because many people now dont do this stuff and just take and many parent dont really care anymore so thats when the school has to step in and teach the young kids whats wrong and whats right. When somebody drops something always hand it back why you say, because if you drop something and you think you lost it and it was your favorite toy or a toy that you spent your money on and really liked it, what if somebody just saw it and took it how would you feel, probably mad, sad,upset, you would be very upset because your favorite toy is gone and you cant get it back because the person that took it does not really care and didnt need it but just wanted it or took it because there was nobody there. Now imagine you drop your favorite toy and somebody saw you drop it and ran up to you to give it back to you how would you feel, probably happy, proud, delighted, because that person gave it back and didnt have any intentions with it or didnt think about even taking it they just wanted to give it back because they are not the owners of the item that was found on the ground but the owner that dropped it is right in front of them, the owner of the item could of just walked away and never realized they dropped it until they needed to use it for something. I lost my iPad years ago because the person that saw it took it and didnt really care do I know who it is no because I never payed attention to who took it I just was really happy and didnt realize what they were gonna do, and didnt think of this stuff happening to me when it did happen I was very upset and had to use my moms phone until my dad would buy me a phone. Thats why this lesson is very important to show kids that taking something that isnt yours is not smart or needed, many people dont care but when it happens to them they care and ask there self why did this happen to me is because you didnt leave what you took where it was found so the person that saw the item you own they did the same thing you just did, they took it and you will probably never see it again. Many items are very expensive like phones people love there phones and can never get off it and when somebody cracks there phone they go nuts and get mad because that crack can make your phone glitch or tweak, but if somebody lost there phone I already know that they would be so mad because nowadays phones are over $1,000 and they can be more expensive then that so when they lose there phone and find out somebody took it they wouldnt be very happy and probably go every where to look for it and would do anything to get it back, because phones are so important to people and sometimes they need it for calling somebody to pick them up or they would be stuck at a place for a long time or to call for help if somebody needs it. If somebody stole my phone I would get very angry and sad because the item I just lost and somebody picked it up or stole it is very expensive and isnt easy to buy because new phones are like the cost of a used car that you can buy from the internet.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3105,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Even though some people disagree, I agree with Emersons statement. The world that we live in has always been cruel and it will always be. Growing up in life you will see a lot of people trying to bring you down, do the wrong things and take the wrong path, it is your job to make the right decisions. For example, friends will invite you to do wrong things such as doing drugs, something you are not suppose to do, it will only get you addicted, poor, homeless or all of these combined. They will ask you if you want to try it and they will tell you that it is just for fun and that you will like it, dont listen. You will see people trying to make you do other bad things,even worse then doing drugs, such as stealing from other people, beating somebody up or even killing someone. Be yourself and dont listen to those type of people. Stealing, beating or killing is illegal acts and it will only get you in jail or even maybe killed. Another reason why I agree with Emersons statement is because y ou should stay away from people that doesnt care about their acts,life or future. Dont try doing crazy things just to fit in because someone told you to do it, be yourself, be happy, and people will like you the way you are, they will accept you the way you are, even with all your problems. Forget about what the world wants you to be and focus on yourself so you can be whatever you want to be.

280,3408,87694700310E,"First impressions is always something that i pay attention to when meeting a person for the first time. I will always agree with the fact that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why? imagine meeting a person and the only thing you think about when they cross your mind is the way they first greet you or the way that they introduced themselves to you. For instance, in my opinion, i feel that people will always put on a different character for their ""first impression"". For example, calling a job for a interview is something youd want to change your normal character into a more formal and nice responsible person. You can never change your very first thought of someone, it may change later but not the first second of your conversation. Another example could be is getting someone introduced to you from a friend. On the other hand, theres always an ""i wonder"" question in my mind about everyone, because its totally normal. When meeting someone new there is many of ways people act towards you. They may act shy and make you feel awkward, or they may act friendly and make you feel welcome. So, with that saying, you can never change the way you first think of someone, first impressions will always be a permanent statement that your brain cant erase. Accordingly, if you do have the abilities, you can always tell what type of person they are. With just one impression someone can teach you about themselves a bit, theres no doubt in that. Its fun of how our brains permanently label people from our first impression until it is changed to something else. For example, imagine seeing some person that is always quiet, always seems like their mad or doesnt want to be at the function. What first impression would you get from that person? I would honestly not even bother to talk to them, they could say anything mean to me, But with first impressions changing overtime, you never know once that person starts talking they wont stop smiling or talking. You never know truly about something until you experiment it. In conclusion, the first day of school where you have to introduce yourself, or being at public place and someone asks you for something in a nice way, what do you think about that person? From first impressions, after seeing that person for the second time you would always go back and think about how the first time went. While getting to know them that same thought changes about them because now you truly know who they are. The first times will always be different than the regular times. I will always agree that it is impossible for first impressions to change because of our natural human traits.

281,3409,A8BB150F53AB,"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even its a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasnt made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasnt going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasnt going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time. Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people! Some people dont buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents arent like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, thats why some parents dont let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they dont care whats happens around them. Like my parents didnt want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didnt even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didnt have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they dont have money to eat and they cant help out their children with their eduaction. In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people dont speak your language youll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that dont live with you.

282,3410,F22FE8D7FA16,"Students should commit to a career at a young age?. Many people thing that this would be an advantage in the future, because if many students choose a career when they are young, then theres going to be more professionals that can help the country, but other people thing the opposite, because they thing that the students are not ready to choose a career,because they are not in the age to thing by themselves. In my opinion, I would say that both arguments have good reasons to support their arguments, but l would prefer to be disagree with this opposition. For my first reason, I would say that its too much responsibility for their age, because they dont have the experience necessary to complete a career that they like, but they are not prepare to complete, however if they choose a career, then they have to worried about the college that they want and how much its going to cost to them and their family to start a career, also because they are not going to take the career seriously, and its going to be a waste of time in a career that they can not hold by themselves, so they are going to leave the career. In addition, my second reason is that they dont have the ability to maintain a career mentally, because they can not control their actions and thinking, and if they do things wrong ,and they try to solve their problems alone, its going to be stressful for them, what can cause a distinct kind of future that they dont expect , so they can get affect by all the things that can occur on your way, and also because theres going to be people that instead of help you, its going to use for their benefits, and one example of that is the people who works in factories, construction, and bussines. Finally, my last reason talks about how much time they have to enjoy their life, if they have to work in their career at a young age, because you can choose to be a professional when you are young and find jobs with that kid of career, but if you already know that you are going to work almost the rest of your life to have better future and keep progressing, so why dont enjoy your youth and be happy doing things that you like, instead of worry about find a career that if you are not ready, its going to make you problems that you dont want to have now. In conclusion, supporting with the reasons, I would like to say that the best thing to progress in life, is to find something that your are good, that you can control, and also something that you can make money with that, however if know what you want to do in the future, and you know how you are going to try to make it possible, why dont enjoy what you have now, and leave the occupations for later, so you can concentrate in what you want now, before its start to being late,because life is only one and we have to enjoy the maximum as we can.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that ""sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams""which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong. May not be true for many people but for sure for me,I would agree on it 100% without doughting it at all , its always the ones that have failed and gotten up who would agree on it, it could be tuff for many to accept it but eventually they would agree to it if they were to think about how many times they have failed and won there battled with fighting for it and doing basically what they really want in their life. All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings. However, I have failed so many times and always thought about how i wouldnt make it not even how hard i try to i wasnt gonna make it out of the dark place i was in and eventually i told myself that it was very pointless of even trying anymore if all i was going to do is fail all over again , I didnt have no type of enthusiam whatsoever was horrible and all i did everyday was loss my enthusiam more and more until one day i got back up like a normal day and said to myself that ""Life doesnt get easier you only have to get stronger and i realized so much at that moment i wouldnt even believe myself that i was up like nothing and day ago i was not in the right mindset thinking i was a completely failure and even didnt have enthuasiam for nothing. so last i would agree to the saying of the Former British Prime Minister Winston it made me realize alot and a very true saying of course, ",6,5,5,5,6,5,1689,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
284,3412,E31B2A06C28C,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life, that having a good thinking about what you do, and be proud of it is important. Well, in my opinion it is the only thing, because time is going forward, and not backward, things that you have already done cannot be changed, but by having a good attitude about it you change your future, like being successful in your goals, solve economy issues, and even in day to day life. A positive attitude is really important when it comes to achieve your goals, if you want something but you think you can not make it, it is because you do not have enough attitude, in order to be successful with it, you must forget all the negative thoughts, and believe in yourself, and after all the effort you have been giving you will be a little bit more closer to achieve your goals. Sometimes money can turn your life real hard, it can make you stop trying for what you want, and make you give up; is in this kind of situations when a positive attitude must come in, let me give you a personal experience: I used to live with a stepfather, my mom, and five brothers. At that time bills and debts were easy to pay, my stepfather was making around $3,400 dollars a month, my mom like $1,300 dollars a month, and my brother and I around $800 dollars a month, all these money was the house income, but after my mom and her ex husband divorced, everything changed, now we had all those bills on us, but because we did not give up, and we had a positive attitude about the situation, we started to work even more, now my mom is single, and we can make trough out the month. Another good example is living every day with a positive attitude like at work, at school, at home, even restaurants, it does not matter where you are right now it is important to always have a positive attitude, it is crucial in life to be proud about what you are, where you are, how you are, be the one who makes the change. Some people say that because you did something wrong in the past, it is impossible to make a change about it, but they are wrong because they might not able to change the past, but for sure they can change the future by fixing and understanding in what they have failed, the attitude is important be proud of everything you have done and do not be ashamed. In conclusion, it is really important to have a positive attitude because to be able to achieve your goals you must have to have a positive attitude, money can make it hard for you to live, but you have to think and analyze the situation, wherever you go remember to have a good attitude about yourself, and never be ashamed about something you did wrong remember that you always can make a change, only if you have a positive attitude.",6,6,6,6,5,6,3269,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Enthusiasm is important because is what keeps you doing what you want to accomplish. I strongly agree with the statement of Minister Winston Churchill. I personally think that in life there is always up and downs. For example, when i got bad grades i always think on what am i not doing right so i can fixed it. However, to success in life you have to failure more than once but you have to know that there is going to be obstacles that are going to bring you down but you dont have to let them stop you because you have to think on what you want to accomplish or in what you want to success. If a person losses interest in something they want to, then theyre not going to keeps going. In conclusion, you have to fall so you can get up and keep going to the goal. Loss of enthusiasm can not give you success in life. For example, when you have a goal and there is many obstacles is because your close to get to rich it. However, you can keep doing what you love so you can accomplish the goal that you wanted. Although, there will always be somethimg that try to stop you but you dont have to let stop you. In conclusion, if you dont loss enthusiasm you can do whatever you want. To success in life you have to think positive and act positive in front of anything that want to stop you. Although, you have to show then what you are capable of and what can you became if you dont loss enthusiasm. However, you have to failure so you can have a lesson and you can learn from that lesson.

286,3414,263C2C01BC08,"I disagree with extending the school days, because is too much for the students and teachers, also not fair for teachers to work more them they do, and finally not that good because all the other schools are going to get earlier. Having not much sleep can effect students grades and classwork, This can effect teachers also just like the students. Students wouldnt feel that well with adding one and half hours to school, because they need to study and rest well. Adding all that time to school would effect after school activities, because students would not feel like they had much sleep or they did not study for something that is due for school the next day. Students would not feel well rested because they had to wake up at a early time and then coming back to school, after they come back from school students are looking forward for a nap but they cant because they have chores to do. Another thing is that students would not have time to do their chores that their parents told them to do, because they have homework or have to go to their soccer, swim or gymnastic practice. Adding one and half hours to school would affect the students a lot with activities and school work and also their sleep. One more thing this would effect teachers work because they have to leave school later then before. Also teachers wold not have much time with their family afterwards. Another thing is that teacher are going to have to work even more in their things for the classwork. It would also make it difficult for them because they are going to have to spend more time in school instead with their kids or family.

287,3415,A3E9A1C9917B,"In some areas they have their students pick their career right when they enter high school to help them, but personally that is not a good idea for students. Students may choose a career, and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. Some students might even feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Others may argue and say that having picked a career at that point, and be sure about it may feel that they are ahead of everyone else and prepared for the future. Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. Students may feel overwhelmed, and not like or take serious the career and courses they have. Students may choose a career and later on say they dont like the courses they have to take. They might feel like that is not the correct path for them. Some change their mind because they may feel like the courses are to hard, or that the amount of work is too much. Others may change because their parents might not agree with that career, because its to complicated. Students may not have fully made up their mind yet if they even want to keep studying anything after high school. In addition, if students change their mind once they might keep changing their mind again and again, because they want to experiment other careers and courses. Some students may feel way to much pressure having to pick a career at a young age. Kids may get stressed or even overwhelmed with knowing they have to choose something. As well,some students might already have jobs and it could be tiring. Some students could experience great amounts of anxiety, because they may feel forced to take those courses to succeed later in life. Furthermore, students may not like that feeling when they have to pick and rather give up. Some schools could help pick, but students may not like that and feel more pressure. For example, just having to pick regular classes for the year is somethings to really think about, because you wanna take easy classes but yet succeed as well. Adding on, having to pick your career in even harder and super stressful. Others students might have only picked that career, because their friends have chosen the same career. They might think that its cool and fun, but not realize that it is a bad idea. While they start to spend more time together they could get super annoyed and agitated with one and other. Some of them might have actually like the career they chose and want to do good in the courses they take. In addition, the ones who actually want to take the classes and succeed wont let them if they get annoyed at each other. Teachers and parents may even realize that it wont be a good idea for other peers. In conclusion, having to pick a career to succeed could be stressful. Students might not be able to enjoy their teen years, because they are focused on other things. Other may also agree that being prepared for the future and having plans is a good thing, and young adults can be prepared for it. Other may disagree and say that kids need some freedom and enjoy life as young adults.

In the end of the day it doesnt bother me if they like me or not, because I know they are gonna come back and enjoy the day with me. This first impression thing had me thinking about something that happen a long time ago. Its not based on my experienced, but one my best friends that we go back a long way in middle school. He told me that he didnt like me that much so we didnt talk too much. He didnt even talked to me when we where around each other, but something happen that change our friendship. There was guy who always was there with him the guy had done something terrible and caught suspended for sometime. My friend and I started talking more, after the guy got suspended he told that he didnt like me because I was dating someone he liked thats what happen. My first impressions where good cause everyone that I know are cool with me, but if it wasnt I could of make-up something to be good with them. This thing about first impressions is not that hard to if you have charisma or personality in you. I never had a hard time making friends, because I have personality and charisma this two things you need to have if you wanna be friends with someone or making a first impression. There was a time that I went to talk with my father-in-law that day I was super nervous to even talk to him. In the end my father-in-law was just a great guy we talk about every comment he had to talked. I dont get nervous about nothing, but he was tall and looked like a hard-dude. Even thought I all ready knew him he still looked intimated to look at him. Her wife was the opposite of him she was pollute and nice with me, but I knew that all ready because I seen her in parties.

301,3429,EB5924FBD25C,"Although some say schools shouldnt extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school, actually schools should extend the school day two hours because students get enough time to do their assignments and home works also teachers got enough time to check students work properly and students can add one more subject. Some people say that schools shouldnt extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then lets see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on hes classes? this person is losing 2 things; 1, losing energy 2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it. Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes. Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also its good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another mans treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class. Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.

303,3431,A04B4B412DB3,"The school board should add an hour and a half hours of school to each school day. Do you agree with this? Three reasons why school board should add an hour and a half hours to school are, students wouldnt have much homework, schools could add another elective to the day, and teachers get more teaching time. Help me do this! The first reason why I believe the school board should add an hour and a half hours to the school day is students wouldnt have much homework. Most students have responsibilities after they get home from school. Some have responsibilities at home, work, and sports. Most students take care of their siblings when they get back from school. Others work after school and dont have time to do their homework. Also a huge amount of students have after school sports either inside or outside of the school, sometimes both. The second reason why the school board should add an hour and half hours of school to each day is because schools could add one more elective. Studies show people become disinterested in an activity within an hour. If schools added one more elective to the school day most students would be on board with the hour and a half idea. Some people naturally like school and they want the hour and a half thing to happen. Instead of the elective this class could also be a study time for students that are struggling with a class or an assignment. This could help students grow their brain because they would try to understand it, instead of just giving up. The last reason why an hour and a half hours should be added is teachers would get more teaching time. Teachers tend not to explain some topic well because they run out of time. Students dont ask questions because usually they run out of time. Sometimes the teachers is explaining to another student because they didnt quiet get it either. This doesnt mean the teacher doesnt know how to teach, it means the teacher made an effort to teach as fast as possible so he or she wouldnt run out of time. The school board school board should add one hour and a half hours to each school day. Three reasons why I think this should happen are students wouldnt have much homework. schools could add one more class or elective,and teachers would have more time to teach. Do you agree with me?

304,3432,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us. New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think its also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes. Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation. Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing. My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents wont be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents wont have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that dont they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, thats incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize. Who wouldve known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days? Have you ever experienced or seen a cashier take a billion years just to scan the chicken your considering purchasing? i have and It was devastating to watch! or have you witnessed a wrong change? things like this happen way to often and if you never noticed it on your receipt you just lost some money. Thats why they invented self checkouts to speed up the process of purchasing, thanks to these great machines leaving Walmart was never easier to do. Just scan and go! sooner or later every store in America will have these great machines. Yes theyll once in a while have some bad performance but most of the time there really reliable. Is it weird not seeing a employee in the cash register? yes but youll get use to it as time continues. Having technology in our side has made us better and has lighten our sense of being, technology has been so good to us that it has brought positivists in our lives.

306,3434,6EF7CBB46501,"The statement that the author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about to do something else just to be someone in the world, it is completely an error. I disagree with this statement, since, I believe that every person think differently. For example, people has their own ideas and ways how to do their own business. Everyone can make a biggest impact in the world, but, by doing what they love. Not what others think that it could be beneficial for you. To be someone in a world you should believe in yourself, make right decisions, and success. First of all, people could enter in your mind by telling you what could be beneficial for your life or carer. Some of them accept their opinion and do what they do not like, or love. For example, when students are thinking in what career they want to study. Parents influence in their choices by telling about what career would be properly for them. However, those ""properly careers"" it is not in their list of careers they want to study. This action make some teenangers to take that step of let parents choice by themselves. Otherwise, they do not help them to mature or even take responsabilities. Everyone should believe in themselves by doing whatever they love, without any interpose in accomplish their dreams. Since, we have the right to build them, it does not matter if we commit an error. Because of our capacities to avoid them or even get over it and keep going. People has the right to make big choices in life. Making decisions it is hard and important because it could be beneficial, or even worst. However, if you choice with your heart it might be right but by the time you can change your mind. But, you wont regret it about those decisions because as they say, ""You have to learn for every error you commit to be success."" This means that we learn through the past of the time every fall, because you have to stand up and continue your life. It helps us to growing our knowledge to build a better version of ourselves. Finally, by being confidence to yourself helps you to surpass any obstacle. Beliving in your ideas and trying to make it come true, it tells us that you are persist person chasing for your dreams. Which is quite favorable for person in any career or even job. Because of seeking to be successful at your own way, by do not depend about what others can say. Everyone has a differently perspective than others by doing what you love without any ""obligation"" or to be oppresed. In conclusion, I am not accorded by this statement, since, we have different points of view. However, I believe that every human being can make their dreams come true without any oppression by others. People should stand by themselves by starting to be confidence in their belief.

308,3436,9EAB766AF4BE,Students and teachers have important roles in their life. The students need to pass the class in order to graduate and the teacher gets paid for doing his/her job. As long as the kids are not failing teacher has the job it is very key that students and teachers should be having good relationship. If the student ever needs help he or she can feel comfortable talking to the teacher and the teacher should be helping the students. If they need it because they can loose their job. Lets say if the students decide to design the project there own. The only problem with that its going to be to easy for them. Also it wont challenge them so there brain will not learn anything and it will be useless. If it was a group project most of the kids would go with the smart people so they can finish it. And not worry about it and some of the lazy kids will cheat on the projects. If i was the parents i would tell them do it yourself and learn how to finish the project the right way and get a good grade. Having the teacher design the project is way smarter. They will know what kind of project to create. And also if this was a group project it will be smart for the teacher to put some kids in the group because then the teacher can decide how many points it can be. And how long they have to finish plus the students dont do anything in there break myself being a student i can relate to that. But they have to learn something so when they do start school they will be one step of ahead of everyone. My personal opinion is that i probably wont do the assignment during break right away but i will finish before it ends whenever i have the time. At the end of the day both teachers and students are trying to help each other out. And i think its more productive the teacher designs the project because when the teacher grades them or goes over them teacher can give feedback. Thats very important see what parts you did wrong or where you did good at. Having feedback can help you a lot but staying with the teacher to design the project is the best idea. Because the students can learn more and get more information on there project. And they will get good grades on them and it should be required to have teachers designing projects for the students.,7,6,6,6,7,7,2117,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
309,3437,1BD023792E29,"In my point of view, I feel what is more beneficical is working alone. You might think working in a group is more beneficial, but let me tell you why is it not a good idea. It lets you concerate more on your work and wont let you get distracted and get off topic with the rest of the group. On top of that it gives you the chance to slightly get your work done in a matter of time. On the other hand, in case you dont understand a topic,it benefits you learning alone so next time you understand it in the future time. In this way of working alone, has many benefits and could help you in many ways in the long run. Have you ever been part of a group at somepoint in your life, and your group gets off topic and ends up not finishing the work that was assigned? It really isnt such a productive group like that I could say. Say perhaps you were trying to get your work done, but you entire group wants to do unproductive things and gtet off topic. Have you ever thought who gets the blame after? Your group gets the blame and you as well. Even if you were being on topic and getting your assignment done, but your also part of the group, what could you do. Let me give you an example. There was once where my math teacher said we could work in a group. Me and my group were getting our work done, until one of my group members gets off topic. There goes my whole group off topic. What was the result after, my group didnt finish the assignment. Next thing you know who got the blame that day. My whole group and including me as well. I explained to my math teacher in a nice, clamy matter to her, that I was trying to get my work done, she didnt lose an energy listening to me. What if you teacher for example set a timing to finish the project, and you couldnt finish in time because of the silliness in your group? Im positive you would want to finish in time and get a good grade. Im more than certain that you dont want to finish late with your group and get a zero as your grade from your teacher. Ive have so many examples, but let me tell you one that stood up to me and left my eyes bright open. My biology teacher had told the whole entire class there was a project due at the end of the class. So she told us to get in groups, of four people in the group. Long short story, my group got way off topic and didnt finish in time. At the end,we all got zeros and for a week I had a zero bringing my grade down. I brought my grade up, until it was test day. Ive been through so many experiences, I enjoy working alone. On the other hand, I also experienced understanding a topic on my own, which feels great let me tell you. Have you ever experienced in life going or thinking of a topic and not understanding? That has happened to me once. Where your at a point,where you dont understand a topic, but learning on your own kicks in. Everytime you go back and reazlied what you did wrong, it all kicks in, in the future. Which in my point of view is a good benefit. Learning on your own is denfitnely not a bad thing. There was once where I was having quite the trouble at a topic, in my class of english, but the outcome wasnt so bad. As I could say. In that certain assignment I got a high B. I learned after where I needed more information on that topic in my english class. On the next assignement I had I got a high A. Working alone has many benefits and could benefit you in the long run. Many poeople think its beneficial working in a group, but I say no. Want to do better, get a good result after, get a nice dencent grade after. Working alone is the solution. Dont let anyone trick you into saying its bad, because it is most ctertainly not a bad choice/idea. If you come across a point to work in a group, thats great, im not saying never work in a group. Although at some points when the stitution is series to get an assignment done, thats were working alone comnes in handy.",7,8,8,7,9,9,366,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
310,3438,0B00BC4CBABC,"So if it has come to a point that you dont have to make decisions on your own, even if you have what ever it takes to rule the whole nations, what would you do?. Nothing?, or run away to where you can make your own plans?. NO!. I strongly agree that, people should make decisions on their own. Making decisions on your own can make you stronger. For example, when i realize i was failing my science class. I took a decision on my own by telling myself; i need to pass this class for the rest of the quarter. And im doing great now because i put in my mind with all my strength, focused and im doing more than amazing. If someone gave me that decision to pass that class, i wouldnt be able to, because i havent made my mind up to that and maybe i dont or not into that class. Secondly, you know your challenges to your decision that you make by yourself. For instance, i tried out this year for the school soccer team. I knew it was only 2 option: either you make it or you get cut out. So, me knowing that made me work harder when i get on the pitch. I get pains in my legs when i get home but i also know that, i have do it again tomorrow so it makes me do extra work home so that i wont be ill but be in shape for the next day. Lastly, sometimes we make a bad decision which help us learn. To prove this, 3 weeks ago, my mom ask me to clean her bathroom for her, also i had a club to attend. Because i knew going to club will be fun and meeting new friends so, i told my mom im going to the club instead, and i will clean the bathroom the next day. And so, i went to the party. A friend of mine was a drug dealer: i didnt know, and he was wanted my the police. He came to the same party and we were sharing the same table. We were drinking, chatting, eating and having fun. All of a sudden, we saw 3 police men that came to arrest my friend but because we were sitting together; we were all arrested because him. If i choose to clean the bathroom this would have not happen to me. The lesson that i learned is that; i dont need to follow my decision every time, and also know who hang around with. As a results, making decisions on our own can make us strong and focused, know our challenges and also learn. If all this ability only get reviewed when we make decisions on our own, why should we seek for guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters?. Lets people take decisions and do stuff with their own mind set.",7,6,7,7,7,6,146,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

312,3440,DE0F5C13960F,"Have you ever wondered what it is like to have a homework club at your school, well its pretty useful. The idea is for kids to do their homework at school instead of at home, you can get help from a teacher and also work with your buddies. One reason why I argue for school clubs to be available is because you it gives you time to do other stuff such as, spending time with your family,spending time with your friends,and even go to the movies. If you do your homework at the homework club you wont have to worry about due dates, quizzes, or tests. If you dont go the homework club you will always have tons of homework and not even do it which can cause your grades to fall down and probably not graduate if the required skills arent meet. Secondly, if you and your friend are in the same class and get the same homework then you can work on it together,check each others papers, and quiz each other on it. If you work on it alone you might get confused and frustrated, or maybe stressed, obviously copying one another does not make you learn anything, but there is a teacher who can help both of you at the same time. Video games are very fun and addictive but you cant play if you got homework in the way. If you get you homework done then you have the whole day to play with your friends, communicate with them and even battle to the lat one standing. Some video games have blood, gore, and violence and some kids love those games which can be a small problem but not a big one, most parents can take devices and electronics away because kids dont do their homework so if you want to play video games and have fun you better go to homework club. In conclusion the homework club should be available and going so that kids can finish their homework all at once and have fun in and out of school. Homework is really important and kids very often dont do their homework and thats probably the reason why kids hate school and do not want to got to school.

313,3441,D0D7C3A056CE,"Should people make their own decision ? or should people seek for guidance ? I think you should live your life the way you want to live it with the guidance of your parents because they already lived theirs. Our parents have experienced life and its challenges and which they would want the best for us and nothing else. For example you are looking to purchase a car, you would ask your parents for their thoughts and guidance because they have already been there done that. Deciding what you would want to be in life, Now thats a choice you choose on your own, you choose if you want to be successful in life, you choose if you wanna have a big house, a nice car, a good job thats all you from what ive learn in life is that nothing is gonna be done by its self. You are not gonna get what you want if you dont get up and handle it yourself. I look up to my older brother because he moved out with a goal and that goal was to own his own car, his own apartment by the age of twenty one and still going to school part time. I aspire to be like him so hard working and with a goal to do it all by himself with the guidance of my parents of course. But thats not the point, the point is that he left my parents house with a goal, determination, and self trust he always told me that its all about taking risky decisions in life. Nobody cant make you do anything but yourself the only person that can harm you is yourself the decisions you make in life will impact yourself. You decide what is right or wrong in the real world because outside of high school its a whole different ball game you are gonna make bad decisions and good decisions but its okay mistakes will happen and mistakes are good because you will be able to learn from them and grow as a whole. i think mistakes are a blessing because i know that my parents both made mistakes and some a regretful and some are a blessing that you will learn and live to tell on. I think its important to have something or someone to inspire you to motivate you have to trust your own gut because you can always look up to them. Or be someone a person can look up too, be motivation for someone else be someone you want to be in life. But its not just gonna be handed to you you have to work for it there are always gonna be obsticals in the way or challenges in the way but you have to tell your self to just keep swimming.

314,3442,E8795A1AA404,"When making life decisions it is good to ask someone for help then making the desicison yourself. Why is it better asking someone about the decision is because they could tell you either the desicison is good or they could tell you that dont do it and try to find a better idea. When making a life decision you have to think about the importance, how much it would cost me or whats the overall budget, and how its going to help me achieve in life. When making life decisions it really matters on how its important to you or how its going to effect you in life. As life goes on do I think its going to help me improve what Im doing right now or is it going to drop me and destroy me for life. When making life decisions it also depends on how youre looking at that particular thing/object. Thats why you should ask someone else who is already doing that particular thing from before or ask someone who could give you an personal opinion/advice that would actually make you think if making this life decision is worth it or not. When buying something big that will have a effect on my life i would have think about my budget and how am I going to afford this project without having any issues. So to do that I would ask someone for advice who is already doing that business or investment. When asking others for advice I would have to think about how theyre going to respond and what theyre going to say. This is why budget is also a very big thing when it comes to making life decisions is because I would have to pay that amount in order to have my business or investment stand out out the people around me. Why would I have to ask someone to achieve my investment or business. To achieve my business i would have to ask someone for a advice who is already doing something similar to that. As Im asking for the opinion or the advice i would have to think how or what Im going to do to improve that decision. What hard work or thinking of mine or someone elses would have to go in that play to achieve the decision. As I would be achieving the decision I would have to see how Im being affected with it and how much pressure its putting on me. Why would I ask others for advice when I have brain and thats because theyre going to have a different mind set from me. They probably think better than me or in some way where we both agree on the same fact to achieve the business or investment in a better way. This is why you should ask someone else for a advice or a opinion than going in alone in such a big decision that could impact your life in less than some days. In conclusion to making life decisions it is a good idea to ask someone else for a advice than making the move alone. Its because someone else has a different mind set than you yourself. Thats why when making a life decision you should think about what things and what mind set you need to proceed with your investment or business. So the mains things you need is how important the investment or business is to me, How high or low my budget is, and what will I have to do to achieve this business/investment. For all these reasons you should always ask a person about their advice or opinion even though I might not listen to it but it doesnt hurt to ask. Theyll give me the best advice or opinion even how big or little the investment/business is.",6,5,7,7,6,7,3368,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
315,3443,A1CA2A691C98,"Do I agree or disagree on Ralph Waldo statement well I agree on what he is trying to say because you can master beyond something and get somewhere in life. Also following your dreams and do what you want to do. Try not to follow anyones decisions they make for you because its not right for them to do so. Its your path to choose what you have set in life. You can master things in life if you believe in yourself and never give up. But people can tell you that you arent too good for things and you should give up on everything. If you were to master something important you will get somewhere in life. It can start by graduating from any school. If you mastered graduating from school it can get you a new job where you can do something better and you can grow from it. Also you can be willing of having a family , that for me its a huge thing to have because they will help you get better opportunities. However mastering what you can it can take you to places and you can improve to becoming something better. Trying your hardest is a big key note because if you dont you may never get to become what you want and you may never grow from it. What do I want to do and should I follow my dreams or goals. By following what you want to do you can become the next big singer out there. If you want to achieve something no one believed you can do you can become the next president. Also by thinking out of the box it can make you do things you have always wanted to do. However if you believe in yourself you can be a professional soccer player without being so ostentatious. But people can bring you down and you can always bring yourself back up if you believe that you can do it. How can I not try to follow anybodies decisions they make for me. Well you always have to make sure that things are about you even if you dont want it to be about you. People can make you do things so you can give up on something you set you goal on. Dont listen to what they say or on what they want to tell you. Its not good for you to have negativity around you. Also you have to efface on what people have to say about what you do or how you are going to do it . However make your mark and show them what you can achieve and make the people who believed in you proud that you did it. When someone has something so positive to say that can change someones thinking I have to agree to what he or she has to say and its true we do have to master beyond something or we will never grow. To never give up on following your dreams and what you have set your goals for . Also try not to listen or follow what anyone decides for you and try to make it about what you want it to be . If you mastered that goal by you having them set then you will be going to places and having great opportunities. Its hard if you dont do things you have set your mind to because you will go nowhere.

318,3446,B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone youre not. You wont have to meet some jobs perspectives. You wont have to be someone youre not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life. The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some jobs ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they dont like the response. But, there are some jobs that will accept you and will like who you are truly. Second of all dont have to be someone youre not. You shouldnt have to please others only because they dont like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isnt. You shouldnt have to be the opposite of who you are just so you dont get judged on. Pay no attention to those who dont accept you for being nothing but yourself, and dont change for them unless youre doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what. Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you cant even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world wants them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more.

Success is necessary consists of going from failure because failure teach us how to be better and create responsibility. First, failure teach us how to be better, for example if I did a song to someone important to see and this person didnt like it; I wont give up even if is the worse song ever because the failure will show how to learn better and if you wont give up and always try the best you will get the success.

Next, failure make you create responsibility, for example if you are a failure on something and want to be better, you always will try something new to get better and try your best, thats mean responsibility to yourself, for example if I want to get my drive license and I fell many times, I can be a failure on it, but if I create responsibility and study every day I will do good and pass with success. If I speak another language and my English is a failure I will be responsive and study to understand the people and do well on my classes. As you can see, always have a way, we learn with failure to be better then you were On the another hand, some people believe we never have to have failure in our success, because failure can a negative in your life and in your life you always have to be have to be positive; this point make sense, but in life we always have to learn something. Therefore this statement is right because success consist of going from failure.

Some of the ideas are very difficult to reach the goal, but it is passable to think together and make it happen. Team work to win the competition is to work together.

There ill be some difficult times where you will want to give up in life times where you will feel like you just cant do it anymore, but students struggle with their own personal problems but they can get through it all and that is what makes the build-up self-confidence about the risk and task they make in life.",5,5,7,6,5,7,1537,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
323,3451,D579D6F26A91,"Have you ever wondered if you have extracurricular activities are getting in the way of your homework time or study time and if the activities you take should be up to the school or the student and his or her family? Im going to explain why I believe the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers. My first reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because capable on choicen activities that would like to take and enjoy. For example if the school choices classes that you dislike and not enjoy you would have to be stuck with it. Also you would be very stressed that youre in that class and that stress can affect other classes in a negative way. My second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because idf students choose to do more activities they gain more expirence in diffrent types catagories. This is a good thing beause it allows students to test the waters and find out what thy like to do so they can think about studying in college and persuing it. For example if you have more activities you have a way better chance to find something you like than less activies. However, the school might say that if a student has more extracurricular activities it would affect the time students has for doing homework and studying. They also might say they know more about time managment but some students are fast at doing homework and are very fast at studying. So I think that the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers. The family and the student should know if they are capable to have many activities and still get their work done. That is why I believe the student should choose if they want to do many or little extracurricular activities.

One reason that I think that is best to change the school lunch menu is that it could eliminate bad eating habits. Students can learn to eat without being tempted to eat junk food at school. Another reason on how you can switch the food is by substituting the schools junk food by exchanging it with something much more tasty and nutritious food that could lead into healthy eating routine to all the students. Some students say that they disagree on changing the school lunch menu. If were to eliminate students favorite school lunch meals; it could lead to them not to eat or buying junk food outside of school. However school lunch teachers are preparing tasty, and nutritious lunch ideas to serve to their students. Eating a nutritional diet could increase focus in class, increase lifespan, and minimize harmful toxins and bacteria to the body.

325,3453,ADFE2CDB6FF1,"Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus. -The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, "" the intelligent student told me that i cant do anything or i cant speak very well English"" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school. -For example: If a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself. Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting. Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. Below for those students that dont like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. i know that because a friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her I dont know how hard it is, but i can imagine in this position. So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didnt feel ok for leave her baby at home. This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school. I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home thats great idea. but there are many problems; what happen if the student do not have money to pay the online classes? either their families do not have the recourses for help them another reason thats why we have to work and make money for us and we missing many days in the school for stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we coming to the school and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So i think this if a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day dont and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary ""NEVER GIVE UP"" when we want something that we cant get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it. During school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are: - Spend more time in the computer - More focus in the homework - Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want - Study all the day - No talk with your friends during your class - Finish more fast with no distraction All that things are benfit if the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they dont have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes is appropriate for school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood for study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Many student suffer of depreciation and that is so bad for them. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home.

I disagree that school should be more than eight hours because teachers can not manage their time, all staff will get tired, and some student have to take care of their family. Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he wont be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job. On the other hand, most teachers have kids and they send kids to baby care and they pay money. For example, my science teacher Generic_Name she was not able to stay after school because she has kids. Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy? All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half. My cousin told me I have hard time to understand the teacher on the end of the class because he get tired. Some Student have to take care about their family. For example, When I came from Iraq my mother had heart problem so I have to take care of her each day. My mother she was not able to cook and stand I was responsible to do that. However, when I was in my country I was responsible about my nephews as well. Some say extending school hours is hopeful for student. They are wrong because some student dont like school so they will drop out. Some say student will have finish the school early. They are wrong student will be rushing and not able to get the lesson from first time. Positives. Negatives.

327,3455,E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on peoples lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient. One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPads to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work. Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information. Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipments and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world. Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it. Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on peoples lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

For example doing something that i might regret doing or not thinking positively before doing something also scared of not being to reach my goal in life. Second reason of why i do agree is because when you have that feeling that you feel good and confident about yourself you just know your doing great but then something inside you just wants to give up and throw everything away. Third reason i feel like if i stay int the same bubble i will never grow out of it by being scared and not having positive feelings towards me. I just think it isnt easy as it looks to loose something and seeing the you wont grow from it. Lots of people make mistakes that they regret and they wanna change that but they cant its to late but its never to late to try all over again until you grow out of that spot. people just think giving up on things you like doing is easy to forget but it s not because thats something you love doing and youve mastered doing in all your life youve kept that postive view in your mind people just give up when they realize that they cant continue thats how you will never grow by giving up its hard to when you come to a point that you commited a bad thing and you regret doing you cant take it back but life is also giving us the chance to improve and forget about everything and continue to grow bigger from that small place you feel inside you never give up on anything just continue on what you feel confident on doingand be happy.

Due to the fact that your actions speak louder than words is true. Your actions are things you can not change from your first impressions. When you start to act in front of somebody you just met, do not be mean or rude to them. If you do that they will think you are not a good person to be around.

332,3460,F530741D2297,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing."" Jeffersons quote is accurate because we can not accomplish something without doing something in life. Everyone has a goal in life; to meet those goals we have to prepare and take steps to complete them. Some people may say that inactivity can also serve a purpose because there are people, including: famous people, family members, or teachers who has once been passionate about something they have done in their lives who quit and became someone bigger, but they are wrong. There is a lot that can be done and steps to take if we are always doing something for ourselves or for others because instead of doing nothing we can focus on our education to help us in the future or to make this world a better and wonderful place for everyone. For starters, when students focus on their education all the time there is a lot that can be done. One reason why students can do so much with our education is because often education can prepare us for a big exams. For example, in class students are learning and reviewing different tropics repeatedly, which will help us pass any exams that will be given to us. This proves that when students are constantly learning something they can accomplish anything that they were leaning or reviewing throughout the year. This shows students how much they have done by focusing, instead of doing nothing. Another reason why students can do so much with their education is because it can help them graduate and accomplish bigger things in life. For example, most students that are always on task and doing everything that they should be doing have bigger plans in life than those who do not. This proves that students that accomplish more by being on task with their education will graduate with a future ahead of them. As a result, students that are focus and on task are more likely to feel incredible for everything they have accomplished in their education. Second, a lot of people around the world can do so much to help other communities by volunteering and to make this world a better place. A reason why it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something is because we can help those around us. For instances, there is a lot of people around the world that need our help, such as homeless people or families who live poor. We as a community can feed those who are homeless or can help families who need help with jobs or to get health insurance. This shows, that if we gather together as a group we can see how much we have done to help these people in need. Another reason to see how much we can do together is by making great choices in life. For example, we can plant fruits and vegetables and give them out for free to help people around us to consider to make better food choices. As a result, there is many opportunities we can take to make this world become a better place for everyone. We can only accomplish a lot by doing everything in our power to make better this world a better place. In Jeffersons quote, he was saying that we can do so much by doing something and it is true. If we put our mind into something and do everything we can to accomplish what we have in mind we can do anything, but if we just sit there doing nothing, we will not have the outcome we expected to want. Everyone lives in different ways, but it is important to see what each of us individuals can accomplish in life. The only way we can graduate is by focusing and staying on task. Some may see the see the world as being lazy, but we can change that by helping out and planning something together as a group to make a change in the world. It is important that we are making a change for ourselves and our communities. These are some reason why we should always do something to get the outcome that we want to see.",8,9,9,8,8,9,3643,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

338,3466,D3A6B04B54A9,"Should school have a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall? People said most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Some people argue that there should be year round schools, where there would be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. However I believe that students should have a longer summer break because a long summer break will give the student time to travel, spend time with their family, and work in summer. The first thing you can do by having a long summer break is travel overseas without worried about how many day you can stay. By travel overseas you need time to explore the country go around the city, and enjoy yourself. Cause travel in a different country you can learn new thing that you never learn anywhere, or experience the thing that you learn in school like go to a history site that you learn from history class. Traveling is not all about playing around didnt learn anything, but you can have your choose of where you want to go, and what you want to do. There are one type of travel that I think is really good for student that theyre going to have fun, experience, and still learning. Its the tour during summer break with your teacher, and your schoolmate. Its recommend by school where you can come to a country that you learn about their language, and culture in school. There are a lot of different thing that you need to get ready to go to another country, so you cant get everything done in a week of spring break. The second thing you can do by have a long summer break are spend time with your family, and friends. When summer come you, and your friends plan to go on vacation together because all of you have the same summer time even if yall come from a different school. Because all the schools doesnt have a same winter break, or spring break that is the reason why you, and your friends cant go to vacation together. Family is the most important thing for everybody. On summer you can spend more time with your family, or go visit cousin. Summer are the students break, but their parent still have go to work. The 3-4 week summer break is too short for students to have a chance spend time with their family. For overseas students that even worse theyre study in a year, but still dont has a chance to come back to see their family just because the short amount of time that they have for break. The third problem is the student work on summer break most student are get their job during the summer. Because with the amount of time you available to work for them, they will hire you. For a student work in the summer is the best choose when you work on summer you can save a big amount of money to use during the year, and dont have to go work during school year, so you can be more focus in school. With a week off in winter break, or spring break you cant find a job because the short amount of time. Some people say their should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and week off spring and fall. Its will help the student return to school without forgot everything that they have been learn. However I disagree with this idea I believe there should be a long summer break by that student can do what they want, and still learning new thing. I think a long summer break is the best time in a year for students travel overseas to study in the United State like me. Because this is the only time in the year we can come back to the motherland to meet us family, and visit cousin. During school year we cant come back to our country to celebrate holiday like Christmas, or mother day...etc. We have to celebrate a lone because the limit of the time wont let us make it home. A long summer break will help the student overseas spend more time with family because there are enough time for them to get ready, and travel a long way home. For students that live in United State you can go travel with your family to make more memory. When students have enough time to enjoy them self in summer it will help them return for school in a exciting way, so they can learn faster.

340,3468,2F268BE28055,"Failure plays an important part in your life and it also lead you to success. why would many people thinks that failure lead you to success?. Well failure is one of the things that help you look back at yourself, so that you can start asking yourself questions that matters and that will help you succeed. You cannot survive in this world without you failing, or you having some kind of trouble that want to make you give up. The reasons why I agree with Churchills statement is, because school, parents, and your career are things that help and give you hope, so that you can succeed. The first things that plays an important part and you need in life is Education. School teach you things the hard ways and by you learning it the hard ways, help you fix your mistake in a better way. Your school work is what going to lead you to your success and your next journey in life. Without your education, it will be hard for you to succeed, or to even think about what kind of experience you couldve have and what kind of person you couldve been. You failing is teaching you how life is, what your next journey can be, and how much effort that you going to put into it. For you to succeed you have to fail, so that you can actually grow up, learn how life goes, and learn from your mistake. Education help you succeed in a better, clean, and a proper way. The second thing thats important and that you need in your life is your parents. They advise you of how they were able to succeed, have a family, and how failing is a bless, because you get to learn from that. Your parents support you in the good moments and also in the bad moments. It is when other people are supporting and giving you advice other than your parents, because you going to have to choose if it a good advice or a bad one. That is why when you happen to have any of your parent supporting you, or giving you advice, you should be greatful. Some teenagers loose hope and their confident when theyre failing, because they have no support, no one to give them advice, and theyre lonely with no parents. That is also why your parents play an important role on your success even though, you keep failing. The third thing that helps you see things clearly and that challenge you, is your career. when you have a career, or want to have a career, it is where you going to start making mistakes. By you having a good career and want to keep it, but you keep failing actually help you learn how to succeed. You having a job helps express yourself, more mature, and it help you learn how to challenge yourself, so by you doing that, leads you to success. You challenging yourself, help you see a better and a more challenging person. Your career help you stand up for your mistake, challenge yourself, and fix your mistake. Most people would think that failure leads you to success and fewer people would think that failure leads you to giving up. ""Success consist of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm."" They might think that it is peoples opinion, because why go to school when you can succeed the dirty way. What these people think is that their succeeding, but what they dont know is that their keep failing over and over again. Playing it the dirty way is not you succeeding, but it is you proving to yourself that you keep failing. That is why failure play an important role in pursuing your success. I agreed with Winston Churchill, because success does consist of you failing. The reasons why I agreed with Winston Churchill is, because Education, parents and career are important things and people that helps you succeed. By you failing thesempeople and things are the ones giving you advice and help you be more self assured. Everyday in this life youre challenging yourself with new things and these things, are things that you need to keep doing, so that you can succeed. You will never be successful unless, you failed.

341,3469,D36CCF111F86,"A positive attitude is more helpful to others and motivational,But ones attitude dose not necessarily have to be positive in order to succeed. Ones attitude can be either positive or negative as long as it improves ones ability to succeed. There are many keys to success but attitude is a major key , because attitude introduces or rather shows character. A positive attitude is a great thin but ones attitude can be negative ,but it is more over whelming to others and some might not either like or no longer associate with that person. As long as that attitude helps with your success it should not matter what type of attitude youve got. Ones attitude is ones guide as it allows more options to come ones way. In a way attitude can guide and help ones path to success or it could close all the doors to ones dreams and success. On the side of a beneficial attitude; people can really catch the feeling of your attitude. What that means is if the attitude is negative but it gets things done then it should not matter as long as it benefits the amount of work or what ever is being or getting done. A positive attitude is more or rather feels more rewarding that much of a negative attitude. A positive attitude is more rewarding and dose allow the people getting that attitude to feel more successful and more appreciated. Although a positive attitude is more beneficial it can lead into less work or less progess being made and shows that one is not trying hard enough to succeed. By having a negative attitude your showing to others that your work matters. And by doing so you can encourage others or rather inspire others have have a good work ethic by tring your hardeste even if some one is pushing you to work in a negative way. Success come to ones mind and it over comes everything if they put their minds to it. Yes attitude is a key to success, but it dose not have to be positive if its beneficial to one in their path of success. I do believe that a positive attitude is more appreciated but a negative attitude is less appealing. I feel as long as your attitude is improving your work ethic and it benefits your progress then is should not matter wether or not its positive or negative as long as you have the right mind set you should have a successful work ethic. Your attitude reflect on your work it just depends on how you use your attitude in your work. for example if my boss came in yelling at me saying "" get to work your not getting paid for nothing."" thats a negative attitude so thats going to make me have a negative mind but if i can use that frustration and negativity to inspire e to do my work I will notice that all I have to do is do my work and my bosses attitude will change one me. But if my boss were to have a positive attitude then I could also use that as a motivation as it not only shows me that my boss likes that I do my work but it shows me that im appreciated. I can see that having a positive attitude is more motivational, but ones attitude can be negative as long as it benefits you and others in a positive way. people need to understand that they can use these attitude to benefit themselves. Peoples attitudes are what helps people succeed as it should motivate and help make their attitude more positive through the day knowing you did good enough to improve your self. Attitude is much more than just success, its the key to motivation.",7,8,8,7,8,6,2939,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
342,3470,94EC7DF6EA74,"People these days dont go outdoors as much as they used to. I think that many people are avoiding going outside, because of cell phones. going outdoors is actually more fun than staying indoors doing nothing, because you can do a lot of activities. Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities. People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music.

Riding your bike can actually help you later in life, because it can give you stronger bones and can improve your stamina and strength. Another thing that you can do is play outdoor games, such as tag, freeze tag, and hide and go seek tag, but there is many more. These outdoor games can also improve your stamina and strength.

343,3471,3691B4714FD5,"Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some bussineses are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I belive that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn farter, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving. Almost every student loves to have a loger weekend, one example could be my neightbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wish to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay loger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually. The second reason, which is so important for students, I belive it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicklier,Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, ""Generic_Name study, do your homework,"" and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I belive Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the loger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some wird liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my theacher, Generic_Name, says, ""it would be greatful, if we would have more time so we would be able to finish the experiments,"" and of course! the entire classe agree with what he says. Some people might say that students would forget somethings during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air polution in this world, and one of the biggest is fosil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would casue a great impact over the polution, it could reduce polution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes friday could help to save that much resources. As a conclusion, I belive schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I belive the most important, society will have less air polution, and also the the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day schoool.",8,7,8,7,7,6,710,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

So you can not change it because that is what you felt at the moment when you experienced this feeling in your life and you will not want to change it because you liked what you felt and you might probably want to repeat it again. Then it is like when you see someone on the street or in the city that is wearing completely different clothe or extrange clothes than you or than everybody around you, and he or she inmediatly is catching everybodys attention, because probably they never have seen someone like them before or they not normally used to see people wearin like that. Sometimes people might probably start talking about them like given own opinions, or some people just judge them because of their dreasing, others just are corious because they might probably want to know something about this people because they or their culture seem interested to them and the want to experience sort of activities with this people or have fun with them.

Every individual should have faith, in order to conquer challenges. Failing is just a word, it cant do nothing to stop a person to keep trying to pursue its goals. Failing for me doesnt mean its the end. Its a good experience, because it teaches lessons.

Our worlds one of the brilliant scientist of all time Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I think that imagination is more important than knowledge in a lot of ways. ""Imagination"" is the power of mind to make something creative. Sometimes when you imagine something that you know you will do it no matter who stops you, It may come to real life and change the whole world. It can change a lot of thing in the world that you didnt thought of. For example: think that you designed a machine from your imagination about a robot maid who can help you to clean your house , do your laundry, make you dinner, washing the dishes, etc. From your idea, you made the robot and It worked just the you wanted it to work. And then your robot went to the market and the people brought it and loved the machine. How would you feel when you see your robot went viral in the world and people liking it? Your robot machine went from an a imaging thing to a big successful robot machine. Also It helps your mind get stronger.

Next, you will give them some helpful advises that will make them better. If they feel safe around you, they will be more comfortable to tell more about them in future.

A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves. Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision. Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach. Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong. Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Names parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions. In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do.

If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isnt much people to do that.

350,3478,9EC4A16802BF,"I believe music, drama, or art class should be classified as electives because some students might not be interested in these classes due to them are wanting to learn more about other subjects, consequently failing; furthermore, students may also have an interest in a certain job and do not need these classes, students can also find these classes a waste of time because they are learning a subject that is not aiding their future, students would also not take these classes serious because they are not necessarily an essential. First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class. Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills. Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects. In conclusion, I believe music, drama, and art should classify as an elective because students may find that the class is not of interest to them, students can also have an interest in a certain job, and some students would not take these classes serious and take it as an opportunity to horseplay.

351,3479,EB03C897F7E8,"Student and teachers are have opposing views on working together for various reasons. However, according to new Stanford research, when people are treated as partners working together their motivation, student are able to communicate with each other, therefore creating a better final product. Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone. Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working ""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new ideas. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity. Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes. Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group. if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others. working in a group is also good for getting other peoples opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement. Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated.

352,3480,8281058A7684,"Ralph Waldo once wrote,""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow.""I agree with this quote because of my experience learning another language like English it can be hard to learn English coming from a Hispanic family,and video gaming. Some may disagree with the quote because there is nothing else to learn . When I was in first grade I came to school not knowing any English. Honestly I felt isolated because the language barrier I did not know what the teacher was telling me. All I said was ""Yes"" and ""No"" thats all I knew. I think it was a few weeks later that they call my parents . They notify my parents that I was not doing well in school. My mother as always told me practice makes perfect. My mother with little bit of English that she knew she helped me to perfect it. Now, I could speak both languages fluently because of that effort I have more opportunities for a better job . In Christmas the year 2017, I got the probably the best and worst gift of my life. It was an X box one at first felt happy because it was my second gaming console, but I did not know how to use it. It took me two weeks to understand the full operation. Then when I starting playing the first game that I bought was Fifa 18 by the way I did not pay for the game it was my dads credit card. After that I downloaded Fortnite it was free so I didnt get in trouble . I found the games difficult , I started to practice a lot , then a few weeks later it became an addiction. I couldnt focus in school my grades were falling off where I had them before I got the X box one. My father told me if I did not get better grades he be forced to take away . So I started to focus on my grades ,but yet still thought the gaming console . Some may disagree that what Ralph Waldo wrote. For example, if youre a teacher you probably know what to teach for the semester. The job you have does not require that much only a master degree. Or being a car washer you just clean cars.

353,3481,5CF895003869,"""Unless you try something beyond what you already mastered,you will never grow"" I agree with this argument because if people never try something new,they will never know if they choose the best option because never try. In my opinion be afraid is the worse thing in the world. In my experience afraid is the most thing that I feel stoped me because if I am afraid I never try something beyond things I have,even knowing that it can be better for me. Also if people try to do something new,they will learn more things than they already know. Keeping trying is the best option for all people in the world. Does not matter if they fail or they are wrong,and finally I agree with the statement because people will never know if they will get better opportunities in a job,college or in general life,if they never try or they never force theirselves to be successful. First,if people never try something new,they will never know if the way they choose,was the best option because they will be always with the doubt thinking about what could happen if they were tried. They will never be brave enough if they never try to do something new because they are afraid. In my opinion the best example is when teenagers are in school,specially people who are from Central American countries,they are afraid because they do not speak the internacional language ""Enlglish"" so,they prefer do not try something like; speak with their classmates or even with their teachers,if they have any doubt they will never ask because they are afraid. They just do not want to try it because they are afraid classmates or teachers laugth about them,even when the teacher are good with them because some teachears are a kind of rude,not all of them but there are some of them. In my personal experience,the last year I had two teachers who was very rude with me and my friend. We were in our class when she asked for something that I did not understand and I asked her what was that,and she said that if we do not speak English we need to go back our conutry,and my other teachers was angry because in my class all the people was speaking Spanish and she said the same thing that my another teacher said before ""If you do not speak English just go baxk to your countries"". These are examples why teenagers are afraid to try new thins and they just prefer stay quite,but the only way to know how things are going to take place,is try it. If people try new things,they will be better person that they already are because they will figth for the things they want,they will be successful by theirselves. Second,if people try to do new things,they will learn more things that they already know. When people try something new the results can not be always positive. They can fail,but at least they were brave to try something that they never try before and they have to be proud of theirselves even if they did not get what they want. However if they did not get what they want,they learned something new because people learn from the mistakes. Mistakes are the best way to learn because you will know what to do the next time that you try the same thing until you get what you want. Does not matter if you are wrong,you will learn because the life is a lesson that you learn every single day. In my experience when my uncle wants to get his license,we went to the DMV so many times but he always fail his test. We went to the DMV about five times till the day he pass his test,but he never give up even knowing that he can fail the last time we went,he wants to try it again and keeping trying still they have his license with him. So do not get frustrate if you do not get it the first time you try,just keeping trying,you will get it. Finally,is people will never know if they will get better opportunities if they never try. So many people in the wolrd are looking for better opportunities but the most of the time they never get it,the only reason is because they never try. When people want to get a new job where they need to do something that they never did before they choose do not try it because they do not want to be wrong,but if they never try it,never will be better,never will get a best opportunity to be successful. Everybody is afraid about fail and fail is the most comun reason what people stop to doing something they want,but fail is not the worse thing in the world,the really worse thing is not try it. People can get better opportunities also in the college,they need to try something maybe the things can work good for them. Life is the best gift that we have,we can be sad,we can be happy,we can be whatever we want,and do whatever we want to do,but need to keep try it. If something does happened just like people want,keeping try it to get perfeccion. To get what they want,they need to force theirselves untill get and be who really want to be. Life is the best teacher we have. The life teach us be brave,be proud of ourselfs,be best person than we were yesterday,but life also teach us to figth to get better opportunities,and better lifestyle. In conlcusion,try new things is better than stay with the things people already have. Try is the best option that people have,does not matter what poeple say about the way people decide to take,everybody is going to choose the best way for their lives. So keep trying,on that way you will mastering more things than you already have. Does not matter how good you are or how many things you already have. You need to looking for most better thing,better opportunities. People do not have to be afraid,people need to be brave to get what they want. Do not give up if the things do not take the place that you want,just keeping trying. Always will be better try new things,to continue grow up than stay where you are with the things you already have. Better life,better opportunities,best person in the world. I am very agree with the statement,and you need to be agree,too.

Off this quote i feel that sometimes in life you can accomplish things with no effort but mostly, in life you gotta work hard to earn and get the things you deserve and have well accomplished in life. Another thing is that you gotta have a really good effort in life to get really far. I agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote on,"" how much maybe be done if we are always doing"" because thats how it has to be done in life , you gotta work for what you want and need, everything is earned in life and its way easier to get things that need to be done quicker by putting your effort and always working, than to just be standing or laying around doing nothing. One main reason i agree with Thomas Jeffersons quote is that you gotta work for what you get in life,you gotta always be doing something to get stuff done. Its an amazing quote that is used in a way that many dont think or have had the thought of. His quote is supporting the fact that it takes hard work and focusing to get work done and that work wont get done on its own. Another reason , is that no matter what you do , you always gotta work in life. To not take things for granted and actualy work and to not be lazy and get no work done that has to be done, done . Itll help out in the long run and make things easier in life by doing what you have to. Thomas Jeffersons qoute is there to incourage others to do great in life and do everything possible to get your goals achivied. This quote is a great figure of speech that can help out in the long run for people in need of it. One last reason i believe thomas jeffersons quote is a great and an amazing quote is that it justifys that life isnt easy and everything isnt free, also that things come with consequences. To also, not take things for granted and be grateful for what you got because thats the amount of effort you put in , instead of just laying down and or doing nothing at all. The quote has a alot of great reasons and thoughts that are put into peoples minds off this one quote it could help motivate someone in need of motivation. In conclussion, Thomas Jeffersons quote can help people that are in need of something to motivate them. To help them by telling them that its fasinating to see what you get out of completing your work by always doing something. Lastly, how easily it is to complete something by moving around and not just sitting and down absolute nothing about your work.

356,3484,EB0F373C1D2A,"Summer breaks in most countries are 45-60 days long. Students mostly enjoy the summer by going to a vacation or doing fun stuff. From students point of view, 60 day summer break is the last thing they want to lose. However, most student lose track of their studies after spending such a long break away from school. Furthermore, being 60 days away from your frisbee practice would massively impact your game; and the same applies to to studying, you will forget most of the lessons that youve learned. One might say, ""well there are summer classes to keep students connected with their studies."" But to be absolutely honest, no one wants to go to school in a hot summer day. We all want to lay low and have a cold drink in beach while listening to the satisifying sound of waves. What is the solution? Put an end to long summer breaks (not completely removing them), and instead give students a week off after every 4 week of studying. It gives students and the faculty a brief break after every 4 week, and also it gives students time to work on their important projects. For instance, if Im studying History of US Museums, I can get a chance to explore the museums and write an article of my own observation about museums in my area. Student cant get everything done on weekends so they need more time. Teachers on the other hand can keep track of the students during the 7-day break and ask them for their progression. Moreover, this gives students to participate in community services and/or religious services, which in my opinion, are crucial in building ones character. The summer break, however, is still there but shrinked to 2 weeks, giving students a chance to go on vacations and trips but not for long. All in all, 7-day break after every 2 week of school keeps students involved and connected to their studies, community and religion; while giving them the freedom they need to enjoy their summer without losing track of all the studies.

357,3485,3DFE1FE3FCE8,"Success is the most important thing in this world. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with him Because failure played a important role to be a success. Success is when people do hard work to get what they want to get from their lives. Most people want their success in school and to a dream job. Graduating from school is the big achievement because for some people its hard to pass sols or exam. They study hard to pass that class so they can graduate from school. Like if someone came from another country and that person does not know how to speak English. That person might fail all of the classes like English, history, and science. That person will try their best but they might not get on the first time and they will keep try until they get what they want. If some student fail there test from that failure that student know how they can fix in the next test or how they can be better then the last test. They can be more prepared. A lot people find a job which they like to do but some people does not get their dream jobs. And some people never give up. One person who want to be a dancer but his dad does not support him. He never give up to convince his father but still his father does not listen to him. He leave his house to be dancer but after leaving the house he has nothing, he dont even have money to pay for his school, but still he never give up. He started his know dance workshop where he get money so he can pay for his school. Now he is the one of the best dance choreographer in India Remo Dsoza. When people went for job interview some people get the job on the first time. But some people have to work hard until they got the job too. They work on how they can be better next time so they can get the job. In conclusion, success is the thing which everyone wants but they are not going to get it give they did not work hard. To became a successful people have to learn from their mistakes. Failure is the key of success because if people are not going to fail they cant be better next time.

Allowing high school students to graduate in three year is not a good idea because they wont be able to attend more elective classes in school, they will start stressing about a lot of school work, and they wont be able to enjoy their four years of high school with friends. Trying to graduate early is not the best because it could be so stressful, focusing on getting good grades and passing in a short amount of time. As the University of Virginia did an experiment on teenagers, that which they should not be putting too much stress on themselves. As some students like to work and want to succeed in the future so they think its faster and easier to graduate early. You should be in high school for four years as traditionally and not trying to rush through your high school years and graduate. You should enjoy your years of high school, as normal sometimes we have stress because its too much of work, but four years you get to have more fun classes. As three years you wont be able to be in elective classes, which it could lead to less opportunities. During summer you have to do school work so you can be able to graduate and also after school you have to do work. Some might think that four years of high school is too much but its really not that much, you really wont feel when the years pass by. In the other hand some students think that being in high school for only three years its a good idea because they think that its easier to get away from people and dramas, faster to start working, going to college faster, and they are rushing through life. They want to succeed but the faster way and they dont want to be in high school because they think its too long and it takes a lot of years through their lives. As in some school districts they offer programs which allows students to graduate in three years rather than four years as normal. Allowing high school students to graduate in three years in not a good idea because its too much stress about school work, they wont be able to be in elective classes, and they wont enjoy their high school years with friends.

363,3491,5C3757B0C6AE,"I agree that having a positive attitude is key to be successful in life. Having a good attitude in any working space is key to any job also you have never heard anyone in a party with a bad attitude and to be more honest with you having a good attitude anywhere will help you a lot. I agree just not only for having just a good attitude but to make some one smile and the bad vibes go away Im grateful that I have a good attitude. Also maybe having a good attitude in the work place will speed up your day so you could go back home and do nothing and relax. I work at a restaurant and I feel as in if i have a bad attitude at work time goes slower but when i have a good attitude at work time goes so fast. Its your first impression of a person it help if u have a good attitude it will help you on the long run. Make a situation for bad to good for a hundred to zero fast which is a good thing. Then, I think that having a good attitude at work will help a lot of people in the long run because you could find your future wife and you could find someone famous or better things. And most people dont think about how having a good and not bad attitude will benefit them. Having a good attitude will take you places were people could never think of and will help up be successful in like get a good job, get promoted,then get to the top and make lots of money. I know a lot of people want to be rich and make lots of money so got good attitude in life some dont. everyone have their own ideas and have their own perspective of each other. Lots of people are negative in the world most people have it the hard way became the are poor dont have anything more to live for but that is wrong people you need to keep your head up no matter what happens. After that, I think that I also said that being kind to people and giving them a smile will cheer a lot of people up, and make the world a better place and make everyone be grateful for what they have. People dont want to be by themselves they want to be with other humans and wants a better for everyone. In all honestly people should work for a better work space and have a good attitude. Having a good attitude is extremely good for work place and more. I think that people need to know whats bests for them and there heath. I also imagine lots of people with good attitude but there are a lot of people with bad attitudes. ",6,6,7,7,6,7,1189,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
364,3492,23FC0A3DF4C9,"In my opinion, I do believe that it should be an elective classes for students to take art, drama, and music classes because it has nothing to do with our education. It wont help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water. It has nothing to do with our and it should be optional for students to take any art classes whenever they like the class and the second reason is that students might not like the classes because they will be not be interested and will be bored because art is really not their thing. Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they dont want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they dont like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either dont like being there and just skip the class or theyre not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either. These classes are something that are easy, Something that you are good at, and something that interests you. So in my opinion it should be elective classes and not classes that should be required to graduate.",5,7,6,7,7,6,477,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
365,3493,A39660CA003E,"Imagine that you like photography but they required you to get music, art, and drama instead of photography they will be upset. Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because its their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes. If you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they wont do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you wont pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesnt like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say its required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if its for whole year I will choose they arent required. I think they arent required to take those classes, because those classes arent meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesnt need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they wont do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesnt like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective arent mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class. In conclusion that, if they choose its required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take. So I think that those classes arent required to take unless they want to take. ",6,7,7,6,7,7,2194,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
366,3494,D752DF2541DD,"Dear Principle, changing the policy is a good idea, because many people have c average, and if they play any sports, they might get a lower average than a c. Also they have to focus on their school work first than the sports, and like I said before playing sports might get them failing. Also, if nobody is making a change, on their grades than maybe she could change it but, meanwhile she should keep it to a b average to play any sports or to be in any activity, the students are going to try their best at making good grades to play sports. It is good in many reasons to keep a good average, because then they get their report card or their progress reports and they see that they have a low average, it is going to be because they are focusing to much in their sports or activities. The principle should first see how the students react to the changing, and if it works than, yea keep it, but she can always change it. It doesnt matter if they have a high C, but then need to have a B. Most students would argue about having to study, but i think its for their own good, also the school will change, for example, the school recognized for having a C average ad letting them play sports or do any activities, that could change if the students try hard enough and change the C to a B, then the school will recognized by having a B average on, most of the students. The reason that its best for students to have good grades, its because also at the end of the year if they dont have a good average, they will not be able to pass the year. Back to the point it will be challenging, but Im sure the students that love playing sports or being part of school activities, those people will actually try and make those grades, but if for some reason, those people who tried their best, like they went to tutoring, did all their home and school work, and turned it in, then you might want to check in with his/her teachers and see if they want to let them participate, but everyone can make at least a B, not an A but a B, because we all are very smart, some smart as others, but yes Im sure, it will all work out, but if they keep on complaining, and they dont actually try to do their best, and they slack off, go to sleep in class they you wont see a difference n their grades, then thats their lost, because we want our school to be recognized, with all of out players with a B. one of the reasons why i want the students to have a good average, its because, those who want to succeed will try until they get it right, but if you are the person who doesnt care, then whose fault is that? So i would like to have that policy. As i told you before, everyone is smart enough to pass their grades, even if, they dont think so. It wont be so bad, either, to try your best at school, even if you just do it for sports, but i you were the type of person that was failing, then now you can say that you are passing all of your classes, dont think of what other people have to say, just do it for yourself.",7,5,6,6,6,6,3003,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

368,3496,DBAE7F4F7837,"The reasons i would argue for students and teachers having a after school program. Fist, the student will have more knowledge. Second , When students are in private with teachers the teachers will teach them new stuff. Finally , So they students can study for quiz and test and pass the quiz and test. Theres more reasons but those are my reasons. When you go to school you learn. The longer you stay the more you learn more . The more you learn the easier it is to get in collage . Collage looks at people who learn a lot so the after school program is gonna make them have a better future. Learn more and youll have a better career. When you get tough new stuff it can be fun to learn about the new stuff your learning about . So when you learn new stuff you can be ahead of your class. Learning new stuff can make you twenty percent smarter than you usually are. Learning new stuff can get you a better job in the future. Theres always time to learn new stuff . By going to a after school program you can study for quiz and test. If you get a good grade on mostly all your test then your gonna have good grades and thats a fact. quizzes are mini test so you should also try to pass them because both are huge deals. Passing test can bring your grade from a F to a C+. Passing quizzes can bring your grade from a F to a D+. So they bring you from a failing grade to a passing grade.

These activitys should be done because they are very fun. An activity can be fun is like playing a sport their are alot of sports out there that can be fun and aggresive but its exciting to play a sport because you get to go on trips and you get to verse other teams or with only one player. you get to even become a professional player I played soccer for about two years and now i am good at it. Before in elemantary school i used to be bad at it and used to say ""im bad at this"" or ill say ""im not good at it"" but then i entered in a summer soccer program every evening or in the day i would go to a school and we would go to a soccer field. nI really loved that activity because you learn more and become good at it. Another activity that can be fun and cool and enjoyable is playing an insturment. It is fun because i used to play an insturment the last three years and it was fun because you get to go to trips. Last year me and my friends went to Generic_City. We went with the orchestra class, band, and even chores. it was fun. and its nice to play an insrument because you have alot of oppsions to choose from and you even get to play nice soothing music or loud and extreame. And the fun part is that you get to be in a stage with your friends and play music infront of the audiance. Another enjoyable activity is chemistry its fun because you get to mix different chemicals to objects or chemical to chemical. Me and my science class will be doing it this year i am happy to do it becaue i never mixed chemicals or never put on science goggles. i cant wait to do it this year we will be doing chemisry in april.

370,3498,CE2EC298670A,I think that it a good that some schools offer distance learning for the students because some of them cant go to the regular schools and some of them are not able to finished one school and the distance learning offer a good idea for them. and is a very good experience. If can be a good apportunity for does who cant fiinish the school for example Some of the students have kids and have to take care of them. Another reason is that the students does not have the support of their family and they have to work for them self. Also the family of the students can not affords the students education. The person who received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and that person is trying to finished now for get a better job. I think it good that some of schools offer distance learning. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of the kids. Next The students does not have their family support and they have to support them self and work. Also the families of the students can not affords the student education. And finally the person or students that received the distance learning it an oldest person who does not finish the school and is tying to finish now to get a better job. because with a better job they can support the baby they have and the things they want to finish up. First some of the students that are taking the distance learning have kids and they need to take care of them. Also the students a girl or boy get a pregnancy when they go to school and they had to leak of school for the baby. Also the parents make them to work because they have to support a baby. And some moms have to leak school because the other parent of the kid does not take care of the baby when she was pregnant. Study in the distance learning program they want work in the day and in the night they cant received classes. Next another good reason is that the students does not have the support of their families and have to work for them self. Some of the kids are immigrants and they doesnt have their parents in this country. And also the student have to work and maintain by them self. The students have to work and go to school .But sometime get difficult for them and the time it not always log as they want to do many things at the day. And it better to have a option .Because with that option that can still working and receiving a good education. Also another reason is that the families of the students can not affords the students education. And they try to do another thing for them like the parent can buy a computer. And with that the student can received the classes online or in the distance learning. But some of them use their phone to received their classes. Also some of them like to study but their parents cant not affords the school and they try to do anything to get a good education and a better future. Because that is going to help them to be able to have a family. And with that they prepare for the future. The last reason that why is a good idea to get the distance learning is because some of the people that is getting the classes online are oldest people the they did not finish the school and now theyre trying to finish the school .Because they want a better job and a better future for their family and their kids. Some of them did not finish the school and they now want to finished. They just want a opportunity to study and the distance learning give that opportunity to the old people that want to overcome. And that is a great help for the people that just want a better life a great future for them and their families. With that the people who is trying to finished the school can be prepare to have better opportunities of work. And also finished the school he or she can get a better job and be able to be with their kids. And dont leave their kids with another person many time. And spend more time with them. In conclusion the distance learning education is a very good idea in my opinion. because the people that can not go to school because they have kids or the teenager that have a pregnancy when they were on the school. That give opportunity for the people with low income. The people that can afford their school. And also the people that does not have their family in this country. The people who work and study and does not have the time to go to a regular school. Classes in online is good for does that need to finish the school. For does that when they were in the school have some problems. Also is a good benefit for those that there time is not long as they want. The people of the distance learning have good opportunity for their future. And can be productive for the people who does not have a work because they did not finish the school. because have an education is important for this country and for all the people that want a good life and better opportunities of work. Finally the distance education is a good ideas because help people with the things they want and that they need too. ,7,6,7,7,6,6,2832,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

374,3502,F0BB52DD1DB6,"I strongly agree with this statement that author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because i can relate to it based on my passed experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. I did not like to try new things as a kid because when i would fail at them i would get mad or upset. But i ended up trying new things in life anyways and it helped change my mindset from not pushing myself to believing in myself that i could accomplish things and also help me grow as a person. For example when i was l lot younger then i am today like a lot of kids i did not like to try new food. I was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. Say if i did not know what it was or had not try in before in the past i did not want it at all. Some times my mom would tell me to eat my food or she would not let me go outside or take me to the park to play. so i would eat it but not because i wanted to it was because i wanted to go play outside or go to the park because i was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside. Thinking back to those memories at least the ones that i can remember i always seem to get easily upset. When i did not know how to do something that other kids or people knew and could do. I would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a part of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time put towards them. So i could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. I think if i wouldnt have gave up on some things when i was younger i would have know how to do a lot more then i can today. Instead of just watching the other people do this type of activities and enjoy themselves. I always wanted to know how to play these sports as a kid. Like know how to play soccer,football,and play basketball. Instead i would give up on myself on the first time i failed at it. But as time went by and the older i got little by little i started to try new things in life besides just other foods. I think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and i did not give up on myself anymore i started to push myself to achieve my goals. I learn that anger would help me too like this one time in middle school i was in my math class my teacher said that i could not solve the problem that he had put on the board because i did not pay attention in class. So i got mad and did my best to solve him and show him that i could solve that problem and i did after class he came up to me and told me that he was proud and that he knew i could do it cause when someone tells me i can not i get mad and work hard to prove them wrong. He also told me to never let what other people say stop me from achieving my goals in life and to also try to control my anger. I understand that know because i know there people who look out for you and help you. But also there are lots of people that do not want to see you make it in life and do better then them. This is why i strongly agree with this author by the name Ralph Waldo Emerson and his statement. That go by the lines of unless you try to do something that you have never done before you will never grow. Its just how some people play it safe in life and do not attempt to do or try scary things in there life like rock climbing,sky diving swimming with sharks sneaking into abandon house cause its haunted by a ghost or something not like other people who live their lives with no fear. You can be scared i life but do not let them fears keep you from having fun and enjoying life.",6,8,8,7,6,6,3543,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

Unless you try to do something respect, you have to do the best of you if you want to grow. Base in my experiences Im growing, I try hard, and I try to convince the other do to the same, we want a better world we students to grow if they grow this will be a proud for the others. If we dont an open mind this will be the opposite we will never grow,no matter what is happening he we have to grow. At the end of all of this we will have something do where we can be support our live, always come something better, you have to be organize with your things.

If a member in the group does not come to school the group will fall behind and not turn the work on time. if a person in the group is sick with a virus they would have to miss school and miss work on the project and that would hold back the rest of the group from turning in the project on time.

When someone in the group does not care about the work the group will be held back because then more work would have to be done by the others. When being put with someone who does not care is hard because only the rest of the group is doing the work and putting in effort. Working in a group would also not be fun because you have someone who is not doing anything. When the group is working the one who does not care would be sleeping or on their phone.

If one person says they do not like that idea, the group would have to take time and all agree on something as a group. Agreeing on something would take up to one or two classes and that would waste a lot of time and put the project behind. When working alone there is not agreeing on anything, it is whatever that person chooses. Working in a group it would be more fun but when working alone more work can be done. Being pared with friends is nice but the amount of work able to get done when alone is a lot more.

My other reason why they shouldnt do the homework club is what if most teachers dont give out homework like i dont get a lot of homework but maybe somone else wouldnt get homework. Would any teachers parpicate in the homework club, do they know that teachers would argee on doing this club? How long would this homework club be a hour or 30 minutes at what would it end because students have stuff to do out of school. Do pranets know about this club would they let their childiren stay after schook is a way for them to get home if anyone cant pick the student up?? Would this homework club interfir with any other after school clubs or what if students already do a club and they need help with homework but they cant go to the homework club because they have to go to the club they do. Does the whole school want to do this or just some students cause not this club would be worthless. In conlusion i think that they should not do the homework club.",4,5,5,6,5,5,2058,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

Well Ive found a really good instrument that might seem easy but its actually difficult to learn and to play in front of judges. One of the most played and enjoyed instrument in a educational schools, concerts, and even TV shows is a ""Violin"". Violins are a really enjoyable and interesting to watch. But have you ever thought how hard it could be for a person to learn the music and strings? Well learning the music its hard for some. Mostly if you dont know what string plays what. The most easiest strings for people are the ""D"" and ""A"" strings. These strings are mostly used in every sheet of music you get. Movies play a lot of orchestra music. Not just regular music but ""Action"" movies. Why you might ask, well when a intense part starts the movie plays a soft violin. When the movie is getting more closer to the part they play 2nd violin, Chello and Bases. Chello and bases are loud and deep reasons why movies like to play them a lot. Have you ever went to a Orchestra concert near by? Well if you have you probaly know how loud they get. Well a side from Orchestra Violins playing in movies, orchestra also has their own assesment every school year. An ""Assesment"" is basically were a orchestra teacher gets to pick 30 students from their advance class and take them on a mini ""field trip"" representing the grade level and schools orchestra. What students basically do is play in front of professional judges from different counties. They rate your performance from 1 being the best, to 5 being the worst.

And some students not have idea about the projects from teachers but when students choose their projects they have good ideas about their projects.

I think that imagination is more powerful than knowledge because you can come up with many things and in order to get knowledge on something you need imagination. Imagination is something you need to come up with things. You need to think about it first, get the things you need to create it, and then study from it.

Its ok to make mistakes while learning, you just have to learn from them. In conclusion I think imagination is more important. We use out imagination every day. We learn things every day. It would be hard without imagination. Imagination can be used for a lot of things like making a cartoon show, drawing, and thinking. You can also use you imagination while you read.

381,3509,42BF43BF8DBE,"Why does the curfews are important in some cities and state for teenagers? The importances of having curfews in the cities is that they will be out of trouble. Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers. Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it. Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young peoples lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they dont know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they dont listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew. In conclusion, the importances of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble. Some people says that curfew is a force on young peoples lives. Therefore, teenagers should be responsible, follow the law, and keep yourself out of trouble.",7,7,7,6,7,8,871,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

384,3512,FC5120C98AE7,"I think that all schools should offer video or online conferencing as well as online education form the school. Students should be able to be comfortable from where ever they are, and learn in a manner that they are comfortable with. There maybe different reasons where students may not come to school. However, if they do miss school students can have the abillity to turn in work and learn about what they missed. This would be good and better for teachers because students would have no excuse of them not turning in there work late or at all. Students may miss school for all types of reasons, for exmple students can miss school for an urgent reason or a family situation. Some familys dont have enough resources to live off a good life, so, some students cant make it for school and have to work to support there families. In some cases familys have younger sibilings that they have to take care of, but the family cant afford to stay home and have to work. In that case families make students stay home to baby sit a little brother or sister. Students miss the education they need, and thats a good reason why they should have online based learning. Having said that students may also be very sick and may not be able come to school. Students may also have variuse injuries that can be hard for them to move in certain areas, therefore they stay home and miss school. students could be in the hospital, and may not return to school for a long period of time, it could also be hard for them to transition back and catch up with his or her school work. Some students may be takeing care of a sick relative and my not be able to make it to school. online base learning would be very helpful to those students that are injured or sick. Students also tend to leave the country, and go back to their countrys. Families make arrangements to visit their home countrys in the middle of the school year. in some cases families dont come back for long periods of time. Students tend to miss a lot of school work and education in the time they are gone. Online based learning would come in handy in this situation. Students could have fun where they are, and not miss a single assiegnment or a day they are learning something new. Online based learning is the best solution to students missing school. It would be a great oppertunity for students to get back on track and finished what they started. I would recommend online based learning because I think of the families that are in deep need by the students that come to school in helping their families. I also think of the people that are sick, and that need rest at home. This program would help a lot of students get the education they need without worrying they wont get it.

I do not, i believe that if you give a student false praise then the student is going to get lazy & stop producing work with the quality and efficiency that they used too. In truth I was just like this, I once had a teacher who put so much false hope and praise in me that i started to not care as much as i used too, it effected my social life & determination as well as my standards, intent & self-esteem, I was no longer able to spend more than five minutes on work without getting distracted or discouraged, eventually i came to terms with the fact that not all my work was gonna be perfect, but if i spent enough time on it then it would be a hundred times better. So what is the best way to build self-esteem, well that would be hard work and dedication, lots of people think that just because they do some work they should instantly be rewarded, there work does not even need to be good, for them to think they deserve praise. The best way to actually build confidence is through achievements,when you accomplish something and you do it well you get this since of success unlike the half baked work most people get credit for. Once you actually build up confidence everything in life gets easier, you start doing your home work on time, when a test comes up you would be very well prepared to get an A, your friends and teachers start to respect you more & your parents will be proud of you, but most importantly you will be proud of yourself.

People who change for others . There is a lot of ways to become you. When you know who you want to be as a person thats when you pick up traits. When you want to be something you start learning things. You cant have character if you dont want to be someone. Character traits are things people notice about you.

387,3515,402CAB074577,"In some districts, teenagers that are in high school take courses in the evenings or during the summer in order to graduate in three years instead of four years. Students who take the three years program do not have elective courses and have to study harder than others. I think it is an unconscious idea to graduate in only three years instead of four. In fact, I strongly disagree with the purpose of that program. To begin with, students who decide to study during evenings and summer will be constantly overwhelmed. Because the academic level is more intense in colleges, they will tend to quit when they enter college and start working without their college degrees. For example, one of my friend graduated last year after only 3 years of high school. He used to stay late at school because of his extra courses. Last summer, he started college. After only two months, he started giving up by going to work at some restaurants rather than going to his classes. I had a conversation with him last month. He assumed that he stressed himself over the past three years and now he can not do it anymore. Based on his experience, I realized that grinding to graduate in only three years will help some students finish high school earlier than the others, but it will not take them further. In addition, students who decide to graduate with the program of three years and go to college or work usually lose track of their social life. Because they dedicate their entire time on studying, they do not have time to enjoy their life and have good memories with people around them. For instance, a few years ago, my older sister who decided to graduate with the program of three years in high school lost track of her social life. She used to go to school every single day including the week-ends. She was combining that tough program with her part-time job. I could literally stay at least three days without seeing her despite the fact that we lived in the same house. When she finally graduated and went to an out state college, it was worse because she used to answer my messages every month instead of every day. We lost any type of affinity that we had because of that program. It was also hurtful to see that at the end it was not worth it because she gave up after two years of college. Obviously, the program of graduation in three years has a negative effect. However, some say that it is an advantage that people should consider because it will help them start their career one year earlier. I respect their point of view but I believe that the traditional graduation after 4 years is essential because students will have time to be mature before getting into the most challenging part of life. Therefore, I still strongly disagree with that idea of graduating in three years. In conclusion, the traditional graduation after four years in high school is crucial and we should stick to it. Because high school is where teenagers grow in their social life, no one should break the pattern by trying to graduate earlier. In order to protect teenagerssocial life and help them grow adequately during their adolescence, I urge the authorities to outlaw the program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four.

There always have been solutions for every single situation,for all the people who does not give up. Those who believe, that success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm have their reasons. They believe that failure does not give a good outcome to be re joy of;They seem failure like a pain hurting people making them feel really bad, and it makes them not to keep trying. They also think that failure make them doubt themselves,and that is not true my argument is not to give up so easily. They have to try until they get it done,and clearly,but nevertheless they regret it. In my point of view, I believe that when failure occur we get stronger. An example of this would be my friend Generic_Name: 20 years old, a white man,black eyes, and black hair. He wanted to go to college, to study electricity, but his finance was slow,so decided to learn it without going to college. I knew right away that he will be challenged to make his way thought,so he start practicing looking tutorials, how to fix things, how to change a lamp, all that kind of stuff,but my surprise was when the time pass he apply for a electricity company. I said to him ! are you serious ! dont tell me that you already know electricity. He got a moment of silence... and respond yes, i make my own way he start explaining me all the difficulties part that he was on. He said that at some point he wanted to just forget that,but something inside of him wanted to keep trying. Of course the people were saying no you cant do it in a funny way,but he did not listened to the people. Moreover he wanted to keep going. He knew that it was something hard to become an electrician,but not impossible. Today Generic_Name is a really good electrician. He did not only learned electricity. He also learned how to paint houses. This is a proof that we cannot give things up only because it seem hard. It is not based on your finance. Some people have a low economy,but still there is not wall that can stop the willing to do something. It only required a personal character and volunteer. What might happened if Generic_Name loss the enthusiasm he probably will be putting less importance on him. I also think that when failure occur frequently, we will know and meet our level our own capacity, like what are we made of. A prove of this can be my sister in law. She was on high school senior year. She had some problem in her algebra 2 class at the beginning she did not understood anything. She was in every single class,but the problem was that her grades in algebra were critical,so she talked with her boyfriend Generic_Name which is my brother. She was saying that she did not wanted to go to her algebra 2 class. Not anymore,because it was too hard she feel less intelligent and she wanted not to keep trying. My brother respond, I think that you are just starting in the way that you have not try like I would like you to try, if you doubt yourself that is a problem,because I can see a really smart person right in front of me. Believe in yourself and try again after that, she decided to give everything or nothing, so she was studying really hard, asking a lot of questions to the teacher, with that hunger to learn, and be the best in her Algebra class. Even though her classmates were ironic. Her eyes were not on them. In addition she learned a lot at the beginning she was below of her classmates, more often she was the Hornet in her class with a reward for trying super hard, and get things done on time. Image what might occurred if my sister in law give up, so easily of course she will fail the class in all quarters and have that tone of loser on her. In conclusion, when failure comes dont let it the opportunity to take over you,because you will be thinking of yourself bad things. If you are having hard times and you cant see things clear, just ask these question to yourself Do i am doing enough for it or i am just starting?. every single of us have a big ability there no exceptions. there is people who really know what they want,and fight for it and there is people who easily give things up. We should be those kind of people who does not look for their goals and dream who are sitting down expecting how other people naturally reach to their dreams.",7,6,6,6,5,6,753,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
395,3523,F47F7676912A,"I met a friend online from Generic_City, therefore I went to visit him and learn a lot about his culture. In this paper I will argue about that the use of technology haves a positive effect on peoples lives and human contact. In my opinion technology haves a positive effect on people lives because they can find new jobs, meet new people , and communicate with other people that you are nervous to talk in person. Having a hard time finding a job? Theres a lot of jobs available online and you can sign up online without going to the store and ask for a job application. If your sick and cant go to work, therefore you can contact your boss online and ask for a day off and avoid getting fired by not coming to work. If you need to talk to your boss and he is not in work you can send him a online message. You can see that technology helps your job to be more easier without having any problems. Dont you feel bored knowing only about your culture? You can meet people from different culture online and learn more about there style of life. Technology helps you vision other peoples thoughts and opinion from another country. Technology is the glue that helps a lot of people from different culture work together and hate each other less. people can learn how to fix there mistakes by seeing other people online from different cultures instead of fixing it on your own tradition way that may be harder or useless. For example i learn how to fix a car much more easier by following my friend method from Generic_City. I havent seen my family for six years and only talk to them by sending text messages. Im shy and nervous to communicate with them in person. Technology helps you built that confidence to talk with other people from around the world or people that you care for. It Doesnt matter if you only communicate with them sending only online messages. At least you are expressing your feelings your thoughts and your opinion to your loves one or your friend that you are shy to talk in person. Some say technology is ruining human contact with other people in person . But they are wrong because technology helps you to meet new people, find a job, and communicate with people that your are nervous to speak with. I hope one day people around the world understands that without technology we wouldnt have the diversity we have in this world today.",8,8,7,8,6,7,3625,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

397,3525,2A9FC8634742,"What does it feel to achieve a high score on an English test after you study all week for? Pretty good right? You feel like all that sacrifice and long hours of study were worth it. All the confidence you build up was because of your own work. True self-esteem comes from achievement. Students and famous artist show us that without hard work, there is no true love for ones self. First, school is the environment where students learn. In this building students especially show that in order to feel good and confident you work for it. For example; when playing a sport such as soccer, the athlete need to believe in itself to be an outstanding player and for his teammates to trust him when making a play. If the player does not believe in himself, his teammates will not chose him to guide them as the captain or simply as giving passes with the ball. Continuing, a famous artists in the music industry named Lady Gaga show that when you believe in your passion and you give all of you in an scenery, the feeling of comfort and satisfaction is more than words. Gaga could not be where she is right now if people would have been sorry for her and just give her a contract without talent. In order to success you have to yourself and thats what she did, she develop her talent and now she is the most successful female artist in the music industry with ten gramys and many other recognition. Contrary, some teachers agree that in order to build self-esteem students need to be commemorated for effort even if the work is not excellent but, why should students get recognition for not making their best effort? This would be unfair for all of the students that work hard for that test score. Feeling sorry for a student is not going to make them successful in life. To conclude, all the hard work you put in a sport or your passion is going to help you succeed in life. Students are capable of so much and if a teacher praises an alumnus for work that its not worth a good grade, students will feel like they have not done something right and instead of building their self-esteem you would be creating an under qualify teacher or president. Is that what you want for their future? ",7,8,9,8,7,9,558,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more subjects than online classes. If students does not attend classes at school there would not be teachers and staffs at the school. Attending classes at school will get the students to learn more of other subjects. If a student takes classes at home they would not be focusing on their assignment. They going to be on their phone, TV, or other type of devices. There will be no one supervising the students at home. They need teachers to teach them, educate them, and motivate them to learn. Attending classes at school as you can see will benefit the student.. In addition, If the students does not attend classes at school there would not be no teachers and staffs at the school. Many jobs will be lost due to students taking classes online. Plus, the students needs to build a relationship with the teacher and staffs. Online classes would not teach a student face to face, It would be better If a teacher teaches the student face to face. As a result, there should be teachers and staff at the school, If the student takes classes at the school. Plus, the students will get a better education. Many people may argue that students should take classes online instead of going to school. People think that online classes will give the student benefits.

In the other hand, they are people who also believe that taking classes in school is better. Schools are meant for students to learn on other subjects.

399,3527,9F401E75755A,"In this writing you will find some reason why, 4 years of high school and graduate are better than, 3 years of high school and compare the opportunities that you can find during this years of high school and also help you to make to take your choice. High school is a great place to know people that could help you in the future, and help you to reach your goals also high school is a great place to learn a lot of things and have fun at the same time. In my opinion, 4 years of high school are better than 3 years because you have more time to study, you are able to have a break during summer, and keep your stress lower. During this 4 years of school you are able to have enough time to study and prepare for a test, if you have a History test you have time to ask to your History teacher to help you, before or after school to make a review or practice, and get ready for the test. This is one reason why 4 years of school are better then 3 years of school, and you will be able to prepare for your next test also you can have some rest in summer. In 4 years of school you will have a break during summer, and able to enjoy it with your family or friends doing some activities as going to some parks or museums, and any other different activities that you will like to do, and maybe go back to the school with more energy after summer. This reason also could help you to keep your stress lower when you are in high school. When you are in high school you can stress a lot because you have to many homework and you need to study for a test, and if you take the 4 years of high you will have a lot of time to study do your homework and keep your stress lower, and during this 4 years you can practice some sports or any activity that you like in your school or outside the school and also this could help you to keep your stress lower. During this process of learning you could find people that are not agree with your opinion and they can say 3 years of school are better then 4 yours of school. 3 years of high school sounds great for some people they want to start working or maybe they think it could be easy but you will not able to enjoy your summer because you have a program to follow during summer, and sometimes you would need to stay after school for study, and you are not able to do the different activities that you like. In my opinion 4 years of high school are better then 3 years of high school and in this 4 years of high school you will be able to graduate and you can enjoy the process of learning, and know a lot of people that could help you to graduate and reach your goals in the future.

400,3528,BBB9D66F934C,So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School. Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen. So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50 chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year,5,5,6,5,6,5,2530,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Also some people might says that cell phones can effect students study and their grades in school, and it is not a good thing for students to having their cell phones in classroom. However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations. Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom. Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students. One possible solution to this issue might be using cell phones only for an emergency problems or education problems. some students that can control the limit of using cell phones.

402,3530,A6AECACCFAA8,A problem can be good or bad. you can learn from the problem that you made. Sometimes you cant learn from the problem you did. I can agree and disagree with this statement. Not all people can think it can be true because you can do something wrong and get in trouble for it. You can keep doing the same problem and not care for it. You can choose what your problems are. You dont need to have a problem to do your best. You can be good at something and not have a problem with it. Some problems are good because you learn from whats good and bad. If you do something thats wrong its ok. Because doing the right thing can be hard for people to do. Much of the time theirs something you cant do about it. People choose to take the wrong path for their life and some dont. The ones who take the wrong path will go though a lot trouble. They would have a lot of problems that they cant change but just cause you that path doesnt mean you change it. Even the ones who are living good doesnt mean their not going though some problems because everyone does. So what I think its trying to tell us is would you work out your problems to become the best. You can change one problem thats is stopping you from doing something. That you can change the wrong thing to a good thing. Even if you mest up doesnt mean you are bad.

The benefits of working with a group, or working alone are complete differents because some people feel more comfortables working alone than working in groups. In my oppinion working alone is much better than working in groups. In some cases your teammates of you group dont participates in the work or they dont want to work in groups. I feel more comfortable working alone for many reasons. First reason , I can do whatever I want to do in the work or do the work in my way, but in some cases the person who work alone doesnt know how to do the work in this case is good to work in group because maybe your teammates knows the answers of the work. Second, If I work alone I have more chances to unertand the work by my self without distractions. Because in some cases your teammates of your groups are distract you or other teammates of the group. Third, working alone can be more benefict than working in groups because you can learn more things about the work, and do it in the way you like the work, without worry about what your group is doing. If we work alone we will have the opportunite of learn more about the work. I know working in groups are the easy way because maybe your teammates of you groups knows the answers of the work, and you dont have to worry about the work because you know your teammates will do the work for you . But in some cases people who dont participate in the work gets credits in the work what he or she doesnt participates it. And that isnt fair for you or your teammates who did the work.

407,3535,15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience. Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well. On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have. To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us. Life could be bored if you are stack doing what you already know and not trying something else.",8,6,7,7,6,7,294,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
408,3536,B543953F757A,"When I think about and enjoyable activity, I think about sports, and the reason why its because a lot of people find sports as a fun way to be healthy and make them feel better of them self by being physically active, I also believe that any sport is a good example to learn from others as well as your self, and for I know sports is not all of just about competing against other teams and winning or loosing, is very helpful if were talking of team work. One of the most enjoyable activities in the world its sports, in some way many different kind of sports have proof that its a really entertainment thing to do and to be as much healthy then doing a diet from a doctors recommendation, people actually agree that if theres something that might have a plethora of fun and includes a reason to be healthy in daily life its sports,a 78 % of people in planet Earth consider and invited people to joying a sport for the good of others and good of your self too. Sport its a specific activity that in cases have help people feel better about who they are, how they look, and the way it has change people globally, most of the time a person doesnt know what they like to do even thought they try other stuff like being smart, video games, music etc, they feel like they dont belong or fit in something, but at the end they go along about what other friends says about sports and find them self the right place to be. Sports as a good educational activity example of learning about others as learning from your self, is very important when getting a job that consist in the statement of knowing other people, like being a teacher, a teacher doesnt get a job without presenting him/her in general to his/her teachers partner, or teach a class without presenting to the students in classes theyll be taking, they will also ask a new student to present him/her self to every one in the classroom,teachers mostly do with their classroom as a coach will do with his team in a sport. These two educational activities are alike to each other in the simple reasons that they both teach their learners to get to know each other and get along with one another, another way that theyre alike is that theyre preparing them for the big challenges, a English teacher prepared the students for the big writing SOL as a soccer coach prepared the players for the final game of the season. However its not only learning from others, many times sports definitely let you learn more about yourself, it takes out the person who you truly are it will also take all those stuff that you had no idea you new, doing sports can have experiences in which youll learn from. Team work is the hard work that a group does together to complete their goal, its not about the leader or the best member of the group, what most matter in team work is work as a group no matter the worst or best you do. If you ever play a sport you might know that the main thing to do is team work, for example football,if one of the football players has the ball, he cant go across the field and do a touch down if his team mates dont do anything to stop the defenders of the other team that wants to knock him out,but if they decided to play the game by doing team work he would of made a touch down because hes team mates would of help him pass through by knocking the defenders. Sports team around the whole world has a immense number of followers, followers keep on touch with them because they have something relative to it or because they had won a lot of times,and this is thanks to the strategy they do ( team work ), In conclusion sports are not only of competing against others, is something that is productive in the way that you dont only get a metal or a good job, sports are also to have fun with friend or even with people you dont know, and its a really good way of being healthy and be able to do two things at the same time, it also help us understand other people that needs it as you do with your team mates by knowing them and getting along with them, in sports you can learn from your self when you make a mistake, and finally in any kind of sport you will have to know how to play as team work because thats what matters in teams. There is a lot of other educational an enjoyable tings to do but I think sports are one of the best ones.",4,4,6,5,5,6,2439,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
409,3537,FDA7648F8B49,Some school offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in tree years instead traditional four years. Must students who follow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective course. One reason that I agree with this chance that this programs it is offering. because must students like me need to take the high school diploma and try go to college or try to find job. When they have the high diploma ready. Must students take time during the summer to on focus in class or during the evenings. Because someones students work k in the morning and the rest work during the evenings. But all this students want to go to college. This should the first reason why could be a reason this program. can allow the students get the high diploma done. Other reason this program that be offering this chance that must student get the diploma between three years should a very important oportunide to think in try to finish high school or try to enter to the college. because is must students have the oportunide study and be ready to go to the college .also should help them try follow theirs goals what they want to be in the future this program is a good idea to must students.

Sometimes my friends dont like helping the community service because she doesnt care but i tell her its important to help the community because if we dont we just might not have water, food, etc. When my OTHER_NAME was here in LOCATION_NAME she sometimes take me to the park and pick up trash from the floor and throw it on the trash can or sometimes she takes me to go and check in the trash can to see if there is cans so we could recycle it. After when me and my OTHER_NAME was at the park picking up the trash we saw these two guys that were throwing food on the floor and I told my OTHER_NAME look those guys are throwing food on the floor so when they left I went and picked up what they threw on the floor cause its important to help the community service.

411,3539,3498E7E2DAB6,"In the principals office there is quote stating that "" your life can be beneficial if your doing something very productive, because it can lead you to great success in life"" In some way we ask ourselves if we are do something with our lives and be thinking ahead on what we want to do with our life and what can take us to success. Is that true?. Its more than just having something to do. Life is very short, As long as you are doing something with success. Living is an option as well as just giving up and not trying very enough. Accomplishing something in life to any dream you want to have. If you dont try as hard in life, you will never succeed and imagine all those who gave up and thinking... Where they are now?. Living life can only be chosen just by you and its only your choice to think in what direction you want to take. Although some may believe that life,belief, and hope prove that doing something with your own future can accomplish and lead you to a successful life. Your life can be turned around very quick, if only you are doing something very little that makes you happy and know that sticking with it, can take you anywhere you want in your future just only by trying and not giving up on your own self. Not trying and thinking way ahead of your own future can bring yourself down which can lead you to depression, low self of esteem , and as well of not having very much hope. In human society it has been discovered that in most of our population much as 40% of our people in the U.S are unemployed and dont have anything to do which leads them to go down in their life. There is so much poverty going on in this world and just by thinking about it and you think to yourself and say what did they do wrong in life that brought them to were they are now?. Your future can be so easy as long as you try and have hope in your own self. Just by knowing that you have accomplished anything in life can lead your own way to success. Your future can only be held in your hand no one else. Like its said once life can only chosen due too live a long term of time or short period of time its all held under your back, your shoulders, and your own self future. Being successful life is very important to your life having many accomplishment can make your self feel very motivated and make it very good. You can make your life very easy and not to hard just as long your are doing something that makes you happy and also as long what right direction you are taking and what good path is in your way. Life isnt easy either, it can be very difficult just as long as your trying at your very best and your pushing yourself into having great success, you will be at your very best and the top est you can be. The choice you make, can make it very effectively on you and it can change anything. The make key in life is as well having much belief on your own future or in life. Belief can only be happened by you and no one else, It can be very good and at its best just as long your try and making your life not to difficult. Having belief isnt bad at all its just a feeling you have on yourself and that the feeling makes it good for just for yourself and no one other. Every person in the world is very different in their way, everyone isnt the same in the way you see or in the perspective you think in. In society each person can think any type of way they want and they only problem is that you should be only be worrying about yourself but no other. There has been many issues due too how you believe and what others think about you and get to worried about it. Our world shouldnt be like that, in our belief we should stay positive in each one of us and stay motivated in any situation you go through. The belief in come in any one and whoever think in the mindset of way, we can all go through difficult times and not have any belief in ourselves. But only yourself can change no other can do that for you. The accomplishment in life can mean allot in yourself and can also have no good beneficial idea just for you, but something you can also do is give a big impact in human society. In setting a good state of mindset can change you very completely, another word to help yourself could also be hope. Having hope could lead you very far in life and also having great accomplishments that can also lead you to a big success. If you cant see it but others can see how your life is being impacted on you not doing something with your life. Only you can change that, but as others cant. Another key to life is hope. It can take you very far and also lead you in any direction yourself takes or as well in any path you want. Having hope is an option and a belief you want or can have. Not every person has hope or believes in themselves because all they want too do is fail. Others can see you fail and not try, but it is very hard for you to see yourself. In life if you have it can lead too do good things in life and have great accomplishments that no other has, just by having good hope. Just know to yourself that having hope can lead yourself to great victory and a great life that no other can have but you. In those who dont believe that if are doing something isnt an accomplishment to success, which that takes my position in saying that themselves thinking that is wrong. Because a key to success in life is having many accomplishments and lead you very far. But in those who also say that being inactive is a way too success is also wrong on their point of view and isnt a true fact statement. Inactivity cant take you too far in life and isnt a beneficial success to life. Having anything to do that you enjoy can lead too good accomplishments and also great success. Having a great life,hope, and belief can take you very far and lead you to any direction or path you want to take. Any one can have a great life just as long as you try. Life is easier as long you make it a success. ",5,6,6,7,4,6,683,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
412,3540,9551DA943B01,"First impressions are very important because that is the way people know you. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change and I agree with that statement, because it is hard to change peoples mind and the way they think about you. When someone know you or see you for the first time, the way you act, speak or the way you look is what they use to create an idea of how you really are. And when people already have an idea of how you are it is very hard to make them think different. Sometimes when you tell them you are a different person, they wont give you a chance to demostrate if is true, and they will just keep the idea they already have. People who knew you time ago and did not see you again they will keep the idea that they have about you, even if you already change. Sometimes you meet people in the wrong moment, and they get a bad impression about you. Then they just keep their distance or go away and you can not do anything to change their opinion. First impressions are very hard to change because the majority of people judge you on the first thing they notice about you, it can be your appearence or the way you act. Although I think first impression are almost impossible to change there are people who thinks that it is not hard to change first impressions , and they may be not wrong also, because there are people who give you an opportunity to start over and show them that you are different; However even if there are some ways you can change the impression that someone has about you, there are more reasons why it is almost impossible to change first impressions. To conclude first impressions are almost impossible to change and people should be more carefully about first impressions. Because it is very hard to change the way a person thinks. and also it can affect your reputation. ",8,8,8,8,8,8,1976,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Many other students and parents are going to help us organize this program. This program is going to help educate many elementary school students and make a good future for them. I will do my best to make those students successful. You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate. We need as much students as possible. Helping people is one of my hobbies. We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time. We can provide sports and other things that they want. We can make it as an after school program. We should also provide buses to people that are going to stay. Mr. Principal let me handle this program and make it ready for all students.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and dont do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school. it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

415,3543,39F27C7223DB,"Have you ever want an extra help in a subject or some extra help in finishing your homeworks correctly? Studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start an afterschool homework club. Im gonna agree with this idea because its a helpful club for all the students , and it can make a big different in our grades! I can tell you the purpose and the reasons why did i agree with this idea! In order to be proud and gain many students achievement, you would like to have some extra help to improve your learning memorize. In my school, i can see therere already students that did a wonderful job, but the president, teachers, would like to have some more to be proud about their school. According to that, afterschool homework club could be a good way to make it came true. Also, participate in this club can help you understand a learning target more clearly. Why dont you agree and try? Teachers and students volunteer to meet with those who need help either in homework or extra help in certain subjects. Example, an important test that could include stuff from last year or stuff thatre hard to understand, an afterschool homework club can help you out with teachers and students! In an afterschool homework club, you would feel more comfortable than in class. Because you can talk about many subjects, have fun with your friends, feel free to start a conversation about ideas or topics. Its extremely entrusting. You can also ask for a common study guide for the whole club and we can all solve together to increase teamwork skills. Then we can help each others on what they get stuck, and we will get their help back! This is another way to improve your learning memorize in an afterschool homework club. Gaining some achievements, improve your grades, be proud of yourself, afterschool homework club can help you. It may sound very simple, but it can effect your learning a lot! Thats the reasons why i said that i agree with the idea to set up this club. I would like my school to start to establish afterschool homework club. Would you agree or disagree?

416,3544,52A8DE60E2D4,"Imagine a world thats black, gray, dead, full of people with depression, this could happen because of how people think that small kind acts couldnt help others at all. These small acts of kindness could benefit the whole world, change it too. This could Create self reputation. Self reputation can be created a lot of different ways, but one kind and easy way is by being kind to others around you, this could help create or maintain relationships of any kind, another way this could benefit you is because sometimes other people will be nice to you in exchange this could impact you and others immensely, i know this from experience because sometimes i just give a simple short compliment to others and it lights up their day, and sometimes when i am feeling down and its noticeable, people are nice to me in exchange. This would make you more noticeable anywhere, people will know you as the kindest guy/girl around, so then people will ask you for a compliment or they will be nice to you. This next way i will be talking about could really help out our community, or even the whole world. This could change the world because, the world we live in is pretty corrupted in many ways, but we could change that by being nice to others, for example if you are nice to someone they are going to feel happy so that person would want others to feel happy so he is kind to others, so it basically just loops, if more people are kind then the more people they will influence causing more people to be kind. This could give others the reputation they want, like being more noticeable, i know this because it happened to me, i had just decided to be kind to others around my school, and it made me more noticeable, causing other classmates to be nicer in order to be more noticeable, so everybody wins practically. Lastly a really kind way to impact others with kindness is, you could make them feel better about themselves, like Aesop said, ""No act of kindness, no matter how small, is ever wasted."" Like complimenting someone could make their day, and this impacts them and others around that person because they noticed that someone had been nice to that person and had made their day too, because its wholesome. You could change peoples lives, like it changed mine, i was usually around 11 years old, and i had some trouble at school and home, but the people that are my friends now, just made my whole year, maybe my whole life because i knew some of them were going to stay with me till the end. You could be kind to someone that really need support, like people that are having trouble at home and school, this could change their lifestyle into a more happy way. These are all reasons why no matter how small and act of kindness can be it could really change someones life.

Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you. To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesnt impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You dont have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire. Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and dont allow nobody to make you do something that you dont think is wrong. However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something. Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldnt succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesnt goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

We can get so much benifit out of it. It helps people to get more friends and make a good community. It also make our family think that we are smart and make them feel proud of us. The first thing we all should do is to love our self if we cannot do that it will be hard for us to control our positive attitude. if we dont love our self we cant love others as well as you do to ourself. We are human we cannot be same as others in some point we make mistakes in life we always should try to move forward. Some of us might have have seen some people they cant be satisfy with their life beacause of their behavior and the way how they think of there life. We need to conduct our self in a perticular way to bring the power of success. There are many people who cant show their love to people or who are kind of broke on their life most of them have negative mentality. Its not their fault maybe the situation makes them to be like that some of us living with depression and it causes a massive differents into our brain our thinking area and more other part or side effects. It also happened to me when i was freshmen during the highschool year. I started to giving up on my life i didnt feel like to doing anything in life. Every single day was the hell of my life. i broke down myself and put my self somewhere where no one can find me. I didnt talk to anybody just trying to stay at home all the times and realised how could i get out of this kind of situation. I was starting to loose friends in that time.

I felt negative every time. I tried so hard to change the situation but it didnt work. I didnt have anyone to share my feelings all i did is just to kept that in my heart and made my self cry alot.

After few days passed one of my friend came to my house just to visit our family member and me. when i see him i was little happy to see him after a long time. i took him into my room and we were talking about somethings and recently he came up with a topic which is call depression. He knew how i was feeling with my life so he started to giving me some lesson to make me feel better and everything. First he told me i need to changed the way how i think about my self and people and he also told me there are many people who always try to push others down and make them feel bad and make you think something that is not good for you. My friends told me to ignore those and listen to my own heart. No matter, how u feel, always love your self and change the way how you think of youself. As a human no body is happy about their life in some point their sad but the main thing is we got to move onto forward. Forget about everythings that happened in the past. After he have told me all the lesson i was feeling way better than the past i realised how crazy i was before and the way of my thinking. My friend he was so motivated. Whatever he told me it was so appriciated to me and it forced me to changed my self to become a normal and to be a possitive person. I decited to not to keep my life stop because i dont want to be in the same situstion as before. I want to make my family friends and all of my relatives feel proud of me.

422,3550,20E194B18D0E,"The debate was using cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some people think using cell phones in the classroom is not good because as soon they grab phones, they will start texting their friends. Some people feel that using cell phones for educational purposes is a good idea because they will do their work. I believe using cell phones in the classroom will distract students, they wont pay attention, and they will stop working. First reason why using cell phones will distract students because they will listen to music. They will start using Snap chat, Instagram, and Facebook. When my teacher tell us to take out your phones, the first thing I do is to text my friend. I dont like using cell phone because Ill get lazy to do work. Without using phone I have responsibility of doing homework and classwork. One day we were doing a group project, so one of my partner was using phone and he was listening to the music. The teacher told us to share it with the class and give some more details while explaining. Three of us did what the teacher told us to, but the guy who used phone, he had no idea what to do then he got F for that assignment. Second reason why students should not be using cell phones because they wont pay attention to what the teacher is saying. It will create a big problem because teacher will get tired of explaining and none of the students will listen to her. Even I will stop paying attention because I will start watching my favorite TV show. Only few students will pay attention because they must have their parents pressure, without that I can guarantee that no one will do what the teacher is telling them. Without paying attention to the teacher while she is giving instruction for the class will make students fail the class. Third reason why school should not allow students to use cell phones because they wont do their work. If I know that I can use my phone then I wont do anything because I get too lazy to do it. Without doing homework or classwork students will get F and it will harm them after graduating high school. When I was a junior, I was using my phone in the chemistry class while doing a lab. By mistake I dropped chemical on my phone then I lost my phone because it stopped working and when I went home I told the whole story to my parents, they got mad at me. They said, ""how can you be so irresponsible and why you used your phone while doing a lab thats why you have bad grades in the class and so on."" As you have read, using cell phones in the classroom is not a good idea because many students will stop working. They wont do anything because students are addicted to their phones. Using cell phone is not beneficial because we lose the ability of working and focusing. Using phone wont make anyone smart, if they focus on doing work or listen to teacher that will make them smart and responsible people. Education is the key of success and taking that key will make you work hard.",9,8,8,8,9,9,436,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Both of these classes will help each other and you will have background knowledge. The school is basically trying to help you by doing this method.

424,3552,C93925EDB882,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote a quote that has Inspired me,""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". I truly agree with this quote because it demonstrates who you really are by doing hard work,everyone has something to give to the world and it is important for self esteem. By doing a lot of hard work and not giving up, it demonstrates to people who you really are, that you are a person who is determined to get where they want to be and who preservers no matter what the chanlleges are. People may or may not agree with what want you want to do, their are always going to be someone who is going to try to bring you down emotionaly, physically or mentally but you have to show them that you are going to be yourself and do what whatever it needs to take to accomplish it. This reminds me of myself because in my senior year of High School I didnt have enough credits in order to graduate that really got my family disappoint that the time I was going to an online school and it was harder for me to make up for all the classes but I saw how my own family started to put me down and it did hurt my feelings but that used that feeling to pick myself up and work everyday on the classes to be able to graduate on time. This showed people and most importantly it showed me that im capable of showing people who I really am by doing hardwork. I think everyone has a lot to offer to this world, you never know who will be the next person to discover a cure for a illness that people thought it was terminal. Everyone is capable of doing what there heart desires it just take determination, hard work and desire to accomplish what you want. People should not listen to what others say it only matters what you know that you can accomplish and that you believe in yourself that is all it takes to became and be where you want to be. My plans after High School is to go to college to become a ultrasound technician. I speak two languages Spanish and English and I believe because I speak two languages fluently I have something to give to the world, to the community and to any one in need. I know my own family wanted me to be a lawyer to help people with immigration lawsuits and for a while I started to consider following my parents dream of me being a lawyer to make them happy but my passion for the medical field was bigger and from my knowledge a big percent of pregnant women are Hispanic and as a person who speaks Spanish very well,I think I could help out people who dont know English in order to get the resources they need. Being yourself and showing the world what you are capable of shows the world that you believe in yourself and it is important for your self esteem too because it makes you feel good about yourself and most of time your going to be alone doing your own stuff, taking care of your business. You can not always depend on people to get you what you need, to get you where you want to be. I remember when I moved out of my parents house with my son and having my own room, my own space and paying bills made me feel so good about myself. I finally felt like I was doing something for myself because my parents wanted to keep me at home but I managed to get through everything and anything while living on my own and It made me more independent person and it helped me boost my energy and believe in myself. Nevertheless, Author Ralph Waldo Emerson quote ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"". This quote has reminded that you should truly believe in yourself, be yourself, do hard work and it will motivate you to be where you want to be. I think this quote has a lot of different meanings and I think it depends on your own personal experiences and It has honestly helped me a lot through my teenage year and overall my biggest accomplishment was to follow my heart and be who I really want to be in life just like the Ralph Waldo Emerson said.

425,3553,4462E068017D,This prompt is asking if they should reduce summer vacations because they think its hard for students to retain informartion easily after a long break. Summer you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school. You can travel to different places or countrys to see your love ones if you havent seem them in a long time. Summer is like enjoy myself time because you can do things you cant do while you are in a school year because its a short time but summer is like two months break. Students can go to retake classes during the summer if they fail and they want to recover a credit for a class. Students that play sports would have more fun enjoying playing it because they dont have to worry about anything but stay in shape for their sports and they have more time to play sports. For the students that like to read a lot they have a lot of time to their self and can spend major of their time at the library reading tons of books. Students that like to travel a lot they can anywhere and later they can write journal or take pictures and tell their classmates how their summer went. Bad things if they reduce summer break will be more school time. People wouldnt be able to go places because they have to attent to school and they would have to worry a lot. Most people would be stress from school if they dont have a long break like summer. Summer wouldnt be fun for students because thats when they all gather together and they have fun and enjoy theirselfs. I think the school boards should not reduce summer break because you can travel with your family to different places and have fun and not to worry about school things. Students should have summer break after months of been at school and they can take their stress out during the big break and focus on other things outside of school.

426,3554,9532BA8E40BA,"why is better to have summer break than have it in different time of the year? Some educators feel that the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall,and some people argue that should be year-round schools, where there would be a 3-4 weeks break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I disagree that students should have a year-round schools because students will not learn if they have many breaks during the year, students would not have enough time with their families, and friends, also students would have hard time to do their work. First, Students will not learn if they have many breaks. I think that is better if students have summer break than have it in different sections of the year. for example; if students want to travel to other state for vacations they would have to travel a week before so they can have fun, but students have to come back a week before school start, and they will forget what have they been learning the pass months. the main point of this example is that there is no point of doing a year-round schools, because that would affect students. second, students would not have enough time with their family, and friends. Students travel every summer to other states to visit their families, and friends. for example; Most of the students travel every summer to other states or countries, but if students have year-round schools they will not have enough time to have fun with their families, and friends, also they would make less plans, because students would have to come back a week before the school start. from this example the main point is that students should have their vacations in the summer, and not in different sections of the year because they take time to those students, and when they go back to school they will not make any effort to do what they suppose to do. third, students would have hard time to do their work. they would not have enough time to complete their worksheets from school, because they were having fun with their families, and friends in other countries. for example; if most of the students travel to different countries or states, and when they come back home students will be tired, and lazy to do their work, but if they have summer vacations they will be exited to go to school, retain information as easily when they come back. from this example the main point is that students should have summer vacations so they can be exited when they come back to school, and be great during the school. finally, students would be more time in the school learning more, and paying attention to the teachers, also they will get their work done more faster, and students would be more positive to pass their SOLS. Although students would be more successful in school. ",5,5,6,5,5,6,1974,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
427,3555,BF56324B3A86,"Do you know how many people are unhappy for be someone that they dont are?. At the present time in the world exist millions of people that dont live their life of the way that they want. Sometimes is difficult be yourself in a world where the whole people think that be different is wrong, but the truth is that the greatest accomplishment in the life of each human is be unique and have individuality in all your presence, because be yourself is the goal of the happiness, fight against the prejudice of everyone is not easy and accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. Many people think that have a success and amazing life is have a lot of money, be an important person or have material things but all this things in really dont matter in the process of be yourself, because a person can have all this things but this things dont define you like a person and this aspects dont give the happiness, and something very important in the life of everyone is that, if you dont have happiness you dont have nothing. Is a fact that at least the 60 percent of people is not happy with their life, but studies affirm that this can change just if they choose be hones with themselves and take out of their life want they dont want. And the first step to be happy is be yourself. The people dont can live being liar with themselves, because this just bring like consequence a miserable life. A person have to accept their personality and their interest based on their thoughts. A serious consequence that the people get if they dont be honest with themselves are diseases like depression, This is a very dangerous problem and one of the most common causes are dont be agreeable with the person or the way that the person is living. For this and many others reasons is that is very difficult be yourself but is the biggest reward. Alongside of your life you have to make a lot of decisions and is important always hear you. The people cannot allow that someone take decisions for they if that affect who are they. First is very important know exactly what do you want because that is the same that be happy with yourself. Always take your own opinion first, is the answer of be really happy because is very easy follow the opinion of the others based in their lifes or be influenced for a world that always is trying to make you someone else, someone that they dont are. But at the end what a person want is the answer of be really happy. Everyone in the world is trying to find their correct way in their life, and be honest about feelings and all mentioned in this paragraph can be the answer to arrive to the goal and be happy with yourself. Is a fact that actually the world is a constantly war, because the majority of the citizens in the world are trying to fight for their rights and be honest with themselves and also with the whole world. But is true that this is not a easy task. The only person that someone need worry about what they going to think is yourself!, a person dont have to worry about the opinion of the others, just care what do you think!. Unfortunately, not everyone understand this, and sometimes the people wants that the world accept us form the simple fact of be a person. Is very hard be like you really are if millions of people want change your mind and they refuse to accept that everyone is different, that there are things that dont have that be equal and that its fine, that the diversity is part of a balance. Everyone is here, in their country, in their community to learn about the others, and have respect of they, dont care their race, color, language, traditions, customs and many others things that represent and define a person, this is the correct, not be equal. Nowadays a lot of people is trying to make this world a better place where the prejudices not exist and where each person can be what they want and have the rights that the people need and deserve. Is a difficult battle but without doubt the result is the greatest accomplishment. And is a fact that if the people are happy with how they are, and they accept their form of be, with their qualities and defects, anyone, and studies repeat that anyone can affect you, because you are really on the top of the goal and when you are there nothing can make you go down. Many philosopher and researchers believe that the problem with the society that dont accept and allow the people that is different, is because since the beginning of the world the people hidden their really feelings and interests for the fear of be rebounded. In part is own fault because the people never said something when something was wrong, but never is late, an actually the majority of the people is trying to change the perspective about what is fine in the world. That is why accept you exactly like you are, looks like a war if the whole world is trying to change you. We have to be strong and dont allow that anyone dispute your decisions. Another reason therefore is hard be yourself is for you, sometime the people are so exigent with themselves, you are your own most hard critical. If everyone would honest with themselves , this would be something normal for the society, but is such difficult accept us, that is seen wrong be unique. We definitely have to change this way of see the circumstances and make it normal. Is clearly that we have a lot of learn but I think that we going to the correct way. The people have to travel many obstacles for win their individuality and always remember where we are and where we want arrive. Be yourself, is really difficult if a whole society is telling you that you can not be different and that be unique is wrong, because how you can understand who are you, if anyone give you the chance to know it, but without doubt discover the answer will be the best accomplishment that a person can have because live being you, is the better that could exist, for a complete life.

428,3556,D15E85D292CE,"""Cell phones"", for the main statement I must evacuate cell phones in school time. Students are often breaking ""expectations"" about using your cell phone in class. But some schools choose to use cell phones for educational purposes only during that time. Now, we should be able to see why cell phones are doing to the students of any school. Cell phones may disrupt students work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious. Cell phones may disrupt students work. This may happen when students play games or text in their cell phones. Probably when students might make them less focus on their work just checking social media. Students of many ages have trouble enough with their homework and also classwork. May cell phones be causing this to begin with? Maybe, just so we know cell phone may disrupt students work. Cell phones may make them feel misplaced. What I mean for that is a student just be on their cell phones a lot, an student may just feel better on their phone instead of doing work. which makes the student disconnect with class time. Not even using it to complete work making a opinion sound like a fact. As we know cell phones may make them feel misplaced. Cell phones may make them rebellious. Another meaning by this is to disrespect authority. ""Authority"" means the staff of the school of any kind of departments. Some students in blood are rebellious, but not the man made kind. They may feel furious when criticize for anything done on phone. They may feel like that anytime with the main disturbance of the classroom. So cell phones make them rebellious. Next,our argument against cell phones is extremely important to all others expect the students. Students will fight back other supporters of the opposite answer hes been fighting against. My counter argument settles the fact cell phones are not good in class room for any time. Now, students would be more efficient without cell phones than with cell phones. So, this has settled against everyone. In conclusion, Students think their doing a great work with a cell phone in deck. But in reality, it is making you more and more dependent with your mind. But many people actually learn from it. Either you have a learning style or make great grades with cell phones must see the negatives of this. Other students using cell phones may disrupt students work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious.",8,6,7,6,6,6,2893,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

In my opinion, 1. we can accomplish more if we stay active, 2. Activities helps us gain knowledge and expiriences, 3. We build self-steam and confidence in ourselves. First, we can discover and implement more if we can stay active. For example, we have a higher rate of winning if we are pertinacious.

For example you go to the store and get groceries the total would be whatever money it is and youl pay but you need to know how much math you have to do. What if you know how to do math and you need a lot of help to count an amount of a number and if theres no one to help you have to use a calculator and other things.

Everyone can learn in different ways but a better option its by attending normal classes. People have the option to choose whith what they feel comfortable. Attending to regular classes gives the opportunity to pick their own classes. We can have many benefits by this. If students attend to regular schools they have the opportunity to meet new people, to participate at clubs and they have the chance to talk and get help from teachers. Students who attend normal schools have the opportunity to meet new people. Not everyone likes to be anti-social and to be alone without not knowing others. Sometimes is great to have a person that we can tell everything. By going to school, we have the chance to talk to a thousand of people and to make new friends. Once Generic_Name got the options to pick home school or to attend to normal classes. She chose to do classes at home. She was happy for the idea that she has not to wake up early. For the first couple of weeks everything was fine. She was getting use to it. One day she realized that she has no friends; she feels alone. Generic_Name when to talk to her mom about the way she was feeling. Her mom told her that if she werent pick to stay at home and doing distance learning; she werent to feel that way. Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends. Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs. While distance learning dont have activities or clubs for students to do. Public schools have different kind of activities or clubs that they can enjoy. Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football. They might like to form part of the football team and thats what normal schools provides. If this person form part of a football team; he can get scholarships to participate in big leagues. From clubs students can get an idea of what career they want to get in the future, to discover new things, and to get experience from this different activities. Other might argue that distance learning gives students time for their jobs, they can avoid being getting in trouble and they can take care of their youngest siblings while they are at home. However, people by attending to classes have the chance to get help from teachers. Its a reality that not everyone is capable to understand easily. Sometimes we need a push or help from others who knows about the things we dont. The awesome thing about normal schools is that teachers stay a little longer after school to help with hard work. To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or its really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them. Talking to teachers helps to understand because they give us a deeply explanation. At school people have the chance to make new friends, to have the oppoortunity to try new activities and to improve academically with the help of teachers. Some people can be in disagreement with public schools, but they have on mind that sometimes it can be a better option. School its a good way to get out of home for at least some hours. Not everyone likes to being at home for the whole day. At school we can have fun with our friends, lunch time is unique and that is something the distance learning dont offer. Activities after school are a good way to keep people out of trouble. To help them to choose a good path. School have a variety of ways to have fun, not just by playing, also by learning.

Did you know that 50% of the population of older student have often fail because of lack of communication and the other half is lack of knowledge. I believed, If older student help the younger kids they will they both will succeed in different things. For example, communicating more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often. For the younger ones they will understand their conflict and what they need to work on. Learning to communicate more helps the older student talk to the younger ones more often.

I understand why I was wrong and what I need to do in order to get it right. From my point of view I knew he was having trouble communicating with me because he was studding a lot and made mistakes.

So my teacher got me an assist too help me with the calculation so I dont mess up again. Eventually, I pass the class with a B-, I was relief that it was over and I wont do that chemical bond ever again."" Often successes can help both young and older student.

That it is okay if you made a mistake, but make sure that you dont know something dont leave it blank just try and figure out what missing because the assist wont be there all ways. Life dosent work like that, their are thing that we have to figure out on our own. My job is teach you what the problem that your stuck on and me learning how to communicate with others and you learning your problems, and trying to fix them.""I remember when I got my license at the age 21 and yes that means I crash a lot, turning in the wrong direction, and even broken into people yards. Yes, it really hard driving and I had this final attempt that if I dont pass then I dont ever get my license even when I really old. So I study hard and where im I supposed to go, stop when the light is red, Break when something is moving in the road, read the speed limit, park in a specific position ,and most importantly turn on the signal. I had an assist or should I say my friend Generic_Name, was with me and telling me what to do. I thought I was going to crash in to someones yard again but not this time, I was driving pretty go actually .So the day had come and I need to relaxed and not think about failing, and them my family will laugh at me for not passing, and I had to live with my parents all the time just because I cant drive. I stared to do go and the instructor showing me where to turn. After a few hours had passed I barely had passed with a C- and that not to go and not to bad. I had my license and my life was going go too. To sum it all up, all over the world school have a program called ""Two is better than One"" it a program that allows older student assist the younger student in order for them to succeed in the conflicts there having trouble on It helps both old and younger students. It helps the older student to communicate more with people and so on and so forth. When the older student learn how to communicate with others they with eventually learn to help or talk to strangers more often. Failure can eventually lead to successes, like my driving license, I fail lots of times but that never stop me from getting my driving license. From that chemistry class that I almost took the whole school down with me. From that final attempt I learn that no matter how many time you fall there will always be a way to succeed. But there will be time were you need someone assist so they can help you. Did you have a difficult time on something and ask someone to help you or fail at a test and the teacher have you an assist in order for you to pass it again?

435,3563,D6C9DE61BAF4,"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons. Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people dont do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person. Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you. Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they dont pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and thats why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.",6,5,6,7,5,7,2997,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

440,3568,DDC3C4A828DA,"It has been said that first imperssions are almost impossible to change, do you agree or disagree? In my past experience, I would highly disagree with this statement. When first meeting somebody, you dont always get the right thoughts about that specific person. Once knowing somebody personally your thoughts start changing, your mind starts messing up on thinking ""What should I think about this person?"". Due to my past experience I always have luck to my first opinion changing to a good opinion after getting to know them. I always ask my friends what were there thoughts of me when they met me for the very first time and all of my friends would always tell me that I look like I was mean and not very kind. After, theyre opinions later changed once they got to me personally, knowing my personality and knowing how kind I am. My friends were very suprised. Second, I would insists of not always having a first opinion on when seeing somebody for the first time because that usually is never how the person actually is. First imperssions always depend on the person on how there feeling or just based of anything that can be said. Second impressions always get more better once they seen each other at least ones. Third, I would like to speak on my past experiences with this statement on why I disagree with this reasoning. When I was a couple years younger I had some very means thing said about me in middle school due to a couple of very mean people. Due to those sayings and rumors a various amount of people knew about me and the stuff that was said about me. People thought they already know me through thick and thin but in reality they really didnt. Once, I wanted to meet new people they never actually really wanted to speak to me or actually meet me because they already had there first impression because of the sayings. Later on, years started passing by and a few people started meeting me more and started speaking to me and once they did they noticed that I was very different person then what people would say about me. In Conclusion, In my past experience I would highly think in my beliefs I would defiendely not based my first impression on somebody Im just meeting. I like to get treated on how I treat others. First impressions are never good thats why its never good to get based off that. Youve read my about my past and now know why I dont go off that.

Another example is sometimes these activities can help them relax and keep them calm so they stay out of trouble. Another reason is some of the activities can keep them healthy. For example students can do football or basketball which keeps them running and keeps them in good shape. They can also do lift training after school which keep them fit and all around healthy. Last but not least these activities are fun. There are always a lot of activities and you can always find something you like. For example if you like sports there are so many different sports you can do. There are also other things like drama club if you like acting, art club if you like drawing, even robotics club if you like technology and stuff like that.

Churchchills is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do. If you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you dont know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can. Make a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well Im still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didnt know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I didt know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things. I was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they dont speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life. I believe that if you fail, try to do it again. Do what makes you happy and succed in your life.

If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then its acceptable because its a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences dont work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they dont try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where youre supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place.

She teaches me how to cook some basic but delicious plates. I think Learning from the experience of others is better because they been alive longer and know a lot about the topic like cooking, playing a sport, Driving, swimming or teaching they study or practice a lot that they became masters at it. They also been a live longer and knows how it works. Like my grandma she is good at cooking so I press attention to her cooking and see what new things I learn. An Example is when you are a teenager you want to buy the best of the best pair of shoes to show your friends that you got something that they done But if your parents say to not buy them and to save the money instead to buy something better and more special later in life like a car there is were we should press attention to what they say about spending money because they are older there brain is fully developed and they know what to save for because they are older and have been here longer and know how to use money.

Which mean schools have one month of summer and a longer winter break. Nevertheless I think schools should not be year round schools because summer have a very hard weather also students use this time to plan some trip with family and friends. Summer has a very hard weather to even think go to schools. Some day the temperature goes to 96c or more this is to hot for students. This hot temperature will make students swearing a lot and have very hard head hurt during class time level of streets will increase make students get bad grades or be angry all this time. Students who work in hot areas will feel more difficult to do a simple thing than students who work in a warm area . Hot areas make you not focus in your work. In summer students have 2 months to enjoy make some family trip or things like that .Some students and families take this time to make some big family vacation plan. students wait for this time of the year to do their vacations. Because summer is a perfect time to go to the beach with family and friends or go outside the country to visit other country as we do not have school in summer we do not miss any day of school . trip can take so much time and students think summer is a perfect time to do. In summer students have enough time do anything students want some students use this time to find a job during summer as students do not have school they are more focus making money,so summer is very important to us to have some time with our family or make money.

The school could make a slald bar for those who chose to eat it and they could add there own toppings so they could eat somthing they like instead of throwing it out.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldnt do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I dont agree for these reasons: First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they cant do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldnt do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things. Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because its not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too. Finally, In Summer break the students dont worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they dont have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they dont need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got. Some persons may dont agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they dont got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest. In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldnt do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for. So Summer break needs to stay like that and is the best season for students so they can enjoy and have fun in their long break.",8,7,6,6,5,6,2662,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
450,3578,9B4C52064991,"Have you wondered why local companies and organizations plus the different schools doesnt add up well this will answer why? This prompt will try to figure out the answer of this question. These local companies and organizations that allow students from different schools should interact certain professions. Teachers and students can think of organization that allow other schools to join in that profession. I think i should do is help the students that needed help with the organization they wanted. If the employer wants me to visit I will say this if i get accepted for this job first of all thank you second is you probably want to go to my office. I chose this job is because I like to help other people with what they really need not want but need. Students should create new professions in the future so then the future students can access the professions that the students from the past did the same with teachers. The local companies can grow even bigger if they needed to. Some local companies and organizations hate students because they touch very expensive, valuable, dangerous items plus they dont even pay any attention to you. Others can be totally calm about it. They actually answer some of your questions, listen to you for once not faking it.

451,3579,D5AC4A35BAF8,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, "" Determine never to be idle. . It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". When he wrote the quote "" Its wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing,"" hes referring that when we always do tasks, assignments,or other things, Its a wonderful feeling knowing that we could complete or finish the tasks if we were always doing something. I believe that when someone work hard or try their best on what theyre instersted about they could accomplish their goals. When setting up goals, we want to accomplish them in the furture. By accomplish our goals we have to keep working harder and focus closely until we could reach our goals. Get ideas how you could accomplish your goals; for a example , by particupating schools programs ,or other smalls groups that could help you reach your goals. Keep praticing on what youre instersted about because we accomplish more by always doing something repeatly. Always be positive on reaching your goals and always try something new beacuase you wont know if you good at something else that you never knew before or try before. Most of time we dont accomplish anything its because we not trying or we dont really care about finishing or completing anything. Sometimes always doing something repeating doesnt help for some people, since it may not work out for them. If your other goals is not working out for you, you could try something else thats new or challening. Accomplish something is not only for goals, but you could accomplish your tests, chores, group activity, and more others. Most of times people want to accomplish short-term or long-term goals because theyre the most important things that they want to accomplish in their list. Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or not ? Yes, we do accomplish more when we always doing something because if we keep repeatly doing something for kinda long period we will accomplish it and accomplish more goals too that we want to achieve too.

452,3580,CD4135EAFB1E,"A Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow. Some will said youll grow but wont reach their beyond what they mastered. Some will disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson statement, because doing something beyond that already master will never stop you from doing it. In the pass year I played a Villain before I reach goal becoming beyond with a instrument that I didnt know how to play, I master how to soccer for the first when I was little, and at the end of the day your going to be beyond great when you dont give up. When I was 6th grade in middle school I never though I was going to learn how to play instrument for the first time in my life. The instrument that Im now play is Villain my brother though I wasnt good enough to play a instrument. I practice every days to get better and to try my best. I played three year in middle school I was getting good and then I love how sound made with bows and string. The teacher once said if stop playing then your going to forget the string note and how to used correctly. When I got to middle I learned how to play a interment for the for time in my life become beyond. I didnt stop growing I kept growing to become better to play. Why wont we reach our goal then become beyond because doing something beyond your reaching a goal to finish. This was a time where I want to learn how to play a sport. When I was little I wanted to play soccer but I didnt started learning until I was 10 years old. My goal was to learn how to play soccer, until one day I was at the park with my family and friend I learn how to play soccer. My uncle tough me how to played soccer for the first time. He showed me how to kick the inside and outside of my feet. My uncle told me that I was fast learner that I kicked correctly with forced. So we played soccer just kicking back and forth until knew how to kick. When I was 7th grade I sign up for the girl soccer team for the school. When I made the team I was exacted because I never though I going play for school soccer team and it was the first to play. The couch liked how I played but my friend though I was beyond great but I didnt believe them. When I got to 8th grade I wanted to sign up again because some of my friend was joining, then when I made in the team next then I know they voted for me to become captain for the girl soccer team. The coach was beyond how I played for the game I made 8 goal in the season but I never stopped playing soccer. Until the moment in my life I knew that I had master my goal. Im 16 year old about to turn seventeen in July I have reach so many goals in my life and then it when beyond. I learn so many thing on my own because my parent didnt know English. At the end of day I had teacher and friends that help me all my school year. The one key that my parent tough me was never give up on yourself, if you dont understand the problem then go to the next problem then come back to finish the rest. So all this year I learn how to play a instrument that was a villain and playing a sport that love I become beyond great and master to become better.

453,3581,E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you wont grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing? First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldnt you want to challenge yourself with new things? Its good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things. Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You cant master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good. Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be. However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you dont work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you dont do that than you would struggle a lot in life. In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and dont want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because youre going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldnt it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",8,6,7,7,7,7,3396,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
454,3582,5F4D9997A207,"Students Early Graduation Do you think that finishing the high school in three year helps a student to enter the university or work force one year earlier? As we know education is so important in our life and every one need to get good educate. Therefore, we need to study well to get good grades. It dosent matter to finish high school in three year or four year. Therefore, students need to be active, hard working, and patient about the opportunities that school prepare for them. Those student who are active in the class and participate in the lessons, they will graduate on time with a good grades thats why they dont need to do these following steps; work force one year, not having elective classes, and taking summer classes. Also, some students by taking serious the home works and completing the class work can rise their score and that helps them to do not fail on the test and no west one more year to study that subject again otherwise by failing it effect badly for their graduation year. I think the best way to solve this problem is to be as a good memmber of class and participate in schools lessons. students with hard working can get good scores in the class and that scores helps them to be a better student in future. Even I am a student I can say that for sure that you will never lose something by trying hard and some times maybe the result will not pleasant but you should never give up and never lose hopes. For example; the student who never try hard for learning and they just come to class even they do not pay attention in lessons, these type of student will not pass the exmes and in the future they will face with lots of problem like taking classes during summer, not having elective classes. I know a lots of students who just had good score and pass their exmas and graduate without any rush. Most of student need to be patient about the educational desitions because that desition could change their hole life. Finishing the high school early is not the point everyone knows that studying well and learning something in best way is important part of education. Although, high school students are teen and they have more time so they dont need to rush for graduating. Also, In my old school I knew a girl who wants to finish the high school sooner because she think that the faster you finish the faster you will be able to start the colloge but, that was not good idea so she undastand it later. students need to be active, hard working, and patient about the opportunities that school prepare for them and if the lost these opportunities they will never get it back so, use from the time you have it right now before you lost it.",6,5,6,7,6,5,1230,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

In my opinion I do think it is key towards success, and the reasons why I think this is one finding a good career, second is meeting new people in a good way. In life you need money to pay bills and in order to get money for your bills is to get career, a good one at least, and everyone knows that you need a resume, a good skill that your going to work for, and a good/positive attitude to help you get the job. you people may wonder ""why need to have a positive attitude to get your job?"" well you want to impress and increase your rate of the person that is considering to hire you or not, also if start talking in a boring way the person might not hire you. The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never in a negative way. meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage theyll treat you the some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so thats why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention or you just like treating people positive because thats your nature. I know how this world works and to survive the world of negativity is to be negative as well to survive this world, however that isnt the way to live and nobody likes to do negative things as well as they cant hold it for long time and end up taking away their own life, so staying positive is a great way to live in life. The conclusion I am trying to give at out is that being positive is the a great way live instead of living in a way of negativity since being negative is way to tough to live out and positively gives you joy and give more paths to walk through and thats what I think a key to success means.",8,7,7,7,7,7,2448,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

457,3585,344D7B1A7E49,"I agree with Emersons statement. Why would some people never grow up? Some people may have childish personality so its most likely that the person wont be able to change much. The three reasons are: your attitude, violence, and lastly friends that some people are using you and say some harsh things when your not around. Some may say that some people will be able to change. They are wrong because some people wont be able to change how they act towards you. My first reason is attitude: some people wont be able to change to change your attitude towards them, and wont be able to change how you act towards them. For example, I sometimes have a very bad attitude towards my sister, Generic_Name. I always yell at my sister, Generic_Name for asking me to do something or give her something even though shes younger than me by three years. My second reason is violence: Some people wont be able to change their violence, and some people my end up hurting their closest friends. For example, back in middle school I was always a sweet girl who doesnt hurt people, but after, when I cut my hair some people end up calling me names which made me upset and I started to get a little violent towards the people who call me names. Im still sweet towards my friends who understands how I feel when someone call me names, but I also try very hard to control my violence so I wont get in trouble. The second example is: My youngest sister, Generic_Name gets violent when my other sister, Generic_Name gets her angry. Afterwards, she tries very hard not to get violent just like me. My last reason is friends: Some people wants to use you for money because they wanted to buy clothes only for themselves. The other one is some people will act nice, but, when you leave they will say very cruel things to you. For example, I watch my favorite movie where the popular, mean girls are acting friendly to the new girl, but when the new girl leaves the popular, mean girls say harsh things about her so the new girl wont be able to hear them. In conclusion, why would some people never grow up? The way the person is acting childish would make them not change that much. I agree with Emersons statement, because some people can be very childish, and its most likely wont be able to change that much. The three reason are: some people have a very bad attitude, sometimes get very violence, and lastly some people may use you and say very cruel things about you when your not there.",7,8,7,6,6,8,678,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

460,3588,0EBED6896F51,"Would you choose to fail for somebody elses ideas and not your own? Although some say that people should seek guidance from people that have experience about life because they have become more wise with the years, actually people should make their own decisions because you already know what you want for your life and if you fail will be for your own decision and not on somebody else. Some say that people should seek guidance from experts that have experience about life because they have become wise with the years. Old people like my grandfather for example, he always told me that the best way to accomplish something you really want is by giving the best of us and not wait for other people to do it for you because that is not going to happen. In reality people should make their own decisions about what to do with their lives because you already have an idea about how you really want to be or what you want for your life to be in the future. When my brother was about to finish high school he tried to get an advice from somebody about what to do with his life, but my father was always working and my mom had not experience about life because she had taken some bad decisions in life. So my brother had to follow his instincts and take a decision in his own. Now he graduated from high school and he started an academy to be a police officer one day. Some people say that it is better to fail by taking our own decisions and not fail because of decisions that other people take for us. I still remember my aunt Generic_Name she always wanted to be a cloth designer but she did not take her own decision and now she is still working and making some more money then a cloth designer, but she is not completely happy with her job because she followed some other people ideas and she did not think on what she really wanted for her life. In conclusion it is better to follow your ideas because that way we will do what we really want for our lives and not what other people tell you to do even if they haven more experience sometimes is just better to follow your instincts. Seek guidance from experts that have a lot of experience about life is not always the best thing to do because if you follow their ideas you will not work on what you want.

463,3591,8778DE7C8D0E,"introduction The people who value selft-reliance should seek guidance from experts and authorities, instead of taking their own decision about lifes important matters. When we say experts we are talking about people that know alot more about the topic then us. We can compare this an a teacher and student. The teachers they have graduated from what they know lets say science class. They have to do alot to become a teacher in that career. This is why I say that if we value self-reliance we need help from experts. that way we can subcess in life. However there is some decision that we can take by ourself. For example, we can choose if we want to drink alcohol, and smoke. for that type of decision we just have to think about who we are hurting too, and as we know it is ourself and nobody else. if we dont take about ourself and the decision thaty we make nobody will. Reason 1 In my opinion self-reliance is really important in every single person life. When we talk about Self-reliance is about decision. There is times that we think we are right in every decision that we make. However, we have to know that no one is perfect as a human. So, there is times where we make bad choices. One good example could be when we are tenergers. at that age is when we need more help than anything because there is alot of things that can influenciate us really easy. At that time is when we need help from experts and what better experts then our parents. They want the best for us, so they will teach us what could be the best and what have to really matter is this life because they love us. Im not talking and general because there are some parents that dont really care about what his son or her dauther are doing, but some of them do. Also, we can look for another type of experts who can be profesional and have a diploma in what they are experts in. So, it can be really helpful for us to subceed because they have been studying for years their career. Also, it can help us to make better decison trought life and make us a better person. Reason 2 Bad decison can hurt ourself. decison is something that we all have to make one day. it could be good or bad decision or sometimes there are some decision that look good, but it could take us to do something bad. However ther are decison that cna hurt ourself and can take us to do something stupid in life. For example, a person want to nibest money to create a restaurant. At first it sound good because what we all think is that we only win in this type of business, but the reallity is that it could be like a challange for the person. some people dont take sometime to think about the consecuences of creating a restaurant. They dont think about the things that they have to pay out from the money that they are making of the restaurant. They dont think about that they can lose all their money if the restaurant doesnt work. When it happens that people lose all their money they can get depress, and some of them have even take their life. So, here is when we need the help from experts and not take the decison of creating the restaurant by ourself. Those people that we call experts know alot more then us because they have graduated from it. They know everyhting about business and what could be best for us. So, we can subcess in business life and dont lose money. counterclima. Someone would argue that making decison by ourself is better because that way we wont have to blame on anybody if we make bad decision. Also, we can learn how to be responsable in the decison that we make.

464,3592,F3259CFA6566,"Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not. Sometimes its good to change in your life but dont loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person. Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. You dont have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you cant really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out dont want to be the person everyone talks about. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that. Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they wont care who you are or what you are. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself dont change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". Be you dont push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you havent brought out yet. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already. Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. Dont be someone youll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you werent supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. You also cant be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person. Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. Youve changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. Who you chose to be will be that same person youll possibly be one you are more grown into life. Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.",10,8,9,9,8,8,3603,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

People may think now that technology is out people contact other people way less but high chance thats not the case. People that do things like gaming or just connection with others online make it way easier to meet other people. For example theres websites like Omegle where you just go on and get into a voice chat with a random person around the country or maybe in other countries. Theres also many other websites or apps where you can contact random people or even friends and family. Theres also gaming, for gamers you usually go into lobbies or servers with thousands of people which is also an easier to contact people. For example if you own a PC, a PlayStation, or even an Xbox theres many games where you can contact people if youre making new friends or even just playing with them for as long until someone gets off. I have heard many stories where people have met online and grew a friendship even though theyve never met in person they probably have each others social media and numbers. Many people use technology to shop. Online shopping is an easier way of finding things you need or even things you want. People commonly do online shopping only because its just easier and quicker. Some people may have a busy schedule so it will make things easier if theyre running errands or even just going out and spending time with family or friends without having to add something else to their list of plans. Online shopping is probably something everyone has done multiple times and many people can agree that it is easier and quicker than driving out to the store and searching through the whole store to find the things you want or need.

There are three reasons why students may want to take this chance. First reason is that they may need to help there family out. The second reason is that the students dont want to be in school for so long. Third reason is that the students may want to go to college at a early age to get that over with at a early age and get a good financial job.

First of all one reason that it may be good for the students to graduate early because they may need to help out there families. The students parents may work but they need that extra help for their kid. Because, they are not financially good with money. So graduating a year early may help the students help out there familys. If students need to help there families out and they finish with school early they dont have to worry about having to go to school they can just work so that they can help there families out. Another reason is that the students want to graduate school early because they dont want to be in school for so long. Students sometimes just want to start making money so they want to get over with school. They may have a job but the part-time may not get them a lot of money. So if they finish school in three years they can start working at a full-time job early and start making the money that they really want to make. Students would love to finish school in three years because they dont want to keep on going to school.

473,3601,9DBCBFD45366,"Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make better choices because they can get different perspective from other people, more option to choose from, and other ways to solve problem. Things can go really bad sometimes if someone doesnt ask for more than one option to choose from. First of all, getting different perspective from other people is anther reason for someone to ask for multiple opinions. Lets say Generic_Name was going to the mall, but when she got there she didnt know where this on store that she really wanted to go was. She asked a dude where it was and the dude said "" In the second floor"". She went to the second floor and did not find the store so she asked another person and other person said ""Its on the first floor next to the ice cream shop"". She went down to the first floor and went next to the ice cream shop got an ice cream and found the store. Generic_Name was so happy she found that store because if she had it asked the other person she would never had found the store. Second of all, having more than one opinion is better right?. For example lets say Generic_Name moved to New York and it was her first day of high school, she had know clue where her school was nether her parents. Generic_Name parents told her to just walk to school and see where other students where going. She saw this girl with blue eyes and brown hair, "" ""She looks like a high school"" Generic_Name said, so she ran up to the girl and asked ""Hey whats your name"" Generic_Name she said Im in high school what about you"" ""Oh same"" Generic_Name said. When they got in the school Generic_Name had to go in a complete different way and Generic_Name was complete lost again. However, While Generic_Name was walking in the hallway she was asking a bunch of people to see where she had to go. She got multiple answers saying to go to the same place. See asking multiple opinion is better than one because what happen if she only had asked one person they could had been room and she could had gone to the wrong room. Lastly, Another reason why seeking multiple opinion is good, is because it can solve problems. For example, Generic_Name was having a sleepover with two friends. They were making food in the kitchen when her mom told her not to. While they were having fun cooking the oven caught on fire. Generic_Name was finking out she didnt know what to do ""AHHHHHH WHAT SHOULD I DO"" she said freaking out. One of her friends said call 911 while on the other hand her other find told her just trow water it will be fine your so dramatic. Generic_Name decide that calling 911 was the smartest or lets say better idea. 911 came and solved the problem. Overall, seeking multiple options can help someone make better choice by getting different perspective from other people, more options to chose from and can solve problems. Generic_Name found the mall she had to find, she found the place had to go and her house didnt burn down. Lets just say somethings really bad could had happen if Generic_Name didnt ask for more than one opinion.",9,7,7,7,7,6,2099,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

475,3603,4E13812BC1ED,"Meet new people and make new friends is fun. Having social relationships; is a good way to have a good community. Always, when we see new people that we are about to meet, we have first impressions- ideas, feelings or opinions about a person based on the superficial. For some people, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, I disagree with this statement, because this can change by: introducing each other, know more about favorite things, and ask questions about their life, then our first impressions will change. When a person is about to meet another person, they act differently as they are in their daily life, which is totally fine, because they are going to introduce each other and it will change. One day, when I was in my freshman year, I was really nervous and exciting at the same time, and this because I did not know anyone at the school, but I meet one girl; she was really kind and friendly. So, we introduce each other, and my first impression before introduce each other was, that she was serious and shy. The importance of this, is that our first impression can change after introducing each other, because we can have an idea of how the person is, based on their look or way to act, but this idea can be totally different after cross a few words each other. Furthermore, a good way to change our impression is knowing more about the other person, know about their favorite things such as hobbies, sports, and others; putting this in practice it can change the way of thinking of both persons. In my way of thinking about the impressions, these can be bad or good impressions, and a personality is part of the impression because it shows the behavior of a people. So, it is important to know more about the person; about their personality and by this could have a clue about the personality of the person. Finally, different person has a something important in their life, and that is what makes special to a person. For example, all my friends before they know me, they think that I look shy, calm and serious before they know me, but time later these impressions change for them. They told me now ""when we saw you for the first time, we though that you was so quite and serious"". And they said this, because they know more about me and about my life now, and they think that I am a fun friend and happy, so this is what makes me special, that I always look serious, but when the people know me, they think that I am friendly and happy. And I think that always, when we see a person that we never seem before, we should think to ask about their life, because details about their life can help us to change our way of view and think about the person. Therefore, first impressions can change, they are not always accurate in the way of how the behavior of the people can be. We could think that people are as the way of their physical appearance, but that is completely wrong. In order to meet new people, we have to introduce each other, know more about them, and ask questions about their life, then we can have a clearly personality about the person. After this, our impressions would change to a positive or negative impressions. We should not trust in our first impressions about a person, we should meet the person and our first impressions will change.

Some people think that the most important thing in this world is to give people self-steem, by praising their work even if is not good at all. Others believe that it can helps people to be sure about them selves even is the rest of the pople thinks the oppositive. Still others ague that given every individual praise about what they do is the greatest accomplish people can make. People should not need others to praise their work to have self-steem, Sometimes individuals do not gonna have others to tell them how great their work is, But the person have to know if the stuff is valid or not. People do not have to depend on others peoples opinions. They need to learn skills by their own selves and know when they can fix oh make better something. At the end of the day nobody is going to try to make others feel good so people have to be successful with their own self. Althought, People need to be realistic with their own selves, If the person is smarth and they know what they are doing and they do not need anybody to correct them thats all good. If people know they are doing wrong and somebody comes to tell them that they are doing great just to make them feel great!! Do not accept that, beause people need to be honest with their selves, All people need somebody to tell them how to became better. Sometimes being honest with someone can hurt them but is the best way to help those individuals. People have to become better to feel better with what they are, And not let anyone praise somethings that can be better. Finally, Praising others peoples work even if is not great can bring them fake happiness, and make them feel proud of their selves when the work that they did is not good enough. Being fake with someone can make them to become weak, and make them to not putt effort to make it better. Thats why everybody in this world should be honest with others, Some poeple at the end of the day ended with their self-steem down, becuase somebody lied to them , And when they present theirs workss peopless opinions can hurt them really bad. Students should not need anybody to tell them how great they are doing their work to have a really good self-steem, Every individual should know when they are doing good or when they are having some problems, Every person in this world know when they can put more effort to things that they are doing wrong. People should not let anyone lied to their selves, Not everyone needs others to make them feel comfortable. Some persons like to be realistic and accept when something is wrong so they can fix it. Praise others people jobs even if is not excellent can bring them fake happiness, and thats whe worse feeling ever. Thats why all people need to know how do great things and impact others by their talent, without letting anyone hurt those endividuals at the end. -Thank you :) Att: Generic_Name, ESL student.

Such as Smooth jazz, Rock, Orchestra, Rap and much more. Pianos requires a great amount of practice and knowing all the keys to create a good music at a play with the audience amused. Professional piano players gets most peoples attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960s for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano. A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use. There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop. These three types of guitars are very different and attracts peoples taste of music because some people are different.",7,7,8,6,7,8,2773,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

First: I work in a reusturant and I always have a god attitude with the costumers for example, I now a manager how work in the reastaurent she always have a negative attitude, and I think that is not god to have a negative attitude , to have a good attitude help a lot to have a job in my oponion a think that if I have a possitive attitude I can work very well and also a think that possitive attitude that we have is because the parents of as they teach as how we can have positive attitude . second: I have some friends that they are negatives and that is not god we have always to are positives some people think that is god to have a negative attitude and is not real if we are negative we can do thinks bad , my mom always tell me dont be negative that is not good that why Im always positive, my grandma always tell me dont be negative .

482,3610,B1BF25C4C28B,"My mom always tell me "" keep going until you reach your goals, never stop"". I believe that if we are always doing something we can accomplish more than we can imagine. First of all, you should never give up on something, it might not work the first time but if we are working consistently on it, one day it will became a reality. For example, when I started 11th grade I was not doing well in Chemistry. I remember each day getting into the class and always starting with a warm-up about moles. The teacher gave us about ten minutes to solve the problems because they were easy, however; I always got almost all of them wrong. Almost all my classmates knew how to solve them, so I was too embarrassed to ask question in front of the class. My friend whos also in Chemistry, understood how to do those problems and much more about chemistry, so I asked her to help me. With her help I was able to do the problems on my own because she taught step by step on how to do them. As a result, my grades improved a lot. If Id decide to just let it passed I wouldve never been able to see how far I could have gotten get if I always keep trying. Second of all, you should always go as far as you can, never stop at on point just because you think is worthless or youre are not going to make it. For example, the women whos my manager at a fast food restaurant she started as a employee. Most of the coworkers told her that it was going to be challenging for her to be a manager .They were trying to make her stop doing something she wanted to do for her future, they told her to just stay there and see what happens next. Instead, of listening to what people were saying, she worked really hard and accomplish a lot more than she could be able of. If you really want to make something happen, you should always have to work for it, and not think it will just happen as a miracle. Third of all, some people may argue that doing something over and over again will never work, however; many people are able to prove that this statement is not true. For example, in a TV show about a girl who was always working toward getting into collage failed many times, but she never gave up. Because of her hard work and desire to keep working no matter what, one day she got accepted into a really privileged collage. By always doing something and never giving up is the key to accomplish everything. To conclude, in order to get something you should never stop working for it. Most celebrities and rich people are where theyre now because they always are doing something to make their dreams true and if at one point they had stopped I dont think they wouldve been successful. This world is full of opportunities but only those who always are working and never stopping are able to take advantage of it.

Visiting your work space can help others understand what your do. Visiting your company could help understand how things are made at your company and what your goal is for the future of your company. This visit will help me understand how the people are too. Visiting your company could help people understand what you do at your work space. Looking at a work space can help people see what the company is working on. Also at a company while they are working help people see how things are here and if they like it or not. Letting people see your work space will let them know what kind of company this is. Opening your company to people would help them understand what kind of things you need to work here. This could help chosing colleges and schools. Instead of wasting time looking all the colleges looking here could help narrow the options a bit. Knowing what course to take will help me pick what college I want and will help me narrow the list instead of looking all over the place. Letting people vistit your company would them see what your working on. Letting them come in and everything could help them know what they might be getting in the future.

484,3612,A7CEC076632B,"Technology Technology does not effect the way how people interact with another. Think about it like this, some people might just make some type of contact with another person and at the same time doing other things such as in checking your information, money status, savings, and many other things more, yet still making human contact with another. yes i think think for some a occasions it would be necessary and and really nice to make eye contact and interact with one another, for example when you are at a job interview, or even being the job interviewer. Little things like that i would consider to interact with another. Theres many other things that would be important to interact with, especaily if it has to do with yourself. Technology itself is good hepler now in days. It can help you with anything that you are in need of, thats why i say its more of a negative and positive for obvious reasons. Technology does not effect people, or the way they are getting taught. Teachnology is something good for us, helps us keep things more in order, or can hold more information insted of having paper copys all over the place. technology can be a other way of interacting with other people for example like making a phone call, or a text, or even a video call those are other ways of making contact with one another. thats why for those reasons technology isnt making an effect on us as much. Technology, so this where it could effect us. Well one it could effect if the perosn doesnt know how to multitask. Two if can effect you for example with your learning. Three its going to be hard for you to listen and to keep up with who you would be talking to. lets just say you apply for job and your stuck on phone texting others about other job opportunity and your interveiwer send out your job interveiw date and because you were stuck on your phone you miss your job interview. that would suck. for those reasons technology would effect. Technology itself is good and bad because theres many good things that you can do, but theres other things that you could miss. yes they both work good making or not making interactions with or without technology, but i rather have more human contact just because i rather not miss anything.

Sometime you will feel like youre not getiing answer or at least a signal. My second reason is that failure is going to come at some point in your life for example; teenager come at school, adult come at work, money wise, housing. failure is something that we all should learn how to over come that problem we should think for a solution make a plan in our life. how are we goinf to fix this part and find a solution to over come that problem if we need help from somebody. My third reason is that as soon as you over come failure you start learning thing about themselve, that they didnt know before, most people find ways to stop going back failing, thats when you start gaining the believe on keep going on practicing every single method to do not fail again.

The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier. My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home. This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion: Do not have to spend gas going to school. Do not spend in different clothes everyday. The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower. We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work. The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher. This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that dont let you go to school.

488,3616,597618D3F66C,"Can more hours in school help conserve energy?. The way we can save energy is by going to school for 4 days , and being in school for 2 extra hours. I think its a bad idea for the school to adopted the idea. This idea can make it harder for students that have things after school. The disadvantages of adding two extra hours to school can cause a lot of problems for the student ,and the teachers. Especially for students that have jobs and, have activity after school like sports and clubs. Also the student will be tired after school and they will have less time hang out with friends after school .The teachers can also have problems because they can possibly live in a different county and they might need to leave earlier to pick up their kids from school. Either way i think its a bad idea because it could ruin everyone daily routines. The advantage to be in school longer is that you would be able to finish work on time. Have more time on test and quiz. Will be able to learn more things in class and get more time in a class. Therefor, teacher would rarely give out homework. Students would be able to take more class ,and even be able to graduate faster because we are in school longer. Also we will have four days a week in school ,so thats means we have three day off so we can get some rest. We might be able to get out of school faster became the amount of time we are in school. Well I still think its still a bad idea for school to start later because a lot of problems for students , and the teachers. I think the students wont like the idea because some students have work after school ,or they have to pick up their siblings from school. Or even have sports after school. Some teachers possibly live thirty-minutes away and they might need to get their kids ,and they might need to go to the store and get food for dinner. So thats why I think its a bad idea to adopt the idea that the business is having because its different between students and grown ups.

489,3617,E9705A9C0FE5,"In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. Some students dont know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life. Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they dont know. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. In other cases that i havent really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future. I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City.

We all have the right to do whatever we want and be whoever we are unless you want to hurt someone. We are free to do what is better for ourselves without being judge, so why do we let society control us?. People should not be afraid to be who they are and show the world what they are made of. All humans are different, we all come with different shapes, sizes, personalities, skills and that is what makes us beautiful, the power of being ourselves. Experiences make you grow and morph you into a better person, life makes you realize how bold and smart humans are, in addition to this we all have been raised differently so trying to follow an exteriotype is like letting go the opportunity you have been given by life to find out what you are made of, to find oud your power, your way of doing things and solving problems, and last but not least you are letting go the opportunity to make up your own thoughts just because you are giving people the chance to control your mind and the way you think. I totally agree with this statement, to be yourself in an environment that is constantly trying to make you something else is one of the best decisions you could make, perhaps just by being yourself you could teach someone else how to improve its personality, or maybe you could show them how to act when it comes to solve an issue, theres is multiple opportunities we miss just by trying to be someone else . All humans have a superpower within their selves that they could share with everyone, therefore, trying to fit in, follow an exteriotype and trying to act the same way the others do is equal to not take advantage of our power wisely. We are afraid of showing who we are because, to us is more important what they would say and think about it. We care more about their reaction towards us and what we do not realize is that maybe they would like more who we actually are than the person that we are trying to be.

Or even as a kid when you mastered a video game you want to keep going keep getting challeged on each part of the game and when you finished on you buy another one and it keeps going even when you die on the video game you still try to keep going on unless you get fusterated and mad and you just give up and quit. Unless you keep trying you master the video game. The things that i had mastered was the most importent one was driving its was hared for me just to get my permit and i guess it grow on me beacuase i want to do more in life i want to be able to help my family and do what i can for my sisters and brother and my mom. Like out of all the thing i had mastered i say that is one of the thing i want to do becuase be able to go to callege be some thing in life. so i say the more you master the more you grow and know as a person. the reason why i think that the more you master the more you grow its becuase out of all the things that i had gone throw i realised that as im getteing older more and more chaleges that i will have to master will come my way in the future thing that i will want to master. i say this is why they make kids go to school so they can learn more things so that we can be challged and master things as we go throw school so we can see the type of person that we want to be in life so that we can face challeges thats whay i say the more things we master the more we grow so that we can learn from those thing.,5,5,5,5,4,5,43,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break. because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. I think idea is great. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer. Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. The educators should know this and think about. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students. In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family. This is how the school should be because it is hard to be here everyday, and it is so boring sometimes. This is what I think that how the school should be, but every head is a different world, and that make think the people in different ways to do things.",5,6,7,5,4,6,3102,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
494,3622,327EB11122D0,"Hello mi name is Generic_Name and my prompt is about Failure and Success. What i think about this? The failure is a feeling so bad, when you have a bad day or something was wrong,your feel the person most useless. Yes, I agree with Churchill statement, because he have all the reason. Each person failure has a recompense and all the good what you do make and God give to you multiply. We all have success why?,because everybody work so hard and they wish make all your dreams. In the personal, i think all start since down, when you everyday work hard your successful is each day more big and blessed,I have three reasons why i agree with this prompt. My first reason: Never say I cant because when you have a purpose you have to make,maybe many persons tell you forget it,you never cant this possible but you have to know when something is realize with the heart all is possible in this life never forget it. My second reason: Always you listen when somebody tell you something,because his advice can help you in the future and you can use the same advice for help other persons too. You need to be better every day for make a present and future so much better and be able to get what you wish. My third reason: If you not believe in who are you, you are in a big problem, the unique person can say what you can do or you cant not are you nobody else. In your life you have friends,teachers and you family is the most important in the world the people believe in you. Follow you dreams,follow you future, and always smile and when something was wrong, not feel bad,of course when you have a error you can learn and be a best person each day. What is my point of view on this? The life is so hard and beautiful,you can be wherever you want,follow you way and never stop,make the difference and never stop of dream. Be a nice person and do not even threat bad other people. Therefore, you never hands down when you see the past and now the present you can see what long you are, stay strong,be intelligent not lying and always say the true. When passed the time you can see all effort you dedicated,all is possible. Detail Support: My detail support is about the immigrant, this is a good example for this prompt,they came to United State for a better life,is very difficult and danger,because sometimes many persons died or have problems in the way, how much time is? honestly i dont know sometimes is one week,two weeks or more than of one month. When they finally here in United State is a new beginning is a new life,of course is so complicated and so sad,because is a new country and new culture y the most important the language is different. The principal thing is learn talk, and writing in English. After this if you have your permission of work,you can star working in a restaurant o something you can learn fast and easy or if you are minor of age you need go to middle school or high school dependent what age do you have for after you can graduated. and attain a best work. This is so hard but not impossible,maybe you have many days bad,and you cry so much,but each sacrificed has its pay back.

495,3623,40C0290A53F1,"American jazz legend Duke Ellington said ""A problem is achance for you to do you best."" The meaning of this is when you have a. Problem you have a chance to fix it before anything get even worse. I disagree with Duke Ellington because sometimes you cant always. Fix your problems, you might not be able to resolve the problem you have and. If you try to do your best with the problem and it doent work out you are going to make the problem even worse than it was before. Theres a problem with your sink and you dont know how to fix. It so what do you do you call a plumer to fix your sink pipes the plumer goes away to do another job and .Your sink starts to spit out water again you try to fix it because you where watching the plumer. Do it the first you try to fix it and the water leak gets worse and starts to flood your house so now you. Have to call the plumer again and pay again also you could havea called him before it started leaking again he could have walked you threw it. Some kids have pets and when those pets pass away and there. Parents try to replace the pet with another pet it will be hard for the kid he might not eat,sleep or even talk for along time. when my dog lucky died it was hard for me and my brother we barly ate or talked my dad. Tried to get other dog be me and my brother both knew it wasnt going to be the same. When your in school and you a kid sad and you ask him ""whats worng."" And he doent say anything back and you start talking about coming over after school because. You have to do project with this student and you say"" ask your dad if I can come over"" then the kid starts to cry because his dad passed. Away in a car accident last night then he tells you his dad died last night you made him worse than he was 20 minutes ago just from saying one simple thing. So american jazz legend Duke Elllington i disagree with that becasue you can make a lot of thing way worse than it ways from doing one think like trying to fix the sink, trying to replace a passed away pet and trying to make someone feel happy when you tried to make them feel happy.",5,4,6,4,5,5,844,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

My other reason we should is that it good to now about that career you want to do in the future. For an example like JROTC is an amzing thing it shows about how militray life is going to be if go throw that path. A other example is AOL it shows a care you want to learn about like becoming a firefighter and more like that. A other great expame is a career for a day.

497,3625,5D4D6519DF94,"Haile G/Selasie, one of the most famous long distance runners of all time, did not pave his way to success because he was born with it. He came from a poor family, and walked a long distance to his school everyday. When he started running, he was not good at all. He worked day and night to get to where he is. And when he speaks about his past, he tells the story of how he failed again and again a lot of times but he never lost his passion for his dream. And now he is one of the richest people in Ethiopia and one of the best record holders of Marathon. Success is a dream for most and a reality for only a few. When it comes to how success is achieved, it creates a great question in all our minds and that is,""How can I be successful?"". Some say that success is achieved by going through failures without giving up or without losing hope. That is a truly arguable idea and some might think different. But I fully agree with that idea. The fact that almost all of the masterminds that are known for their creations of the bulb, physics theories, telephone and many more of the things we take for granted at the moment told the story of how they tried and failed many times than they count. And that is one proof of the point that success doesnt come without failure. There might be some people that argue this point by pointing out that many people have tried and failed and tried again but it didnt help them achieve their dreams. That is a good point but the fact is that failing is not the only thing that determines your success, but failing and not being discouraged is what really counts. If we plan to achieve a goal, we shouldnt lose our excitement for that specific thing were doing, we should rather be more encouraged to try harder and to find another way to make it work. For example, when we first built a rocket,it wasnt done in a day or in the first try. Engineers tried to fix the problem in the mechanical part. Scientists tried to see if their calculations was wrong or if the combination of the chemicals didnt work and many others tried to fix it but they failed more than a couple of times. By not giving up though, it was a success at last. It might not always seem like it but failure leads to success. The main point is not giving up and not losing our enthusiasm. As the saying goes, ""If you fail once, try and try harder"". Never give up on your dreams and dont be discouraged by failure.

498,3626,77FAA33476CA,"Why does most people want multiple advice when they are seeking for advice? As human beings we all go through hard times in life because that is how life works. When we go through those hard times we want to ask for help from maybe a friend, family, or just anyone that is close to you and you know them very well. Seeking for advice does not only mean you are having trouble with something. Asking for advice can also mean asking someone if you are making the right choice. Something that we have to remember is that not evryone is not ok with asking people for their advice. There are many reasons why most people are afraid of asking their friends or family for advice is because they are scared they might judge them or laugh at them. Something else most people are afraid is their family or friends might think they are crazy or they are just making things up. For my final reason I think this reason is the really importent in my opinion because this is what a lot of time kids, teens, go through is people might think they are doing this for attention. Now by attention I dont mean something as so they could get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know whats right for your own kid and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what. What I am writing about is something that I have been through in life. There were a lot of times in my life where a lot of my friends were going through really hard times in life and most of the pain they were going through was their families not caring or thinking that their kid is crazy and they just want attention. The truth is if you wanna help your friends or even family members you need to give them the right opinions that you have and help them find other people who can help them and give them their opinions. Something else that is really helpful when seeking multiple opinions is, it helps the person make a better choice. Again this might not be so easy for the person, but it opens more doors for them and it makes them feel like they do have a way out of their problems. In 6th grade I had a really great friend she came from a different countrie and she was from Generic_City, and had no idea how to speak english. She did knew some words like how to say hi or say her name, but that was all she could speak. After a couple of mounths in school I noticed that she was having a very hard time in school because many people bullied her. Everyday when she came to class she was always sad or she was always in the office. I knew that my friend was going through something so I tried talking to her and helped her by giving my opinions of what she can do and what she should do in order to slove her problems. By giving her many opinions she was able to overcome her problems and she was always happy and she was starting to speak a little more english and it was like as if she was a whole new person. This might not be easy for many people who has a close friend that is going through something and they dont want to talk about it because most of the time they are shy or they dont want people to know. Always keep in mind that just because that person does not want to tell you anything does not mean they are ok or they dont need help, always try to talk to them and tell them that you care and you want to help them. This can also build up the persons confidence and it helps them to open up more with their feelings and they can try to talk to their family members or their friends more often. Now why is Seeking Multiple opinions really importent? Well I just told you there are many reasons why its importent. It helps people to know they matter and there is a sloution to their problems no matter what they are going through. It opens more doors for them, and helps them know that they do matter and they should talk to people they can trust. Something that parents need to keep in mind is that when your kid asks for advice dont think they are crazy or they just want attention because that is not the point, they just want help with what they are going through. Again by attention I dont mean something as so they can get the parents attention I mean they might be asking for your advice because you are the parent and you know whats right for your own kids and you want to always make sure you support them no matter what.

501,3629,FEAF4F517583,"To begin with, there are different opinions about to do something beyond of what we have already mastered and for that reason we will never grow. Some people idea is that if they have already their master they will stop there, but thats not the point. I believe that we have to keep trying and learning until the end ; for example, if you never try something different you will never grow. Im agree with author Ralph Emerson and here are my reasons why: One reason, is you will have more experience. Experience make people rich and I am not talking about profit. For example, if I go to apply for a job and I just have a high school diploma because all I wanted was a high school diploma, but there is another applicant that have more than a high school diploma he also have a diploma as a plumber. This applicant have more experience and more masters, he prepared himself more than me , so he will get the job. Sometimes in life we have to be ambitious in a property way. I am agree with author Ralph because learning differently means growing. The reason is I will be more mature, for example ; I will gain more mature because I have learned based of my mistakes, moreover will be easier for me than another person that just stayed with the easiest. There are many people that give up at the first try; although, life is not easy but at least dont give up at: the first, second and the third try. Another reason why trying something new of what I already have is I can reach more goals; in other words, at this time in society your value depends a lot on what you have, you can more privileges if you have more goals earned. For example, my goal is to be a police officer but after I reach my goal I will keep looking for a highest range, and that will make me grow: economically, physical and mentally. In addition, while you are mastering new goals you will be growing at the same time. In conclusion many people is not agree to this idea because many of them like the easier, but the easier is not valuable .There will be many obstacles, and people will think that is the end; consequently, they will not grow sufficiently to know that the most they try the most opportunities of gain they have. However, in my opinion is never late to continue learning because; The more we learn that more we know, and the more we know the more we grow.",7,6,6,6,6,7,3880,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

503,3631,AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that theyre more successful than you. Thats exactly why you shouldnt trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but dont put your 100% trust in them because its always that one person that you wouldnt expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldnt let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, dont to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that thats you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself. You shouldnt be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone theyre, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person theyre with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they cant accept who you are? Shouldnt you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how theyre acting towards you. Thats why I dont let people influence me in any way because you never know what that persons intentions. be your own person and dont ever be someone yourre not, and you should never change for someone just cause they dont like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see whos really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend dont respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go. My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and dont let somebody take control in your life or dont get influenced by people that dont have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Dont try to be perfect for somebody elses, if you wanna do that then do it dont do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it. But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you cant trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Dont try to act or be somebody that youre not, show who you really are and your true color because thats how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest. It takes time for other people to open their eyes but when they do they will realize a lot of stuff going on.

504,3632,DE20CFA52C1D,"What are the benefits of working with a group and working alone? I believe that working in groups helps you to have more ideas, more knowledge, because if you communicate with your group members, theyll think about different ideas to proceed the work that is getting done. Working alone sometimes helps you more than working with groups because you are responsible for your own work. I rather work by myself because Ive had bad experience working with groups. When I work in groups sometimes Im the one that has to do all the work, and in my opinion if we are working in groups we have to help each other, communicate and share our thoughts because if we dont do that whats the point of working in groups. However, I think working in groups is important because you can come out of your comfort zone and be free to share your thoughts with your group members, and you can make friends too. For example, Im a very shy person, its rare the times I talk in class but when Im in a group I have to talk, share my thoughts with my group members and communicate with them. Reasons why I prefer working alone are: I focus more doing my own work, its only my responsibility not others, I have to worry to turn it in on time, if i get a bad grade its going to be my fault not others, Im responsible for my own actions, I have to make sure if everything is right to get all the credit. Reasons why I dont like to work in groups are: sometimes theyre not responsible for doing their part, if they do their work they do it all messy( you cant even understand their hand writing), they play around too much because sometimes they take it as free time, they spend most of the time on their phone instead of doing what they are supposed to do, sometimes they dont do their part in time and we have to turn it in late and dont get all the credit. I believe working in groups is beneficial but at the same time its not, I think it depends with the people you work with, because if you work with people that do their work and actually care about school they will definitely be beneficial and make your group work out. If you work with someone who doesnt care and is always playing around, you wont get anything done and will receive a bad grade unless you do all the work and the other person will just get credit by not doing anything, in that case there is no point to work in groups. In conclusion, I believe its more beneficial to work alone than groups because you can focus more on what youre doing and take responsibility of your own work, because if you dont take care of your school work nobody is going to do it for you. So you have to chose whats better for you and whats going to benefit you more, but for me I feel like working alone is more beneficial for me than working in groups.

Phones need to be turned off while in class or in the library if not they might get there phone taken away and they need to pick it up at the end of the day. Students phones must be in their backpacks or in their pockets during class. On, this policy by having phones at school the students should just leave their phones at home so it wont be taken by the teacher or so you wont loose it at school or other students wont have to rob you. So thats why students should really leave there phones at home. Another thing why students should not bring their phones to school at all it might fall and brake when you walk or if your texting you might bump into each other I believe that students really need to leave there phones at home because someone might call in the middle of class. or a friend might text you in the middle of class also so students leave your cell phones at home..",7,7,7,6,8,8,3793,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
510,3638,7AAE019F70D6,"I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because kids have other things to do like homework,they might be already doing a activity and theyll get tired faster if the principal make them do a other activity, and it can contain stress if you dont get it right the first time. For and foremost, I disagree with the principal saying that all kids should at least join one extracurricum activity because the student have homework to do and I know that i get a lot of homework maybe you do too i also know teachers give kids projects and if the principal makes them do a extra activity then they wont be able to have anytime to do their own things. Also studies have shown that making kids do a extra activity can contain a lot of stress and who wants to be stressing I know I dont, and it can also contain kids losing sleep do to the activities if they have homework and a activity to do itll make the students lose sleep due to the activity and the brain needs a good hours of sleep for it to function well. This is why I say principals shoudnt make students join activies Secondly, I disagree with the principal because the students will get way more tired faster and did you know that someone in Washington DC, fainted due to the principal making the student do a other activity and thats why the principals shouldnt make students join a other activity because itll most likely make them get tired faster and what we want is to keep our kids healthy but we cant keep them healthy if the principal makes them join a activity. Lastly,my last reason is stress, stress can come from a lot of things like work,school,friends,parents,children as you see stress comes from a lot and school stress is a big oe because we all know sometimes our grades go down and when we try to bring them up it gets really stressful and espcially if your pricipal is making you do a other activity thatll make even more stress and multiple studies have shown that a lot of the stress that kids get is from school and other activies. Those were all of my reason on why the principal shouldnt make students join a other activity espcially if they dont want too. Overall,I disagree with the principal making students do a other actvity because of homework,losing sleep faster and last but not least is stress.

More time equlas a lot of work getting compled. in conclusion we need a homework club it can help out a lot of students and save a lot of pernts money, and also make stundents pass more tests and help tham on schoolwork, and make students feel like difficult work is easy since they got all the help they need from the afterschool club, also if some teachers dont feel like staying for another they could just let the students help each other and let the teacher rest. overall I think this idea is very good, and well help out a lot of students with there work.

515,3643,4B6DF39107CC,"Is it a good idea to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year? Based on my experiance in high school, i disagree with students who graduate high school in three years, besause students can take college credits while they have short schedual on their senior year, and also they can get into the clubs that would give them the idea of that they would do after the graduations. In order to graduate high school in three years students must take summer school, give up on their elective courses, and give up on their vacations. Students have to take three years of summer school in order to graduate high school early. They are required to complete all the credits that is neccessary for graduations. They must complete the requirements for graduation before it is too late. If the students chooes to skip one year of summer school credit they cannot graduate in three years, and they will have rough time trying to cought up. If they still got lazy than there is no other way to graduate then four years plan. This is where their whole stuggles end up, and they still have to be in school for the fourth year. Students have to give up on their electives during their high school year to graduate. They will have full schedual of requirements to finish up. They have to work hard, do all the work for all of their classes, turn in almost every homework for their classes. They will be struggling during school year since they do not have an elective class that they will be not hard to think about, also some schools offers courses that would give students the ideas for their college life, such as Generic_School. It is an engineering courses that give the students idea of what they would do if they want to be an engineer. Students will give up on their summer vocations because they will be taking summer school to graduate high school in three years instead of additional four year. However students will be doing their school stuff while others will be celebrating their vocations. Students who want to finish up their schools early, they will be attending summer schools. Becide it they also be working, and maybe they wonld not have time to complete their assignments on time, it will make them to change their opinnoin on early graduation, they will give up on their early graduation plan. To conclude, it is not the best choice to graduate high school in three years, additionally students would have rough and tamble time trying to finish high school. Therefore, it will be better if they stick with a normal school time and finish high school in four years, it will help them to get more knowledge, and better undrestainding of that they would do for their oncoming life. For the majority of people its better to graduate high school in four years, even though if they are aiming for advance deploma they will need to take full four years of high school, and summer school as well, but if the students are going for standard deploma they will have short schedual, and they can take advantage if it and take college credits for free on their senior year.

Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma ",7,6,6,8,6,6,2064,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

There are multiple ways to have fun at parks for example, you can play soccer, explore the park, and play football with your friends and family. First of all, when youre at a park you most likely want to have a good time with your family and friends. Soccer is a good way to relax. You may ask "" Why is soccer a good activity to relax?"" well, when youre playing soccer you can get your mind off things. It helps you think more on the game then what else is going on out side of the field. Also soccer is a good way to communicate with one another. Second of all, you can play a game of football. Football is also a good way to communicate with one another. For example, in football if we want to win we have to have a good game plan. So, we have to gather our opinion and thoughts to make the right plan. Football is a good way to bring everyone together to communicate. Third of all, you dont always have to play a sport to have fun. You can go explore around the park. For example, you can go walk around, look at the beautiful trees and flowers, and go hiking. While you are also there you can take beautiful pictures! To sum up, there are multiple activities you can do at the park. Think about other activities that you can do with your family and friends.

525,3653,AC3111702C95,"First impressions are always important and can really effect how you are looked at but they are not impossible to change. They impact whether you get the job, make that friend or even if you get service if you are somewhere. I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change, they are hard but not impossible. Firstly, because someone could always forget, people can change, and you could receive a second chance to redeem yourself. I have met people a second time that either I had a bad first impression with or they did and we forgot all about it. When you forget about somebody, the first impression with obviously not matter. You will forgive and forget. Also when I say the word ""forget,"" I do not mean completely lose all knowledge of the other person, but I mean maybe you did not care or maybe the first impression was not terrible that it was easy to block from your memory. I have changed and many people in my life have also changed. Your first impression or somebody elses first impression might change if you meet them again in five to ten years. Over a period of time if lets say somebody who had a bad job interview wants to change and really wants the job, they will change and they will ask for another opportunity. Even if you have a bad encounter with someone the five times you have met them, your opinion about them will change with just one good impression. People change and when they do, so do impressions. Second chances are also very important with impressions. Redeeming themselves is something a lot of people tend to do. Chances are not hard to ask for, and when making it up to somebody for a bad impression, you need to make it count. I have asked several people for second chances to redeem myself for bad impressions and now, we are friends. When I first applied to my first job, I was late to my interview and that is why I did not get the job. Then I asked my boss for a second chance, he gave it to me and now I have an amazing job. In conclusion, no, first impressions are not impossible to change because there is forgetful people, people change and second chances exist. It is not hard to be on your best behavior or to be well dressed when meeting someone new, especially if they are of higher authority. First impressions are not impossible but are difficult to change, that is why it is good to try and make a good first impression to save you from trouble.",8,9,8,8,8,9,2311,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
526,3654,5D5672D7C97D,"The famous scientist Albert Einstein said, ""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" This is especially true for todays world. Even with seven billion people on Earth, everyone is unique. Your imagination is vast; an open plain of wondrous ideas and possibilities. This leads to even more diversity than our physical differences. It is also applied to our day, and it makes it more lively. And while knowledge is powerful, imagination can make it far stronger. Imagination is more important than knowledge because of creativity and experimentation. First, imagination leads to creativity. Your can put your ideas to life through creativity, and theres plenty of ways to do so. You can construct a masterpiece of your choosing, whether it be art, music, or even writing! Even thousands of years ago, creativity makes its mark. Rough drawings by cavemen depict tales of hunts and adventures. Beautiful artifacts and pottery dot museums. Ancient literature such as Beowulf and The Odyssey still fascinate modern writers. And recently, artists and musicians such as Bob Ross and Duke Ellington have made amazing pieces through their creativity, just like the legendary Leonardo da Vinci and Beethoven. Time wears things down, but not imagination. This is immensely important as creativity allows you to express yourself. You can voice out your thoughts and ideas in so many forms. With imagination being limitless, so is your creativity, and so are your possibilities. Next, imagination leads to more experimentation. Going mad-scientist isnt recommended, but you can poke around with new ideas and find a new talent or hobby. More experimenting can lead you to find something you really enjoy! Trial and error can be disheartening, but dont give up! You could find something that could change your future. It can be fun too; testing different paths to a single destination. Not only can you find the best road to a goal, but you can spread the knowledge to others. The results from tinkering around varies from little things to giant discoveries. Take Damascus steel for example. The forging process for the metal has been lost, which has consistently frustrated modern metallurgists. A steel from times long gone, but still baffling todays scientists. Thats a pretty amazing feat! Experimenting from your imagination is wild, but its enjoyable and even rewarding! However, some say knowledge helps daily life more than imagination. Valuable things, such as language, mathematics, history, and science. Knowledge does help with life, but most of the things you learn are often useless or forgotten along the way. Math and Language Arts are important, but unless youre pursuing teaching or poetry, some aspects arent very useful. For example, being acknowledged that plants are green because of chlorophyll isnt going to help with paying taxes. Imagination can make life better and enjoyable. Decorating your house or doodling a picture can be more relaxing and fun than first thought. In addition, most of the knowledge obtained cant be applied without a good imagination. And while some people may have an upper edge in academics, everyone is on equal ground in imagination. In conclusion, being able to experiment and create with limitless possibilities makes imagination more important than knowledge. Making ideas come to life is fun and shows what youre capable of. Creativity holds the ever-important ability to express yourself. Experimentation is enjoyable and can be rewarding. You never know what you can do unless you try, and testing your skills is a great evaluation. And all of this traces back to one thing everyone has: an imagination.",9,10,10,9,9,10,1204,"conventions 10, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 9"

I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places. To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when Im mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I dont learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class. Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I dont understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph. In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn.

530,3658,E4643D2ADD0A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I agree, because it gives them more experience to use their brains more, it makes people develop more, and it helps you from being dependent all the time. Using your instincts gives people more experience to use their brains more. Some people dont use their common sense to solve problems, because theyre afraid that theyre going to make it worse. Its okay to make mistakes. For example, If youre going on a trip with your family, and you find out that theres going to be a traffic in the morning, what will you do? Wake up early in the morning before the traffic forms. Thats how you use your brain. You think and plan ahead before things go bad. People developing more is great for your brain, because it makes you smarter and brighter. More ideas can be useful if you put your mind into it. For example, if you want your boss to be impressed by you, you need to act and use your instincts to create new ideas. It can help you be successful and more reliable. Instincts help you from being dependent all the time, because you wont be able to be with your friends forever. You have to use your common sense to help you along the way to your adulthood.

532,3660,248407B5DBB2,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" For example to run without connected to the power is not useful work. I agree with Thomas Jefferson that from doing nothing we can not gain anything. Because if we are always doing something ,we can learn from what we are doing, and we can reach the goal that we have . If we are always doing something we will get a good result and we can learn many things. For example when I was in high school I was just doing my school works and I did not have any job or something else to do after school in my free time, so I thought maybe I can join the school soccer team because soccer was one of my favorite sport and I was always watching soccer games and I was thinking maybe I will be also a good soccer player in future too. And then I tryout for school soccer team and I did not have any experience about playing soccer and I was thinking negative, because I though maybe I will not be able to join the team because of my talent and I did not know anything about soccer, and there were many kids for tryout with good talent and skills that they had. When it was the time for tryout I went for it and the coaches were testing, but when I got the result I did not make it, I was so sad that day and I was never going to give up because of the dream that I had. After that, two months later I join a soccer club for training and I was trying my best to learn soccer an many other skills. And after a year when it was about to start the next season of tryouts, I made it to the team and I was so happy and proud to be in the team to accomplish many things for my self and my school. It is always a wonderful thing if we are doing something or working toward the goal that we have. For example when I graduated from high school my goal was to go to college and I wanted to be an IT Engineer. And that was not an easy thing for me,because of the expense of the college and the subject that I was thinking to study. And I did not have the budget for it,so I was wondering if I could work and make the make money that I needed for college. And the cost for the subject that I was thinking about to study in college, it was going to cost me around twenty thousands dollar for the whole semester. And my parents were also supporting me a little bit,but I needed to make the rest of the amount by working. Finally I got a job near by our house and I did not have a driving license, so I was walking to my job. And the first days of working it was a little bit challenging for me, I did not know anything about the job and it was also a new experience for me .And I had to work and accept the difficulties and challenges that were upcoming for me to reach my goal. After two months later I was thinking to get also another job beside the job that I was already working on, so I could make more money to accomplish my goal early. And also I found another job and I was working in both of them and I had a shift of four hour in each. And I learn many things from doing my job and after a year and half I had the amount of the money that I needed for college and finally I reach my goal.

535,3663,298969937643,"I am against this issue because, its just not a good idea for students to graduate high school early, and enter the work force and college one year early. My reasons for this would be that, those who do graduate early will miss out on school activities. They will have to do so much preparation. Some dont see that after high school life gets tough, and who knows if theyll be able to handle it. Early graduates will graduate a year early, but, they dont realize that they will miss out on school activities. Some activities that excite students would be, the school dances such as prom, and homecoming. Dances are meant to enjoy a night with friends, and get all dressed up for the night. Also the day before a dance, there is always a football game, which is exciting because everyone goes to support the team and if they win they celebrate the day after, which would be at the dance. Pep- rallies are when all four grade levels come together and verse each other on which class has the loudest cheer, and who has the most points when it comes to the games they end up playing. Spirit week is also when all classes verse to win points. To earn the points they must dress up as the theme of that day or buy what is being sold that day. The themes they would usually do would be twin day Monday, polka dot Tuesday, and for the sells it would be spirit chains that get hung up. Senior activities are when all the graduates do their last activities with those classmates theyve been knowing since elementary school. They have a senior picnic which is when only the seniors go and have lunch together. Also some go on a class trip and they take their class picture. Even though early graduates will miss out on school activities theres more important things than that. They might think that they are ready, but in reality they dont think about the preparation they need to face. Depending on what diploma they are headed for either the standard or advance, each diploma has its requirements for graduation. Standard diplomas really dont ask for much. There might be a chance that you wont be in need of doubling up on classes. Unlike the advance diploma it asks for so much. An advance diploma may require you to double up due to the fact that it requires many classes. Also students wont be able to take any of those exciting elective courses that are by most the best classes a student could take. Of course the classes arent the only thing that must be completed, there are many tests that take place. Math, science, history, and the most difficult would be the English test. They must pass each test for graduation. This would mean that, students wont have time to distract themselves by other things, and, will have to stay on task to maintain their grades up. Some might say otherwise that if theyre going through this road its because they are aware and are ready. Although graduating early excites them, it is better if they wait another year and graduate when they have to. My reason to this would be because the work force and college will be completely different than high school. High school might be the easiest part of starting to understand life. Most students that graduate early are juniors, and are sixteen and seventeen years of age. This is pretty difficult at that age, they would have a hard time finding a decent job that will help them pay their tuition; unless they have another way of paying like a scholarship or some other way. Perhaps some might do both work and school at the same time, but, it could end up being too hard on them because they are too young and arent as prepared as they thought. If some were to be at the age of eighteen they would have to face adult responsibilities; such as taxes, rent, insurance, and much more. However some might think otherwise. People who favor this issue support early graduation. Their reasoning would be that its an early start in life, and some students do it certain reason. It could be a family matter or other reasons. But, I disagree, in no way is graduating high school early good. Those students that graduate early will miss out on so many good things that come with high school. They will be stressed due to so much they had to do just to get out a year early; if that didnt stress them out then having to go college and going to work to pay for their education will.

But,not only you but the others in the surrounding Therefore, being nice and kind to others helps the way people look and act when they show their first impressions to others. First of all, first impressions not only are by judged by the person of a face but ,can sometimes leave a good mark or bad one because the way people look and the attitude they give. Sometimes thats why when people are going to give a first impression it has to be a clear and nice way so that the other gives back to people. Otherwise, when meeting with them later in the future they will regret to have spoken and talken to you because lack of behavior. So maybe think clearly andi treat others the way they do to others. Next time think of what positive things to share around and impressions to others. Secondly, sometimes its impossible to change impressions and thats why we think before we speak. One way by noticing is when meeting a new person and by their first impression. Its says a lot by just looking at their behavior and attitude not only because the way they speak but interact with others. For example. when meeting a new employee at my job employees have to introduce themselves to each others so that they can create a long-lasting relationship. But, when meeting a new employee there was a guy and I introduced myself to him and he had just passed by without saying anything and was shocked when that happened.. Because, when meeting new people you have to introduce yourself to others like any other person in the world. Not only because their new but it helps people interact with each other. Lastly, being able to give the first impression to others means a lot because it represents who you really are and the person you want to be. Therefore, people will comprehend the way you feel about others and how you treat them. So that your family and friends can be proud of who you are and realize who youve become as a person. Then, treat other with respect and kindness so that many others can spread positive things in life. maybe so later in life you can become someone and treat others the way you treat yourself. Then realize that first impressions always count as a good way to introduce yourself to others. To summarize, the person who you are today is the person that can be later in life. Thats why first impressions always count no matter what and where you are and how you act as a person. Not only that but it also say a lot about people and you. Being kind and generous to others can affect the world by a lot not only by being kind but can help the people around you. Just by having a good impression of yourself people can take it to other good ways in life. So thats why we as persons have to be the that lead the next generation and with a good personality.",7,9,8,7,8,8,2263,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 7"
537,3665,37DD80EFE4D4,"Would you like your child go to the college or work force early ? Why not ? Some schools offers ways to a student to be prepared and go into their goals . However, most of the students think that they are ready to reach their goals early instead of going 4 years high school because it makes more complex for a student who wants to finish high school and be prepared for the future. I consider saying , there are ways for them to get ready because students get jobs , start college early and get experience or success that can makes them a professional as quickly as they can . For instance, start college early, the student could learn more about their careers and get some ideas for what they look for . Other reason is the students get jobs easily, makes them work for the future for not being the guy who works in restaurants and other stuffs with a low income . Lastly , Be success in your life, thats why parents are so prouds of their childrens and taking care for a good path Finally , I conclude saying that going 3 years high school is going be easiest to a student because the could learn more , get more experience and be successfull in their daily life , as much as they can , student provide more percentage of intelligence that can be more well known at a short period ",6,6,6,5,5,7,724,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

540,3668,72A69C1B34A8,"I think students should have the opportunity to choose their own classes as electives rather than taking a class in the arts because if they were assigned to a class they know nothing about then that would be setting them up for failure and I do strongly believe that is not the right way to go about things especially in the school district. We cannot let the students fail because it is important to have something to look forward to when they arrive to school. It is a definite requirement for students to take classes such as music, drama, and art however, it would be fair to let them decide on their own behalf. Once a students picks the class they would hopeful and full of joy to attend to it everyday. I believe that no matter what a student can decide what they believe in and have no dought about it. The students should have the ability to be successful in school if they put their minds into it. Although if the counclours put students in the classes they dislike in my opinion, the student will most likely not attend to the classes they were assigned to. Furthermore It would be appropriate to encourage students to choose the right fit class they would want to enroll in. I challenge you to go through with this action to let the students decide on their own. in conclusion, given this opportunity for the students it will increase the satisfaction rate and expand on more ideas for the school in the future. The students will become positive and get good grades because they made a decision that could possibly impact their future goals.

542,3670,C3D8E8E8B942,"Some schools require students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break. Should these summer projects be teacher-desdigned or students-designed? These summer projects should be student-designed for varies reasons such as, engagment, vaction, and lastly, confidence. Students during the summer have many things to worry about like having a job, looking after siblings or even their mental health and the last thing on their mind is a techer-designed project. The projects given throughout the summer should be student-designed becuase it allows the student to be engaged. The student will be more engaged because it is a topic that they want to learn about and being engaged shows that the student is willing to learn and is very intrested in his or her own topic. Typically, when a teacher assigns a project to a student, the student isnt very pleased and with that being said, it could affect the amount of effort and the desire that the students puts into actually learning. Secondly, these projects also need to be student-designed because of summer experiences. During the summer, alot of students grow. Vaction plays a big role in the students growth and development, as the students travel they pick up more and more knowledge, which expands their knowldege and could possibly change thier perception of things, making it easier for them to have better ideas and to do well on their summer projects. Lastly, student-designed projects over break leads to confidence. Because the student has had the freedom of choosing what he or she wants to learn about, it just makes it easier for the students to showcase their work with pride. Pride meaning, showing that the student has learned and is more than comfortable to enlighten others. To have confidence about what you have put alot of time into and worked on is an important skill to develop because the student will surely use it some other time in their lifetime. In conclusion, these summer projects should be student-designed because it will surely keep the student engaged in his or her own learning and add a little more excitement to the students vacation because the project is something they are eager to learn and work on. Lastly student-designed projects will help build the students confidence because they know what they are talking about.

543,3671,6ACB38C6577C,"Should a students work be praised no matter how bad it is? This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them. A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that theyll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired. In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing. But i am saying that with every praise should be a criticism just to balance it out and show the students that with every positive comes a negative and that the worlds not just going to be all praise to a person.",7,6,7,6,7,5,1387,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Although some say that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment . Actually it shouldnt because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. Some say that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classrooms because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. For example one day my English teacher told me that she let her students to use their phone during a test to search something about the meaning of the words that they doesnt know. Then, she told me that she told them that they can only use their phones to translated the words that they doesnt know what it means or to translated to their own language. After that she says that she gave to her students the test and she went to seat to her desk, but then she was observing that one of her students was using his phone too frequently, she went to see what the student was searching and she saw that the student was searching for the answers of the questions that the test have. After that, she saw that one of the others students was taking pictures of the exam, she went to see why the student was taking pictures of the exam, she ask him that why he was taking pictures of the exam and he told her that he was sending the answers to his friend who was sitting in the back seat. Moreover, she told me that the other day that she was explaining the class, some students were using their phone and paying less attention to the class. Also, she says that the students who were using their phones during the class when they got the test they doesnt know what to answer because they were distracted with their phones and they got a lower score in the exam. I believe that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classroom because is a distraction for students, sometimes there are students that when the teacher is explaining the class they are using their phones and when the teacher gave them a test they got bad score in their test and that can be a problem because their grades can get very lower. Those who believe that cell phones should be allowed in classrooms have their reasons, they believe that using cell phones in the classroom it can help students to research for a project or it can help to do any other assignment. One example can be my friend Generic_Name, his history teacher always gave him assignments that he have to search in the book about the Civil War or World War II. He told me that its very complicated for him to search some things about those tittles in the book because the books doesnt have enough details for him to what to put in his assignment or sometimes he doesnt know how to summarize the meaning of the paragraphs that the book have. However, when the teacher let him use his phone he began to search about the tittles that he have to search and he says that its more easy for him to understand more about those tittles because he is using his phone for a educational purpose. Also, he says that when he plays Kahoot or Quizlet live ( those are learning games that sometimes the teachers use to help students to study ) he learn more than when he read a book. In my point of view I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because for me sometimes is very complicated to read a book because there are some words that I dont understand, but when I use my phone to search its more easy because in the phone there are some meanings that I understand . In summary, some say that cell phones shouldnt be allowed in classroom because students can cheat during a test and they get distracted. However, some believe that cell phone should be allowed in classrooms because it can help students to research for as project and to do any other assignment. In my opinion I believe that cell phones should be allowed in school because it easy for me to search the meaning of a word that I dont know and I feel that I learn more then treading a book.

I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life. One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better. Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistakes helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistakes will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful. Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life. These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.",6,6,6,6,6,6,1452,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

554,3682,F5EFA67354E6,"Yes, I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchills statement, because people do fail over and over again without loosing enthusiasm. I have good enthusiasm. For example I failed a lot of classes in high school and I had to repeat them I gave all of my best effort on every class I had to take even if I wasnt good at it or if I didnt like it because I dont want to keep repeating them just because I didnt try i have great confidence on every skill I have and i always try to improve them in a better way I ask for help to see what i need improve on and I eventually did get better and it was worth it because it made things much easier i understood all of the problems I had trouble with I brought my grades up on the class I was failing on i mostly got Bs on the tests and quizzes its way better than getting a D I was glad that I was making changes and improvement on my skills it was the best thing I have ever done. I have dont ever give up, for example one time i remember i had to do make a little video game for my school project and as i was making it i didnt know what kind of video game to make i didnt have any ideas of what to make and i thought of giving up because i didnt know what to make and then i started thinking of making a first person shooting game and it was mostly like the game Call of Duty but i made a little change to it i put in the choices to choose any gun from the previous games it can be a gun from any Call of Duty game i feel like that was a good idea because some people would really like to have some of the old weapons back and they like a game that is boots on the ground and i also made a zombie game mode i put in some better things in that mode and i kept adding more details to the game and i am actually glad that i didnt give up because it tells me that I am not a quitter and that i wont be giving up so easily. some people would disagree with Winston Churchill statement because they dont believe that failure would consist to success they think that if you fail your gonna fail again over and over no matter how hard you try your always gonna fail i know some people say that because i had a friend that literally gave up so fast it was pretty sad and i kept telling him that you have to keep trying theres no other choice you can do but push yourself and he didnt he just gave up and didnt even bother to try. However not everyone gives up so fast because they believe in themselves they dont loose their confidence even when they are not at their best they still wont give up because they know they can do better the next time they do it you just got to keep trying till you make it.

Where can a companies be build at in urban places are rural places. When do people come to bring stuff to make something to sell it because they will need stuff to make the thing to sell it and get money to invest to the company so it will grow. What is the cost for all the meltarsils of the company to be able to run correctly so not a lot of money is put in to it and get broke and struggle with money that is needed. Going to a company can help others if they want to work in a company. Some people want to see how it feels to work or be a manager and time to put in to work.

Others would like to take classes that are based on future careers that are intreging to them.

Studnets most likely will lose focuse or wonder off in class if not intrested. Sometimes might even oviod the class. As a studnet myself i amdit that losing focuse in class when not being intrested came very easy to me. Not only does it cause the sttudent fustraction but it also causes the teacher fustration to see a student not pertesapating in class. School is a piec of pie for some students and having to take classes that are an easy A seems to be a wast of time for some studnets that would like to get high school over with and jump right into college. Some high school provide studnets free college credit classes that benifits fanatuly wise and skill wise. Having more then enough credits helps the student one graduate early and two have credits even before starting college.

I strongly agree with Thomas, because when Im feeling idle. I intend to get sad, or depressed, therefore never be idle. Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore heres some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job. Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, youll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle. My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now im not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us. My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasnt just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isnt easy. And its amazing to see the building now, to see how much its improved from last time i was there and now its just like a maze to me. This is why I believe its never okay to be board, or idle.

This required classes are also important when getting into a college. Having to take all the classes they need, can barely fit into their schedules. This would enable students to be enrolled in elective classes like art, drama, music, or photography. Some people may say that students finishing high school in three years, and enter college or the workforce one year early, its a good idea. However, it can be very stressful for students. Students have to study for all of their classes, do homework at home, and keep up with their classwork, so they wont get behind. Additionally, students have to do projects, and presentations. All of these can stress students a lot, and wont have time for their own. Its not a good idea for students to finish high school, and enter college or the workforce one year early. Students would need to take classes during the summer or in the evenings. Students would not be able to take elective classes. Also, finishing one year early can be stressful for students. Schools should not offer students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early.",9,9,8,8,9,8,1972,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

569,3697,E2F31005AF32,"Only topic that is frequenthy is debate today is whether or not conserve energy and resouces since some business have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? Some peolpe think that not only extending the school day should conserve energy and resource. They feel that is the same thing and also too that is more time in the school in addiction that they will spent more money in energy like electricity, ligths , charge to computers ,blackboard electric and the more things, an resource that should spent more is the water because some students when go to the bathroom they forget closed the washstand. I believe that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because should be take care about of how to conserve energy, resources and the last but not the least is we will have more time for make a the world better and take consience. One reason i believe why that should follow this model by extending the school day two hours is because we can conserve more energy for the future, and also too the school should instruct to each student to be careful about the how to consume energy, for example to teach wich focus is the correct for the use in the home and gives tips for that maybe they to pay the least possible bill of light. Another reason is that i feel that a resource that we can save in the school is the water because all students use almost two time the bathroom and always to take down the pull of the toile, i think the students can make posters in where show the importance about how to save the water and others resources that in the school can save is the plastic and paper because in some places purchase this resources, and with the money the school should to be a better school than others and the students should be more careful about this rescources. The final reason is that i believe if the school add two hours at the day students and teachers should will have more time for to do more thigs, a thing that the teachers and students will can do is maybe a propaganda, in this propaganda they can show the society how prevent the clime global and to instruct how to be careful with of world, other thing that the students can do is a page online in where to instruct the other students and people out school how make herself have to be careful. As you have read i think that the school should add two hours per day becuase all peolpe in the school can have more conscience for to save the energy and resource the last but not the leas the world.

570,3698,1202062A4FA5,"Just like some businesses schools should adopted a four day school week with each day consisting of ten hours by making the school day two hours longer. To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adapted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours. Should this school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? After considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week. Some believe that changing the school week to only four days is a bad idea because less school days means most work is not done and students will have extra time they dont need. Other people think a four day school week is an effective way of conserving students energy while keeping the same passe. People are still arguing about this issue. Schools should adopted a four day work week because students will be productive, It is healthy especially for students that work and have time for family and friends. Four days of school week help students to be productive. To be productive you need two things energy and motivation. Most students have the motivation to work but they lake the energy therefor they need four day school week. By extending the school day two hours we can achieve the same amount of work by working only four days. For example one school day is consists of for classes and one class is one hour and forty five minuet long. When we extend the school day two hours long for four days it covers the same time. That helps us to use own time efficiently and increase productivity in the school. Learning four days week also help students to be healthy specially for those who work on the regular days or weekends. People need enough amount of energy to get through the day without fatigue. The only natural and healthy way of get ride of fatigue is sleep. Many scientific studies says ""Kids and Teenagers need at list 9 hours of sleep!"" having four day of school day a week gives students one extra day of rest. It makes a big different and very important for students health. The final reason we need a four day school week day is to give students time with there parents and friends. parents and students want to spent quality time together but they are not able to because some parents work on the weekends or the students work on weekends. Four days school week is the best solution to this problem. It gives students the attention that they need form there parents and spend some time with there friends. If we can change the old school system by this new and effective four day school week days It will be beneficial in many ways not just for students but for teachers and parents.

If student know that they have homework to do he have to do it on time. However they start failing the classes, they start failing by not turning their work on time, if they do turn in their work on time their grades will drop. They should start paying attention and turn in their work on time. some student also sleep in class, Being to tired may be the case, if student stay up late and doing their work they cant get up on time for school they will get sleep in class and they cant do their work on time. Because of not having time to work, failing, and sleeping in class, school should decide. Student dont have enough time to study. Student grades start going down and then they will fail the class, school should decide what student should do to pass the class doing their work on time, and not sleeping on class. If school want to their student have good grade in class, no sleeping in class and passing the class. school have to make a new law for student, the law is no phone in class and no talking in class, because phone is the only thing that student cant study If they make this law then every student will get a good grade and they will pass their class. Sleeping on time is parents responsibility, not school Parent have to tell their child to do their homework on time sleep on time and get up from sleep on time, then student can be success and student will have good grades in classes. Most of student that sleeping in class is student that they are working after school, and they are working until 10 or 11 in a night, and they cant get up early in the morning so they sleep are sleeping in class, they are not paying attention to their study, and their grades will drop, then they will fail the class.

I feel like older student would help the younger student improve there thinking by getting help from the older students. I feel like the younger student would not be afraid to ask the older students for help. It would help the class communicate to one another. The program would be a success because student helping one another is great seeing them work together as a class having a good time with there class mates. Also the older student are more responsible there also likely to be more trust worthy. They would help the younger student a lot i feel like they would learn more. Then in a few years later the younger student would come the older student and from there they help them as well too. This program would be a great one it would there student a lot.

First reason: healthier school lunch menu can be good for many students who does fitness and also for those who play in the school sports teams, they need to be healthier, for example soccer players needs to be with good weight, so they can play good in their games, but if they are eating things with a lot grease they would not be on the team, because they are not eating healthy. Second reason: The change of the school lunch menu can also be good for those students who abuse eating at home, for that I think the healthier lunch menu can be a good idea, because they abuse eating bad thing at home but, they eat healthier at school, that is the second reason why I choose that the healthy lunch menu is a good idea, because the students are eating better than what they eat at their homes. Third reason: This last reason is to show that the healthy food is better, because it helps students who are with any type of disease whether is a terminal disease or a normal disease, it doesnt matter what kind of disease can be, it just that eating healthy help them for example, there are many student who are with diabetes sometimes they to bring their lunch from their home, because at school there nothing they can eat, because everything may have grease or sugar on it, and that is the reason why student bring their lunch, because of their disease, so that is why I think healthy food can a good option for the school lunch menu. In conclusion, the healthier school lunch menu would be a good idea because it will help a lot students in many ways including teachers, students, and all the people who works a the school, I think is a good idea to be healthy not just out of school also inside of the school, we just want to maintain our habits, and that can be good because, we are doing the right thing, and that is my opinion about the school lunch menu, we just want to improve with the school and doing this we will.",8,7,7,7,7,8,2011,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

It will fell harder and harder every time you failed, and its hard to keep up the enthusiasm while facing different kind of problems. Yes, im fully agree with Mr. Churchill. Failure lead you to success. Simple example about Elon Musk, one of the richest people on planet Earth. He was the Chairman of PayPal, Tesla. At 2002 he invented SpaceX, first ever self-investment rocket company to reach the Earths orbit. Also, most amazing thing is they invented the reuse rocket, which is the rocket will land back to earth after launch to the Earths orbit. SpaceX has accomplished so many that people talk about their success so much without remember their failure. Let me tell you this: The first 2 of their rocket(Falcon 1) launch are all failure due to engine failure. after during a other year of researching, testing, and examine, the 3rd rocket launch still failed to reach the Earths orbit. At that time everyone think this project is a jock and Elon only have the money to launch the 4th rocket. Without losing hope and years of hard work, their 4th rocket(Falcon Launch 4) was successfully launched and reach the Earths orbit. Elon and SpaceX made history, SapceX also received a large amount of money by NASA. Dont ever lose your enthusiasm(Hope). Dont Never Ever Give Up, one of the greatest quote of all time, it lead so many people to success. Like Elon Musk i talked about last paragraph, he is a great example for us. His enthusiasm and passion about Space transpiration in the future and even moving people to space lead him and his company into success. Im a sports athlete, i play basketball for 5 years already, its part of my life. Every athlete knows practice is boring but also important. Why so many people still play professional basketball is because they have the passion and enthusiasm about winning. Process is boring and long, however it only take one moment for sports athlete to fell everything is worth it. Still some people failed on their way, beat by the tiredness of the process and slowly lose their enthusiasm for what they are chasing for at the beginning. Failure complete the adventure, last thing im going talk about today. Everyone is emotional, everyone hate losing, everyone wanted to take the short cut. Im the everyone, you are the everyone too, but without the gaps on the road to success, the adventure just seems not complete. Every failure make the explorer more stronger and smarter. Learn from the mistake, take note from it and you will be step ahead from everyone else. Every person on this planet with big accomplishment also have big mistakes too. No one is perfect, just go do thing what you want or like to do, eventually the journey will become interesting. All for all, guess you already tired of reading. i support my 3 main points: Failure lead you to success, dont ever lose your enthusiasm, failure complete the adventure. Im also agree with Mr. Winston: success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

Firts,Im explain my topic whith details a person who is due something for class always need help for others students for example: All the students have differents opinions,but only one is the leader of the work they must be discuss the problem and star working. The people on the group dont have the same idea that the others have the work is amost finish but is not good enough,they present the work but is not good,the leader say I dont acept this work becuase is incomplete the students talk more the topic and they star working again in the problem. The people in the group never say I dont want to due this work,becuase all the people have to prove her self,they say maybe the work is not good but we cant make this again,you never have to felt that you cant not due becuase you cant grow no matter what happen you cant due again and star again. Second,In situations you feelt that the things that you due or make are wrong ,but in not becuase the all the people in this world have a second or three changes to improve,and if you make a mistakes first is not matter that you have to made the same mistake again,you must be improve your self,world,class,and the people that you have you never have to feel grow becuase that word is not exist for a person who every day is triyng to make a good work. My other example is a person who is guilty to due a crimen and this person want to have a education to grow like a human that we are they must be giving the oportunity to study no matter what he due or make because all the people have the same staight. I know that many people are gona to be upset with me becuase they must think, a person who make a crimen dont need a second change but for my opinion the have a second change becuase they are in jail for the crimen and the want to grow to be a better person. All the people in the world have a second change becuase if you make something that you are not prove you must be make that again you never have to say I dont want to due this or I dont have a might to make this,that is wrong you cant due everything in this world is possible, and I know that this people are annoyance for what I think but is only my opinion becuase nobody want to be in jail and never learn somehing for your future, the people who is upset with me why they dont think if you are in the same situation you have to think in you and also the other people to make this world a little better. In my conclusion, the people have always a second change to grow,the human that we are we have to think in us but also in the others person like example: this text is for a world to make this a better place to live, becuase all the people in this country is fortunate becuase have so many oportunities to grown and be prepare for te future in other hand I come from a country that dont have opportunities but my goal is to be a better person today, tomorrow and for my future.

Lets to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills! What do to improved our talking/people skills, its important to get feedback from others and you dont even know when you need it of not. Like heres an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and doesnt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and its always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But its hard when you are nervous. How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why Im telling you this its because I dont want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more. Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future. Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that its important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future.

I really did not talk that much because I was so nervous about it like how I have to talk in front all the teachers, and students. I wanted to try it but I couldnt do that. This evidence shows that, being in different country and not knowing their language is really hard. My mom, and dad was always trying so hard that one day I will be able to speak English. My mom, and dad were always telling me that ""always be appreciated that how you got to this level, and think about hoe you can make different talents that people can see, so they can improve it on their life."" After that day I told to my self "" I always will be able to be appreciated to my self, and by being in this world."" As always that one day I will show my talent to people that I never thought of that one day I will learn English too. clearly, if I wasnt being appreciated to my self, to my teachers, to my family that they were working with me together. I wasnt be able to even write this essay. now even if I am not that much perfect I am happy that I got to that point that I and my family really wanted. In addition, there is other way that you can show your talent to people by believing in your self that you can get to your goal by working hard as much as you can do it, and as much as possible. So you can see the result of it by your working hard. For Example, my brother Generic_Name, he is in 12 grade, for him it was really hard because he was always worrying about his grades, and he was saying ""how I can get to finish my 12 grade by being a perfect student. He was always wondering about his self, and that how hard will be next year. One day my mom, and dad told him that ""if you believe in your self, by that time you already got this."" this evidence shows that, Generic_Name couldnt believe on his self. Generic_Name wanted to know that how he can show his own talent . He was always worked hard to improve in his new talents or skills. Now he got to finish his 12 grade by being successful. By next year he will go to collage. Clearly, if Generic_Name didnt listen to my mom, and dad he wasnt able to finish his 12 grade by showing to all of his teacher that how he improved om his talents. In conclusion, developing your talent or skill is a different way or different thing that you can bring it into your own life. By being appreciated and believing in your self that change your life, and bringing a smile up on your family face. As always people want to develop new talent to their own life to make them change, different, and happy. Clearly, being in a different country, far from your own family, And you cant see them. Its really hard for everyone especially me with my family. But I got a strong talent that no one can pull me back from it. For bring appreciated to my have that they were working together with me that I can get to this part. Today I realize that how much I improving in own life, in writing, and speaking English. Even if not that much perfect. And like Generic_Name, he believe on his self, and he worked hard that he got to that point. Now he is working hard that he can make this world a better place for his future that is coming up. Clearly, if you want to improve in your own life or in you own talent or skill that is in your heart, and that can show your develop to the people for this world, and it will be applying to your own goals. Always be thankful, be appreciated to your family, teacher that they worked hard for you to learn new things that will persuade you to your new goals. As everyone has a talent to the world, And that way they can change the world too. Always work hard in your life if you want to develop your talent. By improving a skill can make your own place, and your own world beautiful as they can see the result of it at the end.

585,3713,36035C063AB3,"Can many things be done if we are always doing? succeed comes with hard work and hard comes with trying, but everyone has different opinions and points of views. Although others believe otherwise, there is always something new to learn in this world, we can influence others for the better, and we can accomplish more if we are always ready to keep doing something. I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well. If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view. Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too. You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jeffersons quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing.",7,6,7,7,7,7,705,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
586,3714,83165647126E,"One way to improve student achievement is to create a homework club. I think making a homework club is wonderful for students a homework club can help students improve their grades,have more free time, less tired from school, and grateful to turn to that and get help from teachers and students at the same time. First, of all, establishing a homework club is creative because it helps students improve their grades. Students get more work done when teachers and other students are helping them. They also, get to study more and dont have to worry about failing the test. Lets say a student is having difficulties on a question on their homework. A student can stay after school and get help with the questions they have trouble with or needs help with. Also, students have more free time after school. Students have the ability to spend time with their family and friends, and go places. A homework club sounds like a club i would join because after i come home id relax or go out or hangout with some friends. if i joined a club like that id be happy because i woulnt be the only one who struggles on work and we could help each other out on work we dont understand. Furthermore, A homework club helps students less tired. They dont need to worry their grades being bad because they had help from teachers and students. They get to sleep more and wake up the very next day and get ready for school. Students should have it easy because theses days students go through so much in life. Just imagine what their going through right now. Next, Homework clubs and help students on many different things but at least they learn something new. Everyday Students these day try and try the best they can but they lose hope because they feel like they cant do anything. I believe every student has the courage to get something they done just like that. Finally, I think creating a homework club is great for the students because it helps students improve their grades, give them more free time when they get home, less tired from school, and grateful that they have this club.

588,3716,E433745B3F87,"Michelangelo the artist once said, The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark. I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. Its like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that dont really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But theres people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. Its mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot. Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they dont have any papers to work , dont understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind, and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest peoples that end up missing there shot. But there are other peoples that wont let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesnt mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I dont think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us. For sure theres others statement that are more dangerous then this one.",5,5,7,7,6,7,3287,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
589,3717,92FFB3530304,"Im disagree with this statement, that the first impression is impossible to change, because, I have seen a lot of people who doesnt had a positive impression at first, but later they completely changed. They become to change themselves from what they were before, tried to forgot about the negative impressions they had before. if you Have a negative impression at first, and you want to change it, it will be hard, but it is not impossible, if you really want to change it. Everything that you have control of them, and you want to change them, you can do so. It well be hard, but not impossible. First impression can also have a large effect in someones life, if it is a positive impression it can lead to the success, they want to have, but having a negative impression will not only take away your success, but it will also keep you down in your society, you will not have the respect, that you want have in your society. For example; if a boy in a place or society have a negative impression, other people who live in there will not let their children s to play with him, or to go to school together, or even their parents will try to change their children s classes if they know that they are in the same class, because they dont want their children to be like him, or to have a negative impression that he has. As the boy grows up, and recognize that he should change the negative impression that he had at first, which kept him away from his friends or classmates. He will try to change it to positive impression, which will be hard and for him it will be a strange thing, because he never tried this before, but, as he continues he will realize that, how much he was bad with that negative impression, and how much he was hurt, by that negative impression. Having a negative impression at first, and changing it will take much time, but changing this will help you to reach where you want, it will help you to achieve your goals, and it will help you to find a good friends, everyone will try to be your friend, and wants to have a good relationship with you, so you not only help yourself, but you will also help your friends to reach their success or to achieve their goals. Changing the first impression is not impossible for those who have a strong trust on theirselves, and really want to change this, especially, if this impression is negative, because he knows or soon he will know that this can be very bad for him, and can keep him down in school, society, or in the place they live. As, he knows that how much a negative impression will hurt them, they will try to change it. It is not going to be easy, but that doesnt mean that it will be impossible. In the process of changing this impression they will also learn a lot of new about how much will a positive impression good for them what can a positive impression do for them. They will know that having a positive impression is not in everyones luck, those who have a positive impression, on their society, school or etc will have a successful future. Most of the peoples want to change their first impression, because they havent seen any positive result from it; they want to change it for a good future. Those who have negative impression cant reach their success, because having a negative impression is like a wall between you, and your success, that will prevent from you achieving your success. First impression is like the first step toward your goals, so if you have a negative impression it will be almost impossible for you to get there, because having this impression can also effect your lessons, but if you have a positive impression it will be much easier to get there, because you can have more success in your lessons. For most of the people changing their first impression looking impossible, because they are never going to try it, they never want to experience a new thing, or maybe most of them think that this is not that important, but, I think that first impression is also very important in life. It can bring a lot of changes on you it can change you future, your position in a place. I think that those who want to change their first impression should know that, this will not be easy, but if they try, and keep this in mind, that if they bring this change in their life they actually achieve a very big success. Changing this show them that everything that they want to change in their life is up to them, however, it will not be easy to do that, but that doesnt mean that it is impossible. Everything in your life is in your control, and you are the only person that can change what ever you want to change in your life, it just depends on you, that you are going to handle the situation. If a thing come to your life, and you know that, it will have a negative impression on your life try to keep them away, because they can make problems for, they can pretend you from having a good future, they will try to destroy you, so you are the only person who can keep all these things away. For most of the peoples it will be hard to forgot about their first impression, because they have a good knowledge with that, and they think it is good even if it is a negative impression. This kind of people will have a hard time to forgot their first impression. When we try to find new friends we always try to find about their impressions in our life; how can they help us to solve our problems, or how can they help us to achieve our goals. Having friends with positive impression in life will help you to take over your problems easily, but if you have friends with negative impressions, they can put their own negative impressions on you too, they will make think like a loser, because they dont want to reach your success. In my idea those who want to change their first impression, first they have to think why they want to change it, what negative result they have seen with this impression, after they reached the position to change their first impression, they should start working for.

592,3720,2EEEE9C5E227,"Are first impressions impossible to be changed? It has been said that they are almost impossible to change. Most people tend to agree with this statement, but what if they are wrong? I personally disagree and believe that there are ways to make impressions change. Its all about giving the person the opportunity to show and see who they really are. First impressions are judgments we made before getting to know the individual. These impressions can be on favor or against the person being judge. Thinking on ways to make these impressions change, I have found some good ways and these can be; getting close to the person, asking to their close friends about them, asking teachers or other adults. All this based on my life term experiences. Getting close to the person meaning; talking to them personally, this could make a big change on the impression been transmitted the first time you saw the person. By talking to the person you will find so much things and probably things of your interest. When talking to a person you are making judgments in your head, but your mind always changes from what you thought this person was before. Asking to their close friends about them is a risky but also a good idea. Their friends know them better and can provide a good opinion on them. When asking their friends, you should make a comparation on all of their opinions, this would help to know this persons circle. Social circles are very important and most of the time define a persons being. Knowing this persons circle will change that first impression on their social side. Asking teachers or simply community adults will help a lot to change that first impression. Maturity level is something we always judge when comes to impressions. Teachers will tell you what is this person attitude at school. Community adults will tell you how does this person behaves on their everyday living. Whether you find it positive or negative, opinions definitely make the first impression change. People say that first impression only last a very short moment, therefore it cant be change because its just flash judgment on a person. On the other hand we have people like me that believe that as long as you have not contact with that persons circle, you are still in the first impression and it can be change. Getting to know an individual, Talking to their friends, and others adults opinions are all first impression changers. Overall first impressions are possible to be change and we need put these steps on play. If we would to follow these steps we would not be hating on each others and will live in a better world.",9,9,9,9,7,9,621,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him "" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything. Another thing is that not everybody make it, is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad dont going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so thats why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life. In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

597,3725,8AB55CB5992E,"There was a guy who decided to eat a ghost pepper because of a dare and next thing you know it they are in the hospital, not so good isnt it. One day one of my friends Generic_Name from a while back lets say elementary school, Generic_Name was eating lunch and some kid came by and swiped his tray off the table, he wanted to beat they other person up and I said no I suggest you go talk to a teacher about it. Although some might believe, asking for help (guidance), talking to your priors or family members, having confidence in yourself proves seeking for guidance from experts and authorities about life important matters is a good idea. Asking for help and guidance. My friend Generic_Name was having a tough time choosing which college he wants to go to. I told him to go talk to your counselor and now hes now in Generic_school because he asked about what colleges seem good and are better for Generic_Name. This relates to asking for help because he had no idea where he wanted to go if he made the decision to go some college, having no background knowledge of the school and he got there noticed its not for me, he is screwed. That means it is a good idea to ask experts at finding the right college for you. Talking to your priors, family members and communicating. I always ask my friends and family what to do for certain things such as what classes do you think seem good that I also like or what sport should I join and try out. I think communicating is great because it sets a good outlook on your personality. Thats how you make more friends like you want to know what good advice they can give you and you can give them. People who dont communicate will always have a tough time talking to people, they will be really quiet and lonely at times. This relates to talking to priors and family members and communicating because they are here to help you out no matter what. Having confidence in yourself. If you start communicating and talking a lot more, it will build up confidence to the point where you wont be nervous to talk in front of a class. One of my good friends named Generic_Name came to Generic_school awhile back all quiet and had a soft voice until he started talking to people like his friends and family everyday, now it sounds like he is a whole different person and he is way more confident in public speaking. this relates to the having confidence because he was scared of talking to people until he starting talking to everybody he saw in the hallways and built his confidence to a new level. Anybody can overcome the fear of speaking just by talking with your family first then friends and people you dont know. Whats important is that you learn to talk to people like your family, friends, and your school administrators. Some people have a bad past in speaking to one another but it all comes down to are you going to make a change because that person who has difficulties in speaking, doesnt like it either. I want people to overcome their fear of communicating in the future because thats a big deal if you dont, many jobs out they need people to speak well with other folks. This relates to stuff in a political aspect basically media because people on there need to speak to one hundred million of people out in the world on TV.

601,3729,A68AABEAAB4B,"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they dont treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that its a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer. My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I dont feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really dont want to leave them (the people here are great). In some reasons the people dont treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didnt like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didnt want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didnt even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didnt tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun. The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they cant control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he cant control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem. Well now that we sow all this I think that I am correct people dont always be be perfect, everybody makes errors in life or someone causes them. Thankyou for hearing me today!!

When you are trying to accomplish things and make friends, it can get you hated. First off when you open up to people and be honest with them, they arent going to like it and turn on you and hate you. when they see you succeeding and doing better than they are, they will talk about you because they arent where you are and they will make you try to feel down and unsuccessful. When trying to do good things in life people will down really low to the point where you give up, and just try to fit in and do bad thing that could lead you down a wrong path, to where you can end up in prison or dead you can end up in the wrong crowd, when you thought they were good people.

The programs include some activities that can be complete during the three years, taking place in summer or after school. Student also cannot take elective classes, they need to take the necessaries to be able to graduate with all the requirements. This programs give a lot of opportunities for students. This is a good idea for student to finish high school in three and enter to college or the work force one year early because they will be able to be educate younger and earn time. Students have a lot of labor opportunities in jobs if they are able to finish their education early and being younger. For example, to work in a company; normally the company employer wants to have young employees, but at the same time, employees with experience. If students finished early they education they can begin to work earning experience and skills. Having a positive result for their capacities and opportunities for be selected or contract to the jobs. Also young people have more physical resistance than elder people, in this way they can permanence working more time and harder. This kind of opportunities are benefits for their future employments.

By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion. First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are. Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school dont go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesnt have money to pay for college/university or who doesnt want to be dependent to his family. Some families dont have money to pay their childrens school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly. Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed. In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students.

I agree with this statement because it lets you know that anyone can push for a higher acomplishment in their own life. As well, reading the passage gets people thinking on their goals, if they should push to reach for higher limits. Ill tell you why Emersons statement is right. As a start, many people are inspired by Emersons statement and its made them believe more in themself. Having a powerful statement can really open other peoples eyes to strive for high goals. As well, push boundries that they never thought they had. People with start to have faith knowing they can rise above their own expectations. For example, many people give up and stop trying to reach their goals. Then they have no idea on what they want to do or what they can manage to do. In fact, people who past beyond thier own boundries have a successful life style. They start to know what they can handle and how to fully succeed, It make them feel like they can complete any type of task that theyre given. People start to feel better on themself knowing what the can do. Some people say its a weight lifting feeling they get once they find out what they were missing out on. For example, people ened up over thinking things and made it harder on them self for not achiving the goals. As a matter of fact, People end up gaining more experiance on what they do. They also start to want to take on new challenges so they can have more experiance. They want to be filled with many different ways to have a strong mind and successful life style. People who has gained so much experiance can get any type of work within seconds because of their experiance, nothing has ever stop someone from believing they can do more. For example, people with the most experiance struggle less for work. In conclusion, Emersons statement shows a strong componet in peoples lifes.

611,3739,038480498E5A,"Dear Principal, I think that it is a great idea for you not to allow students that have a C average to participate in sports. My first reason, is because a lot of kids who have good grades such as B s and A s they dont get as distracted in school. Therefore, they will be focused better in their activity, and not in doing something like homework. People who have C s, D s , and F s they will not be focused in the sports activity because they have to worry about doing homework and getting their grades up. Because they are responsible for having bad grades they shouldnt participate in school activities. Maybe you ask ""What if someone has the potential in playing but doesnt have the grades"". Its probably because they get to distracted, in playing sports and not doing their work. Kids who have bad grades tend to be lazy, and if we let them be on the team how can we expect to win if one of the members is not even participating. Another reason why, you should have good grades and be able to participate in activities is because it will look good when you go to college. There are more chances for you to get into a better college that you will like. And when you get a job you will get a well paying job. In conclusion, that is why I think the principal shouldnt let students who have a lower than a C average participate in school sports activities. One because they are lazy, and not well focused in school. I think it will be way better if kids who have good grades get the credit for participating in both sports and class work. These are my reasons why I think students who have B average should be involved in school activities and kids who have a C average shouldnt.

Its a great idea for students to get a head start on college and the workforce one year early. Students that get an earlier head start plan on starting their careers while in college. The jump from high school to college is way different but its a better step for students. A friend of mine had finished high school earlier and got to start college earlier and now their life is going to start because they went on the right path to start their career. Colleges offer programs to students to help them get their degree like Masters or Bachelors degree faster so they can achieve the career they were trying to achieve. Many colleges offer this program as one of my family members is going for their Masters and they are going to get it a year earlier than majority of their classmates. Some students have already been into the workforce already and now they would like to finish high school and become a full time employee instead of a part time employee. Students that are still in school that already work cannot make more than 40 hours due to the fact that they are still under the age of 18. Full time employees make more than 40 hours but some of those employees still go to school due to the fact that they are balancing school and their work life. Studentss that are in school are either a full time student and part time employee or a full time student and full time employee. Some students in school majority of the time they work put their schedule as everyday at a certain time or they work weekends. Students finishing high school early is benefit for the students that would like to finish early because they want that head start in life. They want to start college so they can get started on their future career and get that dream job. Students want to become a full time employee instead of a part time employee so they have more hours and get better pay to go to college to be a full time student and full time employee. For these reason I agree with this statement that its a good idea to finish high school early to get into college earlier or into the workforce.

613,3741,D2E545CFEBF3,"I would agree and disagree at the same time because their can be good reason and bad reason of why it good to extend 2 hours of school and working for 10 hours each day. My first reason is that it good extending the 2 hours helps you learn more things and catch up with any work. What is good about Working for 10 hours each day is that you will have money for colloge and save up. What is bad for working 10 hours is that you will be tired and sleepy. For example if you work four-day week you should work at least for 8 hours only because you need to get enought sleep, leave some time for home work. But it also can be good because you can only work for four-days and rest the week days. Working more than 8 hours you will feel tired,sleepy and frustrated. Therefore it better to work only 8 hours instead of 10 hours because it too much,as a result you can get bad consequence or bad grades. My other reason is that I think school should not follow this model because working each day 10 hours it too much. However their can be bad consequence of working 10 hours and extendidng 2 hours in school. My first reason is that you can be tired and not listining to the teacher while she teaching. Second reason is that if you extend the hours of school many student will be livid for staying more hours in school. I think that the school should not extend the hours is because some teachers need to be in places too,needs to rest and also needs more time on grading papers. I also think that many students have part time jobs and also they need to be somewhere. Some students will be tired and sleepy. Another reason I have is that student needs to go home early to go do their homework,rest alittle. ",5,5,6,6,4,5,2928,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

I strongly agree with Albert Schweitzer, a good example by your own behavior the best way to influence other people. Because it represents your positive qualities and as well as culture, and help others understand more about you. One reason that people should behave positively, is that they can represent them selves to others. As an example, people with positive behave draw others attention by the way how they physically act and speak. They are easy to convince, open to everyone, and humble. In my real life experience, I have met a lot of these kind of people who I consider as friends now. I was influenced by them the first time we met, with their positive attitude and respect. Another reason why reason that people should behave positively, is that they can influence others by their culture.

615,3743,AD53B357BD0D,"Have you ever had a really important decision you had to make? Did you feel overwhelmed because you didnt know what you should do? Asking for help or advise from people such as friends and family around you can really help alleviate all that stress. Most people encounter big decisions often throughout their lives, so getting advise from numerous people can help you get more input on something, and may end up helping you make a final decision. Seeking multiple opinions can really help someone make a better choice when dealing with decision making. One way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is that by asking more than one person, they can get more input. Asking numerous people can be a huge help when making an important decision. Not only are people getting different ideas of what they may want to do, they can also get advise from people who may be more experienced than themselves. For example, if someone was debating on which college they should apply to, they may end up asking people such as older siblings or parents for advise because they may have more experience with that matter. By asking multiple people, you can get multiple ideas, each of them being different in their own way. By getting more peoples input, you may be able to start to make your own choice about the matter because of the advise youve gotten. Another way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by not getting any biased opinions. By asking more than one person for advise on a subject, they can get more than one new idea that isnt one of their own. This way, they can get more than one persons thoughts on the decision, and have different ideas on it. For example, if someone were trying to make a decision on what sport they may want to tryout for at school, they could possibly ask their friends and family about which they should choose. However, they should also ask people like classmates and teachers, as they may have their own ideas, and wont give the person any biased ideas or information. Friends and family can have a great deal of influence on people, so its important to always get peoples thoughts that are on the outside. This will make it to where theres a greater chance of the decision maker not being biased, as theyve heard numerous peoples thoughts, and can make their own decision off of that. A final way seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice is by being more prepared about the choice theyre going to make. The decision maker can use all the advise theyve gotten from different people to make their own choice, and feel better prepared. They will be more focused as they know what they want to do, and will feel more confident and less overwhelmed. Feeling less overwhelmed can be a big help as the person doesnt have to be so worried, so they wont have any distractions from making the best possible decision. For example, if someone is trying to decide what kind of car they want to get, and theyve gotten advise from numerous people, they can make a better choice when picking. Theyll know exactly what they want, as theyve heard many thoughts from the people around them, and so they can make their final decision. After getting advise from multiple people around them, the decision maker may be able to make the best choice possible, as theyve gotten new thoughts and ideas. Asking for help or for some advise from those around you can help you make the best possible choice because youve gotten a lot of new information and opinions that you wouldnt have gotten if you had only asked one or no one at all for advise. Making an important choice can seem a little bit easier and less stressful after seeking advise from multiple people. Getting help from others around you can help you make the best choice you can.

616,3744,35CF1B2B1326,"I think, with that changing 4 days of work in a week have disadvantages and some benefits. because people will not have time to live their normal life or do work at home, they will use the same amount of energy and resources and people will not support to work many hours in a day. In addition, people have already their own routine to work, even thought if some busines try to change work days. To began, people will not have time to share with their family, also working 4 day a week for 10 hours will cause problem in your family, children in those time do not have enough responsibility to be home by their self, even thought, people will not have time to do work at home. For example; to clean their house, to go work after school and to coexists their problems or thoughts with the family. And to do other works at the end of the day. Second, working 10 hours a day they will use the same quantity of energy and resources because is the same sum of hours that all people work, if they work 8 hours a day for 5 day, even that people may use more energy, because the rest of the week people will need energy, as well to work 10 hours a day will use the same amount of resources, to make up all the works that you need to do. Lastly, people will not support working 10 hours a day, because many people have their routine to work, or some of them have problems working to many hours, another reason why people can not work 10 hours a day is that they have their own routine work, as well student in school will not support to be in class. For example many student gets bored in class juts been 8 hours in school and if we compare there will be a lot if issue with their attendance. another point is many student work to support their self, so in that occation they will not available to work and make money. To conclude, to work 10 hours a day is to hard for many people and they will try to work less hours in a day, because they can not have time to share with the family, also they can get sick for being working to many hours. even thought on this times some people worked 10 hours a day, but at the end of all that working to much can cause serious problems with your health.

617,3745,21EFAE02832D,"I believe students should design summer projects instead of teachers, what do you think? i believe so and here is why. Most students think more alike other students because most of them have the same knowledge than others but. That doesnt mean that the whole school will have students that could think like teachers. By all means this proves that there is a lower chance those students with high developed knowledge will be the ones doing the summer projects for others to complete. The students that do create some of the summer projects will make sure not to make them to hard or to easy that way the students doing them can surly keep learning during break without stressing about it. The students that make the summer project will also make them easier for there fellow classmates. Some of the students that are doing the summer project could be stressing about it but that also means they wont make it to difficult because they would want to get over with it already and focus on something else to get there minds distracting. So that we they cannot be thinking so much about school. As well as the students doing them wont stress as much about them because theyll know its not to difficult and can do it any time during the summer, such being the last week or the last day so they can have all summer to them selves. Not having to think about school. When students arent thinking about school that doesnt mean theyre not learning it, just means theyre trying to get there head off of something that highly stresses them about a lot of work or having to deal with for a long time and thats the only time they can get a break from it and not stress about school. The reason being of students doing them than instead of teachers they also wont have to do a lot of writing or work for starters. Students will be sure to not make them as long because they know what it feels like to get assigned a long and stressful assignment especially over the summer break that is the only time you actually get a break from school. Students also doing the assignments will help out teachers to also get a break and focus on other important related stuff they have as well. The students creating the summer projects can also be more open minded after doing them and grow theyre knowledge as well as learning better and thinking of ideas more often for school. Teachers can review the students work and see how fine they do. The students who do well creating can continue to do so if they feel goo about themselves doing it for the other students that werent so bright at it can give out ideas and help out the students doing them. I believe other schools and principals will be impressed by having a school with students creating theyre summer projects and that is wonderful. I believe that having students create the summer projects is an outstanding idea for the community and school they will think of them differently and have a better picture of themselves. This argument has been good because it will open the eyes of many students and have them be brave enough to put themselves up for the challenge. If you believe students should create these summer projects instead of teachers write your own prompts to see what you guys have in mind. I think my argument is well stated and many teachers will surly think about letting it happen. Dont you believe so as well?

You should always try to strive to become the best you can be. I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Like they shouldnt disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that cant help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if its little people sometimes dont ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help.

619,3747,34D76C62269C,"If you still attended school, how would it feel to go to school the whole year? Just have off 3-4 weeks of summer break, maybe 2 weeks of winter break and 1 week in fall and spring break. Well I can imagine that and just imagining that makes my head hurt. Just having to come for 8-9 months of school is hard for some students and I would think that less number of students would come to school if we had a year-round school. Just having a normal school year(8-9 months)is amazing. Although some people say that having a year-round school is a amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year, actually having a year-round school is not a great idea because students would have less stress about school and also students would try harder when they come back from summer break. Although some people say that having a year-round school is an amazing idea because that way students would not forget what they had learned over the year. Also because students would come back after 3-4 weeks and still remember. Having a year-round school would give students more time to learn all the material they have to know and more easy and faster. also have more opportunity to get better grades because you are more time in school. I read in a article that it said that the more time you spend in school and focus the better it is for you in the future. Having a year-round school has advantages and disadvantages such as being more time in school,less time being out of school, maybe less school activities, less summer time , etc. Many things can change when the school changes. is always better to keep the old way than start a new way and not be successful. I think that not having a year-round school is a good idea because students would have less stress about school. Students wont be as stress because of school the whole year and only a little bit of vacation. Stress can be something bad not just for students but for everyone. Stress causes illness such as your head hurts,back hurts, feel like not doing anything, etc. Not having a system of school like that can give students more time for vacation alone or with the family. Having a 3-4 moths of summer vacation is enough for you to have a really nice vacation with family or like I said before alone. school causes a lot stress for students and having to come all year is more stressful. enjoying your summer is not just about one week or two is about having time for yourself and family. also not having a year-round school would make students try more for the next year that they come back to school. When students have more time off school it makes them want to come back. Students want to come back and start the year. Some of them get so tired of being at home that they just want to come back. Also being on regular school break students enjoy more the summer than just 1 month or less. They have more opportunity to go explore the world and everything. Much more freedom for the summer. When is summer students cant wait to leave school but when its like 2 months out of school they want to come back. Summer is the best season for a student because is when they enjoy most of there time with the family,friends and having fun in the summer is the best memories and maybe the best memories they have with friends and family. My best memories are the ones in summer that I enjoy mostly with my family. In conclusion, some people say that having a year-round school is great because that way students wont forget what they had learned over the year but I think that having a year-around is not a good idea because students would feel more fatigue than the usual and also when they come back to school they would feel more comfortable and ready to learn more again. Being out of school is a great thing but when you are almost done with summer you just want to go back to school and see your friends and than is the same thing when you are going to summer you feel so excited that you just want to be done and not come back but is the same feeling when you are coming back from summer to start the year.

As a result, more ideas are developed and productivily improves. Working together prepare students for future jobs and careers. Two or more people are always better than one for solving problems. However, it is an importan skill to be able to get along with others and it is valued by employers. Everyone has heard people saying ""Two minds are better than one"" This quote has never rang more true, and all of the ideas it promotes reflect crystal clear off a group work. Working in a group can reduce the amount of work you need to do, as well as make things a lot more efficient. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group, and people with differents skill sets can do what theyre best at. This broader range of skills can also be used to help other group members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of the most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. Though multiple ideas are helpful, and it is less work to be in a group. Sometimes working alone is beneficial as well. It really depends on the circumstances youre placed in, and the people you are around to say wether or not working in a group is benign or unremunerative. Though working alone can be better for ones own reasons, such as anxiety, paranoia, worry about others preferences, or simply because you prefer to work alone. Oftentime students will learn and experience more in group of their peers than working alone, which is better for the futures and possibly what lies ahead. Working together creates less work and allows more work to be completed faster. It allows constructive criticism from other members of the group, which promotes a better final product in the end.

625,3753,F2CB99D1FE9F,"Dear Generic_Name, in our school is common to see many students working in groups. I would like to tell you that by working in group I can get a lot of benefits. For example, getting a good grade, having a chance to meet new people, to know more about my classmates and even make new friends. I believe that working in group is more beneficial than working alone. I think that having the opportunity to meet new people is really important. When I meet new people; I feel inspired, confident and happy. Because most of the time I like to share my ideas with other people. Although, not all time they will feel related to my ideas, but thats one way I make new friends by demonstrating my interest. I also like to hear peoples ideas and stories. For example, I like to hear peoples stories about their life and childhood. I personally like to get good grades on school projects. I think that when I work in groups I feel more confident of what I am doing. I also do my work on time, and I even put an extra effort on my task to get a decent grade. For example, If I make a mistake my teammates will let me know. I will learn from my mistakes. If I make a mistake does not mean that I didnt try, I always try my best every day, to be a better person. So I can not complain that I do not have support because I do have it. Some people say, that working in groups is not beneficial as working alone, people usually complain that they easily get distracted. But I think they are wrong. Because working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. When I work in groups I receive the support from my teammates. But when somebody is working alone they do not receive any support. So I think that working in groups is an easy and beneficial way to do my job and get a good grade. When I work in group theres a lot a benefits I can get: I can meet new people, hear new stories from new people etc. If I get a school project and I have to choose whether to work alone or work in group, I will choose to work in a group without thinking twice. Because I have experience how good it feels to work in groups. Sincerely: Generic_Name ",7,7,6,7,7,8,3600,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
626,3754,F3550CF50ABC,"Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us. Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. For example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. What most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school. Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. For example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. A lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. Since society has made it seem that if you dont look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that youre not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character. Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others. I urge you to think about your character if its formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.",6,6,8,6,7,6,3605,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
627,3755,1B056DE0E856,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" unless you try to do something beyond what you have already master, you will never grow."" But i thing that when people work hard on something, even thou they all already don it, but they did poorly on it, So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. For example when i was in eighth grade i had a lot of tribal how to spell in English, because i was from another country, could Generic_City. So all the time i could not spal a ward, so i will get sad, but in the minet or two i say to my self "" dont worry"" so to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again. First, Work hard, people work very hard in something because they want to secid in the futurr. When some one bin doing something for so long even thou they did moltipal times. They can do it again, just to be batter ate it. They never hive up on something, because when some one haves up on something that they bin like in it, they will fail. Think positive about staff because when some people dont thing positive. Even no it`s hard for them to desalt what they what to do in the future but they did the same thing over and over, but when they work had and have that positive mind they will do it well . For example, my first year playing soccer on the high school teem, it was hard for me to understand what people was saying to be, but two three years later i had no tribal understanding what they war saying to me. So that shows that i speak English for three years and know i can understand what people saying to me because i bin spike net for three years. Second, Dont wary about staff, stay on track. People like to do something and finished, because when they finished it fills much better then before. When i take a test it makes me woride but when i finish it, it fills much better because my mined can relax form it. Even thou i still think what Caind of graid will get. Fist Complete the staff that is hard to do then do the easy staff later. When some people do their home work, they do the hard problems first and they do the easy staff, because it helps them to counchenteit on the hard staff first. When i have a problem that is very hard i will ask the teacher for help me with it, so that i can do the easy staff by my self. However, Some people ,like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson think different then the other people. for example when some one has a high school digry they just want to get out of school because if they did it again they will think that they will fail it. Most of the people like to finish something or accomplish something so they work very hard just to get that one thing like the pay check or college digry just to finish the last staff because they don`t want to do it. again because think that it will me waist of time. Some people look only for one thing but not the other. for instens that young man wants to play profashanal basketball, but he not thinks about school or nothing he just wants to play basketball and so when he tries out for a team and he never maid it so he just going to have up because he never grow to be a profeshanal basketball player. It dos it matter what some people do to, to be batter at something that they going to do it again but they will never grow. Therefore what Author Emerson try to say that people if the have already mastered ,you will never grow. So to say that people can do something that they want to do and they can do it as much time as they want to and they will sicsid in it. Even thou it hard, but some people can do it multiple times. So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. So to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again.

It allows bulling on the internet. It also allows trolling on the internet. First, Technology interferes with student social skills. For example, the student walks into the class room they are in their phones 24/7 of the day. In the class room the students are on the computers playing video games instead of interacting with one another. In a way people are trapped in their own world it stops people from learning about them self and others. Second, someone can post a video to make a person feel bad about them self attempt suicide. Or a person can post a picture where their drunk and they post it on Facebook and tag them on it and on Instagram. I saw a video on YouTube. A girl from Australia is getting bullied online, and at school also on the intent and her family had to move at lest 3 time because of this issue. Lastly charting rooms where you can meet serial killers. fake news post on Twitter spreading rumors for an example Michelle Obama is running for president in 2020. The limitation, First, it percent the young generation basis social skills. Secondly it allows bulling on the internet. Lastly it also allows trolling on the internet. In my opinion we should turn off our phones for at lest 1 to 2 day and going out to eat with our friends with out our phones. In school teachers should wait for students out side the door with a box so they cant use their phones during class. So on bulling last longer and that goes beyond the internet so in conclusion should be more stricter, technology limits people talking about their issues.

629,3757,A4BBB301E3CE,"I agree with what Winston Churchill said because it is true. Going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm can help be successful in the end because you tried and tried again and it gave you more confidence to go on and try things you havent done before. When we fail we learn from our mistakes and try again and be successful because failure is actually helping you in the pursuit of success. On the pursuit of success we will have some hard times ahead of us, and does hard time are the mistakes we will end up making and form does mistakes comes success. For some people when they try new things the only get it once without any mistakes. But for other people it takes the a few times before they can get it, that is going from failure to failure. Failure helps thousands of people become successful in life. When you are trying something new, you have to happy about it, and when you fail doing that new thing you should still be happy because it is your first time doing it, and when you fail you always get a second chance to do it again, and when you fail the second time you get another chance, it will keep going until you get it at the end and giving up is not an option. You should always be happy about trying new things. And when you try new thing and you fail and you give up strait away you, are not being successful, you are just ruining your life an becoming a failure because you gave up strait away. Once again giving up is not an option in the book of life. Giving up ruins your life. In life there will be challenges coming your way and you should take those challenges head on and if you fail try again and be successful, because out of those challenges comes a great price that takes you to the next level. Going to the next level is a big thing in life good things start coming your way and more people start to like you because of the challenges you went through and failing helped you become successful at the end of those challenges.

633,3761,78C22313F58E,"Generic_Name ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL. Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, I think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students cant be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money. Many students cant be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when theyre sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldnt be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too. Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school. Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support theyre family with money. In some cases the student can have family (kids and wife) and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family. In conclusion, schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get theyre work done on time and also save money for them self.

Some student have things to do after school like they have a jobs go to after school ends, I have a friend that has a job he go to after school end and to go right away or he will be late for work that can lead to him fired. I have art school after schools ends and I need to be there on time to finish part of my art work that help me get in to college. Some of the student may have go to an importent event that has a time on it like a funeral in a diffrent state and that can lead to get behind in class work.

635,3763,EF45D0314A20,"Almost 95% of people goes to the beach or swimming pools, and I imagined what enjoyable activity to do. I think swimming club is the most enjoyable activity. Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever im mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever im swimming. First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever im mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didnt want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm. Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I dont really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each others head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and its more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when youre struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isnt fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends. Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because its mpre exciting to exercise when youre swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didnt like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You dont really see the result, until you started having fun on what youre doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didnt see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didnt lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didnt see those changes. After all what ive been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life. Its more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever im mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this.

Many students can benefit by considering this new idea for students to take classes from home by the way of online or videos. Although, many other students would not be agree with this idea. In my opinion, I am not agree with the idea for students to attend classes from home. First, if the students are in their houses they would have more distraction, for example; they can get distracted by the food, many time food is a big distraction for students to concentrate in classes. They can also get distract because of the television, they can see something interesting in the TV and they would quickly get distracted. Also one of the biggest distraction for everyone is the cellphone. If a student is taking classes at home; no one would be responsible to tell him/she not to use their cellphones. Second, they would not take it seriously. They would feel free because they are in their houses. Sometimes they might take the classes; and sometimes they would not take them because no one would be telling them to do it. They would feel allow to do whatever they want because they would not have the rules like in a classroom. If the student is in a classroom; he/she receive more information, more examples, more attention, and more help. Every teacher has rules in their classrooms; rules that help students to be successful. And third They would not be able to learn as much as they would in a classroom. They would not be able to ask questions and get the answer they would need. They would not receive as much attention as they need. However, many students support the idea for students to attend classes from home. It can be considered a good idea for many students; because they would not be traveling from one place to another; it would safe them time. Also many times when there is a bad weather outside; many schools cancel classes; because they cant travel. And by considering this idea for students for students to attend classes from home would help them; because even if is raining or snowing, they will not cancel their classes. Therefore, many students agree with this idea because is not only going to safe them time; it would also help many students. Many students do not have transport. Sometime they have to walk or even pay so that they can go to school and attend to class. using the online program would give them a big support. In conclusion, considering the idea for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video can be a good or a bad idea for many students. I do not support this idea. Students should not attend to classes online or video. Students can get distracted easily by anything or anyone in their house. Many time studying at home give students many issues; there can be many people at home and too much noise that the student would not be able to concentrated and will get distracted. It can also happen that watching a video and that theres no one there to explain it; can make the students tire and he/she can fall sleep. Also, students will not take it seriously because theres not a teacher telling them and explaining them what to do. They would not receive as much education, information, and attention as they need. My position on this issue is to maintain the students attending to school. The students will learn more if they receive classes in school. Attend classes in a classroom with a teacher will provide students more support and it would help them in many ways to be successful in the future.

637,3765,101576652D3B,"The British naturalists and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. I agree with this statement because people should know how to make decisions themselves instead of relying on others to do it for us. Although we are surrounded by people who influence us ever since we where young, people should choose their own character because people should make decisions by themselves more often. Everyone isnt the same, and we shouldnt always be taught to follow what we see everyone do. Its important that we make choices by ourselves because by doing so, it makes us stronger humans beings who can rely on ourselves and helps us gain self confidence and makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do. Even though Influences help you know whats right from whats wrong, people should choose the person they want to because the people you know might be setting bad examples and you wouldnt even know that theyre wrong because they told you its right. For example, growing up, your guardians could be anyone. They could be good people, or they could be not so good people. Its our job to use common sense and decide for ourselves whats right and whats wrong. Its always good to use your brain and decide if something is morally right or wrong. If you see someone close to you being a bad influence, then one must learn to not replicate those actions, but instead make good decisions their selves. Some might say that influences help if youre lost or confused in life, however, another reason why people should create their own character is because attempting something on your own and not succeeding helps you grow as a person. For example, if you just follow what everyone else is doing, you wont learn because thats the equivalent of you being spoon fed. If you dont attempt anything of your own, you wont know how to do anything by yourself. By always letting people make decisions for you, you wont be able to complete tasks on your own and makes you a less independent person. This is why making your own decisions is important. Not only does it help you grow as a person, but it also strengthens your mind. In life, people often rely on others to build the person they are but in reality, its better to rely on yourself instead of others to make decisions because it makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do, helps us avoid bad influences, helps you grow as a person, and strengthens our minds. All of these things are why we should all grow up by making our own choices and decisions instead of mindlessly do what everyone else does. People have all the power in their selves to be who they want to be. Youre no one other than yourself after all, and thats the most important thing to think about when choosing our own character traits.",9,8,10,9,8,9,215,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

As a result, he was trying to do something that someone else wasnt doing, he was trying to grow up someting that should make big changes in his life, and in his family.

639,3767,CA11FD3CAC43,"Many people have been told about the fact that the students should know the career they want in high school and learn about it. Therefore, many societies around the world, are expect to provide help to the students to find the career they want to study by the time they enter high school. In fact, many schools select the courses for the students based on the career the students choose. In addition, many schools think that the students should be young when they think about the career they want, just to make sure that they will not change their minds in the future. So, it is a good idea to commit to a career at a young age. Based on that, students will have time to prepare themselves to be ready for the career they choose. Students will be able to make sure that the career they choose is good for them. If students are prepare at a young age for the career they want, then they will be able to enjoy it. For example, I want to study interior design, therefore, I have to take art classes to learn about colors and how to combine them. If students choose their career at a young age, they will be more prepare and have better results while complete their life goals, because life goals are very importat to have a good lifes quality. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose. It should be a good idea for students to know themselves and what they like, because it is unpleasant when a person have to study what the parents want him or her to study just because they could not have done what they wanted to do. So if the schools support students to find the perfect career for them, then this disagreeable situation will stop. In many cases, people that had to choose a wrong career have to deal with a unhappy life, because they do not feel well in their jobs. Once again, if students have the schools support, they will be able to find the perfect career for them. In addition, students will learn about the career and how it works. It might not be noticeable for people the fact that nothing is how it seems, some careers might seem to be easy and be hard, or the opposit, the career might seem to be hard and be really easy. For example, it is easy to judge a lawyer when he do not win a case, but we have no idea how hard the work he did can be. In my 19 years in this world, I learned that nothing is as easy as we want it to be, but if we search information about what we want to do for life, we will be happier, that is a fact. Schools should require an essay in which students can write about what they like and what skills they have. So, students should know what they want and what they are good in. If students learn about the career they want they will have the opportunity to be great professionals. If the students start learning about the career they want at a young age, then they will have plenty of time to prepare themselves mental and phisically for their future career. Also, students will be able to see if they like the career they choose so they do not regret it in the future. And last but not least, students will have time to learn how the careers work, so they will have many ideas of how to complete them. In conclusion, it is a great idea for students to commit to a career at a young age by the time they enter high school.",9,8,7,8,7,7,2748,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
640,3768,20A2147B6DB8,"On lifes important matters is it best handling by yourself or seek help? Theyre two types of people, one follows his or her own ideas , and the other seek guidance. I strongly agree getting help form a expert or authority is much better than following your own instincts. Reasons are teacher and therapist; Both help out a lot in peoples life. For example my friend Generic_Name and me. Therapist help me when I was going through hard times. My family had split up, a good friend pass away, and I got bully in school, so many confusing and terrible events happening which teared me apart. Trying to work so hard fixing everything by myself, but non of my ideas work. Until I talk to a therapist about my problems. The therapist guide me to a better understanding of my life, and what to do next. Together we solve my problem with the bully in school, and help me got over my family split and my friend death. Secondly, my friend Generic_Name is a senior in high school. She was never good in math, nor did she pass the math SOL. Generic_Name had chances to retake the math sol to graduate. The next one she taking will be the last SOL . Generic_Name study on her own and worked very hard. She like to be self-reliance But at this point it was not working, so Generic_Name ask her math teacher to help out before the SOL. The teacher saw Generic_Name had a lots of mistake, so the teacher guide her to fix it. Also teach her on the math problem she didnt know. Seeking guidance form the math teacher help Generic_Name pass the SOL. In conclusion getting help form experts or authorities help, in ways being self reliance cant. Seeking guidance help a better understanding of the situation, less mistake, controlling stress, and learn something you did not know.

Because i really like and also thirst for be a nurse and i think nurse can help a lot of people. First, i usually learn some knowledge about nurse in books or online. Theres some books that people write their experience about how could they become a nurse, how the nurse job looks like and also some story that they have met. Actually i know, its a hard job to learn, even my first language is not English, it become harder. But when i see the story, see the interesting experiment, im fascinated. Sometimes, i also go to find some volunteers about nurse, it always help me learn a lot that i cant learn from the book. Second, i think to be a nurse is arrogant. People always say "" Nurse is just like an angle"", they help people from disease. As i said, i have read a story that makes me shake: Once in a night, the nurse was ready to finish her work, but suddenly, a man run in to the hospital and theres blood in his arm, he said somebody want to hurt him, that nurse keep him in to the restroom and called 911 first, she try her best to bind up his arm, she wrote in the book"" Im so scary and my hand was shaking, but soon i clam down, i know im the hope for him"". This story makes me have different understanding about nurse, this job can even save peoples life. What a mighty job it is! In conclusion, i hope i can get this opportunity, this hospital have high opinion in VA, and theres more projects that can makes me learn.

644,3772,86ECF13FEDEF,"Why I disagree that first impression are almost likely to never change overtime? Well,In this world many people have experience bad,nice,and fake first impressions. Why because people have a bad feeling about you, you are not aware of what is happening in their heads, and maybe they just wanna take advantages of your personality or who you are. One, First Impressions that I deal with everyday is give nice impressions with my friends. However, the person need to be interest on the topic youre talking about or just be goofy. People sometimes come up to you and smile and said hi or was sup because they know youre alone. If you wanna make new friends or have the respect that you want you only got to show them your nice impression. For Example: In the movie Everything,Everything the girl couldnt go outside because she could get sick,but the new neighbor his name is Generic_Name and he decided to smile and said hi through the window. She smile back to him and then she went to bed. Two, I have experience bad impressions about people being rude for no reason. They bring a side of me that when they said bad stuff they think that I am going to stay quiet. I just give them the same energy back because nobody deserved to be treated on a bad way when youre trying to just said Hi or want a new friends. If your in pain or suffering dont take out your anger on others cause for a first impression you going to be looking like a bad guy. For Example: If a Hispanic kid decide to ask a person for the class room number and that person start to laugh in his face the Hispanic kid gonna feel oppress and feel bad. People dont realize that by first impressions you could win the whole world, but no people like to be hard and act childish. Three,Fake Impressions make the person to take advantage of your opportunities and your personality. The person wants attention all the time but then start talking mess up things about you. I have experience people making fake impressions when they said Hi they look at you a certain way that you know is wrong. Fake Impression led you to think that the other person is talking behind your back. The person pretends to like you, but in particular the person dont care about your feelings or the friendship. For Example: My Ex BFF a year before we stop talking we meet and is was fun, but until I left to VA she decide to not care for me,text me, or call me. That hurt me so much that months past by an you even feel better without that friend because since the begging she was giving me fake impressions and I didnt catch on. In conclusion, Sometimes you need to calm down before to start speaking to a person. Be nice and never let negative thoughts on your mind that are going to make you look bad. Let people talk to you first and then think about their first impression. I been nice, but sometimes I gotta get mad with people cause they dont even know you and start calling you names but is not worth it to think about that cause that said a lot about their first impressions. First Impressions will never change cause once you speak whatever come out your mouth is gonna stick to that person forever. You know that you when accomplish somebody smile or laugh thats everything to them is important that is their first reaction and by First Impression you can win the world by been nice all the time and make new friends or win the respect that you deserve or them.",6,5,6,5,5,5,1784,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
645,3773,DC77E1C50756,"My prompt is about how everyone has a skill or talent and I have to identify a talent or skill that I have and explain how I develop and use it. Well Im an Athletic girl. I play different sports during some seasons, for example when soccer season has ended. Another sport Im kinda good at is basketball. I play sports in school and outside of school. A few other things I can do is sing and dance. Im going to start with soccer. So I started playing soccer in 2018. I dont really remember my age but I do remember the year. When I started playing soccer was when I lived in Generic_City. I played there for to seasons. I played in the spring and fall seasons. When I played in the spring it was the best thing ever like Im telling you I literally fell in love with soccer at that time. My team was a good team we were called the sharks. I was number 14 and I was happy because thats the number that both of my cousins jersey numbers are. Anyways, we won a few games and lost a few ones but we always played good, we gave our best, and we gave it all. After, spring season ended I played on the fall season. Im going to say that fall season was okay it wasnt as good as spring season but I still enjoyed it. My jersey number changed in that season so then I was number 16. I havent played since 2019 ended but I will start playing again pretty soon and Im really happy and excited. Now Im going to talk about my basketball season. Last year in 7th grade I was in Generic_School and they put up the girls basketball season was coming. I was interested in it so I decided to sign up and try-out for the team. I cant lie try-outs were rough but at the end of the day I gave my best and it was fun. A few weeks later they put up the paper of the people who made it and I saw my name and I was so happy. Anyways, that season ended, then school ended, and I moved to Generic_City. School started a few months later girls basketball season started. I was happy so I sign up. I went to try-outs for the whole week. At the end of Friday which was the last day of try-outs the coach Generic_Name told the girls who made the team and who didnt and guess who made the team MEE!!!!. I was so happy my friends and I celebrated on the way out. The whole season was great, I made so many fun memories with the girls and I was just so happy. My third skill is dancing. I love to dance everyday. Like Im always dancing in the car, shower, kitchen, my room, just everywhere. I love it and I enjoy it very much. Its something that could never leave me. Im going to start taking dancing classes so Im very excited for that. One app that I always use to dance is Dubsmash it has different song that I can dance to. Im always dancing to a song in the car when a song comes up and it has beats I just be going crazy. Finally, the last thing I love to do is sing. Singing for me is just very enjoyable and calming. I sometimes get on my feelings and cry but its just because they are really good songs and I cry because Im happy or sad. I love to sing the songs of Sydney R. But my top favorite songs to sing are All of Me, Into you, Love dont Change, and How you gonna. And yeah these are all the stuff that I do as a skill or talent.

649,3777,1348668DF845,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early? School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years. If they allow high school students to graduate in three years , they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL. In any other state would agree on graduating high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating for high school. Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation , and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years. It would be a a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL , as a student i would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and i would not like to take courses during the evening , it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work. People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work so they can graduate faster in 3 years .

For example Bullying is serious and negavtive effect on us, Bullying isnt just physical contact there is cyber bullying and thats were the technology come in. Another negative effect that technology has given us is No Contact, The new genration does not have contact as like people would have had before. We need contact becuase it shows that we can work with people and it also shows that we are social. One positive thing about technology is new research for example now a days we can just go on google and search up things we might need help with, For example if you are confused over a topic or you want to know a little bit more about it you can just go on google and search it up. Another positive effect technology has given us is Locations, Locations is a part of everydays life for example if you need to go somewhere you can just go on your phone and search up the name of the place where you want to go. Technology is something we need now a days because theres creations all over the world being created everyday. Human contact is what we expect but now a days we cant find that because it either go on snapchat, instagram, or add a friend on facebook even adults do this not just kids and teens. Human contact is something that we need everywhere in life we need these things at work,school,sports teams and more.

656,3784,759E0659FF69,"A city council is debating the adoption of a 10pm weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. does curfew help teenagers or not help teenagers. Curfew is a bad idea because curfew do not help teenagers on weekday and also the weekends. My tops three reasons are stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can get in trouble. When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didnt check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys. When my friends drop me off at my house and i open door of my house than i saw my parents sleeping and the next day my mom ask if i came back to the house at my curfew and i said yes and i got always with it. Teenagers also sink in/out of the house. Some may say that curfew help teenagers to be home on time. They are wrong because most teenagers sink out of their bed room window. One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she couldt sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didnt our parents. Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had. When teenagers are in trouble the person they go running to is their parents because they know they something bad and now they need help for it. On a weekend my friends and i are doing weed in one of my friend basement and her parents catch us doing weed and her parents told my parents. When i got home my parents were in the table and we all talk. My parents told me to stop doing weed so i did but few years later i was doing weed again and again they found out somehow. We talk about it now i stop doing weed for good. Curfew is a bad idea on a weekday and weekends. Curfew do not help teenagers on weekdays and weekends because they can stay out more, sink in/out the house, and they can in trouble.

657,3785,0A324290AFE7,"I disagree with his statement, because if your good at something you can always put more effort in to it , and you can also be better at what you are good at, and last you can never stop growing of what you mastered . people in general they always get better of what they already mastered . First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, im good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve. Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking. You can be better then someone ; become better than that person that you want to challenge, or you can challenge yourself. Challenge yourself is a good way to grow. Perfect takes practice; be good of right now, but become better in the future. Taking your time and taking it slow, you can 100% be better. Trust me its not easy to be better that you have already mastered, but theres always way and a chance. The important thing you need to know is you cant not stop growing; you can always keep on growing even though you are already good at it. Only because you are already good at something doesnt mean you stop growing, you can keep growing, if you try a little harder. I will always try my hardest to be the best at it; no matter how hard it is. There is always a way to keep on growing. If you show others that you can be way better even though you already good so far, they will see that there is a way to keep on growing. Show an example to others; let other people know that it is possible to be better, at something you are good at. Prove to those people that thinks you cant keep on growing of what you already mastered. You will not grow, if you dont put more effort in it, and time. If you just stop of what your good at, then you will not grow. Remember you can always grow of what you mastered. Dont let anyone tell you that you cant. practice comes perfect. Do all the things you need to do to be better, then you will grow more then you expect.

658,3786,A495DAE52B0E,"There is two ways of working at school, one is to work alone another is to work in groups. Many people choose to work alone because it more quiet, the grade they get on the activity only affect themselves and not other people, and not distracted from other people around them. but i prefer working in groups to be with friends, get things done more faster, and more fun. Working in groups is a advantage because the people on your group can help you in many ways like to know something you dont understand, or when you need help they can help you in what you are straggling in. in one occasion when i came to the united states i was at school and that day our teacher told us that we have to do a project and she gave us the option to work alone or to work in groups, so in that time i was a little scared and afraid to talk to people since i didnt know any English and i also was scared of people to not be able to understand me because i did not know any English i knew some words but not a lot, but a girl name Generic_Name came to ask me if i wanted to work with her and her friend, and i said yes, it was a lot of help working with them because i didnt understand anything the teacher asked us to do and what the project was about but they help me a lot to understand everything and to learn a little more English and to develop my self. Working with other people it more easy than working by yourself. people can get things more faster, and more good because more people more ideas. Getting things more faster is beneficial, teachers can give students extra credit in their activity or project. Also students would be able to know how to work in groups in their future job, to make friends, to become more independent, and to be nice. working with other people would get people to know how other people feel and to get to know more people to become friends. My first day of school i was afraid to not make any friends because im not a social person, but them i become friends with a girl name Generic_Name because of a project i was doing with her, and since that day im still friends with her. One of the reasons why people like to work in groups is because a lot of people are really nice in many ways. working in groups is a better idea than working alone because when people work in groups they get more social and to be able to know and to conjugate with other people. Being nice to other people it help you to make friends and not getting people mad at yourself or dislike yourself and to make things fun and good. when i turn 16 i started working at a restaurant called Generic_Name i was a little scared because it was going to be my first job i didnt know how things were. but when i started i have to be nice to costumers since i was working on the line. but one day i was sad and mad at someone about something they said, but that day i was working in a project with some people and they started to be nice to me and make me laugh so my day can get better so the reason here is that working in groups can be a lot of beneficial because that day it was a really busy day at my job but because of the people on the group i was working with, they made my bad day to a good day. Working in groups is a lot more beneficial than working alone because people can get things done more faster, make new friends, and more fun. i really hope our teachers can give us more opportunities to work in groups than to work and do everything alone because it really help a lot of people to become social and more independent and to develop themselves.

Forcing someone is not good because you cant tell someone do things that they couldnt do. Some people dont like playing sports, working the yearbook, or serve on the student council. Not everyone have the same opinion, but many people have different opinion. Forcing an students to do something probably make them feel that they have no rights.

Because I get to practice my singing skills,I can learn from others,and also I can perform in from of people. I can do this by staying after school so i can practice more skills,or ask the teacher or students for help when I need too. I think practicing your voice skills is very important if you want to enjoy the chorus class because you can get alot out of it. Ones youre out of the basics you can get more advance classes. Secondly i think learning from others can help you because if you dont know something that other student knows you can ask if they can help you. Also seen what other student might do you can get an example from them or you can do what they are doing for you to get better at it. Also when it gets to performing in front of alot of people I might get nervous because Im not use to that I might even forget the lyrics of the song that Im singing ,but ones youve done alot of performs you are not going to be afraid of going to sing in front of alot of people. In conclusion, joying a chorus class can be fun because you can be with your friends or you can make new friends,and you can learn your singing skills,you can also learn from others and ask for help when you need too.

663,3791,CDCE16D2C836,"Boom thats the sound of a volcano that just erupted. An enjoybale educational activity for me is a volcano because they are intresting and an excellent science expirement. The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. Ive always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I dont need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. Its very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people dont have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people cant outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times its amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study. Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because its very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. Thats a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project. In conclusion an enjoyable educational activity is the science project of a volcano and i gave my two reasons why a volcano is a good educational activity.

665,3793,840D73A3804A,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what youre gonna say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful. You know why? because youre a action taker, and not just a dreamer, who just expects stuff without the hard work. You also get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because youre more active, and youre more unique, than most people. My first reason is that if you just put that action into movement, then youre powerful already. No one can stop you, because your mindset is on a whole new other level. People cant ketch up to you, and people will be jealous of your success. You will have haters. Hate on you, but dont let that slow you down! keep doing, and achieving and great things will come down to your way. For example:There is a saying that If someone is hating on you, then youre doing something great, if theyre not hating on you, then youre not doing anything really. My second reason is that youre a type of person willing to do anything to achieve your goals. You will let nothing in your way. You are ready to grab life by its neck, and just yank it, cause its yours. You gotta take over your life now. Dont wish, and wait. Start now, and dont let stuff handed to you. You gotta work for it, and just love the process. Trust me you will not regret it, if you just start making good habits for yourself. For example: doing your homework, and stop procrastinating on the stuff you need to do, or want to do, doing tasks when you dont feel like it. You will be great, and youll thank yourself in the future. My third reason, and final reason is you get more noticed, and people will like to be around you, because youre more active, and youre more unique, than most people. Ah, yes nobody likes a person thats just ""normal"". I find that quite lame, and boring. They would like a person that is quite different, and not the same as everybody else you know. For example: You wouldnt want to meet the same people every time now would you? of course not. You would want to meet different people, and find new things, and also most importantly learn new stuff by different people. You would want people with different personalities, not the same ones, as that would be boring. You are more active, than just sitting down. You are taking your chances, and not blowing it. You are taking advantage of life, than just wasting it. Nobody wants to hang out, or deal with someone that is just negative all day, or a loser. They would want to hang with someone that is quite active, respectful, and successful. My conclusion: Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? I believe that if we do more, then we get more things done. I say that because if you just do what youre going to say, rather than talking about it, you can get very far in life, and you will be successful.

A person never ever should be shy for failing to handle this situation. No one is successful in their first experiences, even in their 10th-20th experiences. This is how a person gain experience and learns how to go over this first impressions. Because they already faced it and went over it. Yes, the first impressions are important and it could be shocking too. But a person can easily change this first impressions with his/her ideas and experiences. The person already has his/her own developed ideas that could change it really fast, also has experiences that will help to go over the first impressions.

670,3798,01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like. Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they cant stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions. Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law. I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well. In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",6,8,6,8,7,6,18,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

672,3800,E733508EEB84,"I think we cant compare between businesses and school because these two themes are different in how they work. To fallow this model of conserve energy and resources we have to know the reason to adopt if this model can benefit or not the school , following this model the school can confront many problems also can have many benefits but there are many reasons why the school have to follow this model and why school dont have to follow, First, we will talk about the disadvantages, extending two hours to the school days will be weary for the students, students will gonna be tired in the classroom and thats not benefit the students, if having eight hours in a regular week students feel tired, so adding two hours to the class days will be disastrous to the students. Students, teachers would be affect by this changes the reason why can be affect is because they will not have time to pass with their families or things that they need to do after school. Many students from school works to help their families or because they are living alone and they need to work to provide their personal things, so they will not have time and thats will be a reason why they can left the school. Students from the sports teams, club members will be affect because most of their activities are after school,so if the school adopt the new model that is adding two hours to the regular calender all they can be affected because of time. Teachers also can be affect because they have personal life they need to grade the students work and in this new calender they cant do all. People who works in schools will be affected because they will have one day off of their regular week. Parents and Students will not feel comfortable they can be disagree with this change and this can cause conflict with the school principle and this can bring many other conflicts follow this model can bring many changes where the students can be benefits by this change of the new calender, also teacher people who works in school can be benefit. One reason can be the four days of school that means the students will have three days off. Students can have more time to do the homework because most students work during the weekend and they dont have time to do the homework so they will have an extra day to do all the things that they need to do. students can learn more and this can be a reason to change the calender, adding two hours to the schedule will help the students because they will have more time to learn. Also teachers can be benefit because also they have to evaluate the students and they have just the weekend to do that and that is short time , so they will have one day to grade and do all that they need to do. all the the people are benefit because they have time to pass with their families or do whatever that they need to do, a lot of students work so they can work in this extra day. In conclusion extending the school days and the four days of school week have many benefits and many disadvantages . As we can see there many things that can benefit the school but also there are many disadvantages . I think the school have to be stay with the same calender, actually the schedule works great so I think there is no reason why we have to change.

679,3807,7C5E4E2779BF,"Im agree with Emersons restatement, in my point of view or personality I can say that I want to be a different person with another qualities, create other ways to think how big or how much I can do to show to the world my authentic and proper knowledge, when I have to make a decision I dont have to think too much about it, I believe in what Im doing. When you think to be a real person and someone different to the rest, you need to have a plan that consist step by step and develop that plan in the course of your life to make goals to short time and large period of time, be patient with each little detail that you want to do. For example: If yo want to do something that you think that is impossible for any reason, you dont have to leave that idea or goal that you have in mind, remember that all you need is work hard, be simple and dont complain for any problem or reason that tomorrow will have a lot of consequences. At this time, the people and no one wants to see another person having their own goals or their dreams that they had when they were children. Every single person will try to impress to your attention to turn down your attitude and your positive life, I have too many experiences that I never want to pass that process again, in this world exist all type of people that want to help, to destroy your intention or the ways to see the real things, youre a guide and an example to change the format in this age. When you have a purpose that everyday make changes in your personal life or something like motivation to do anything that that have a great value to demonstrate to you family that they are the base to all of your goals have worth. A big percentage of people want to be rich, and my way to think about it, is that all thing thats material it doesnt have a real value for a great and humble person, the value is something that makes you having a great family, a simple life, because the world need to be protected by several and carefully people that are interesting in show another face to represent a different type of humanity. Be an individual person is how you you can to do to confront the reality and give another perspective to make a great research in your your period of life to change or keep using that type of life and really cares about what are you doing with an specific and central idea.

My conclusion for this restatement is that I want to be myself with great intentions to form an integrity in this society and have the best recognition to prove that its possible to make and develop a proper identity with a new perspective to imagine and be the next person in the world that makes you a connection with your interior and have peace to concentrate in own goals that will converting on a genuine person to be autonomous of your acts, be someone responsible, charismatic and all of these characteristics define your personality it doesnt matter where yo come from or where you at, just be an example that if I can do this, you can do it better than me and better as you want.

682,3810,5DA3135B6664,"Ralph Waldo, Emerson, wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond hat you already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with Emerson statement these are my reaason why. First, i think if we do not prepare for more than one thing. We never will grow up. Second, have more than one knowledge than other people always will be advantage. Last, if we do not try more than one thing that can be more hard of that we already know. we never will grow. First reason,i think if the people do not prepare their lives with more than one knowledge. Their lives will be without direccion, and with less opportunies in our society, becuase they will do not have the enought knowledge to play a good job. For example, if they are looking to find better job with new experiencies that will be impossible to find for them, becuse they do not have the knowledge which one is require for the position. how they can be productive for the country or society. If they are not prepred to make done specific job that can be important. Second reason, when we have differents knowledge our lives help us a lot to find the best or easy jobs. The knowledge is the most power thing the human being can have in thier hands. Some people think the knowlege is something that we can not buy from any where. Exmple, if you focus to learn. you always will be have advantage to grow. Last, i think if the people never try something hard they never will grow. we always need to try something who will bring new experiences on our lives. Exmple, when someone is goint to university and the person graduated from teacher, but if he stuck there, and not go for more hard profession he never will grow like principal etc. Conclusion, i agree with Emerson statement, because he give to us expecific ideas what is life about when he said ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow. this is why i agree to his statement, and i provide all this reason.

The things I have learned in todays day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think its hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you dont learn if your not taught in life. Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse wed be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. Youd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesnt blow up on you. Id love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again. Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because its affected my everyday life. Through this Ive mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me. All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you wont grow at all. The human brain is meant to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

Sometimes you have to be flexible for what you have to do like if you work and go school if you try to graduate early you have to be able to stop working and focus just in school. Students need to be flexible for new things and face in the best way. Like if you find difficult in one of your class you should ask your teacher for help.

People hurts someone feelings because they made something really bad even if a person tells them that they are doing wrong things, they keep doing it, because for them the decisions that they are making are great for them. One example, lets say, when we were young that we fall a lot time in love. we were wishing to have someone to advise us because we think if the decision that we are going to make is not going to hurt someone. We always think about what is going to happen if we do things that we know are not good choices. We need somebody to advise us about anything. Another example, when I was planing to leave my house with my boyfriend because I did not wanted to go to school. I get really mad. I did not think on anything. I just wanted to do it even if Mom gets a heart attack because she wants me be more educate and have a better future, so someone that I have not seen in my whole life get close to me and say "" You are too young, think about what life can brings you if you go to school, if you graduate from college that many wonderful thing you can have. Do not throw your life in that way. You will have time to be with someone"" I realized that I was making the worse decision ever. Everyone always need someone to be agree about their decisions, because someone may have a lot of experience about life that way they can be the guide for them. they can talk about the decisions that they were making in the past and that can helps to make a good decisions. One example, one friend made a bad a really bad decision. His family told him to stop doing the things he was doing because it will be a lot consequences. That is what happened he made a wrong decision. He did not listen and now is dead because of his decisions. Most think that they are old enough to take their own decisions, as we can see, it does not matter what age we have. What matters is how mature we are, because we have to be aware of the responsibility about any kind of decisions we are going to make. We have to say to ourselves "" okay if I do this I have to be conform about the result that I am going to get"". Clearly, All we do is because someone is making us better by telling that we do not always have to trust on ourselves. Sometimes for some discussion we do not do the right thing, we do not think and we use our bad mood and due to that we make bad choices. We have to be more responsible. "" Make good choices, do not let your mood take position of your actions"". Think before your decisions.

687,3815,570595740274,"Do students need summer break or they can handle not have summer but with more breaks around the year? Students need summer break because students like summer more than other other times in the year because is hot outside and it doesnt snow all the day also, during break some students can do things that they couldnt do because of the school. For example have a job, just enjoy and relax outside with family and friends or have big families plans that they were expected, students have more odds to do all that in summer because. They can put all their effort in their jobs. almost all the students that I know have summer job in fact I actually have two summer jobs. For students have a summer job is actually very important and it means a lot because it can be the first thing that they actually put all their effort, and is not only the fact that they put all their effort it can be the fact that they can be helping their family for example. Their mom is having a bad time at work, the sells went down, is being two weeks since the last buyer went to the store, is not something new at the store that could bring buyer, and is being a bad moth for their mom, their son will try to help her paying small things like the internet, the water, the light or he could actually do his best, paying all that and paying the rent of the house, some teenagers not only work in summer for their own good some teenager work for help their family with everything they can however. Sometimes they need relax, doing nothing or going out to eat, watch a movie with friends or family, or go to party with your friends and enjoy summer how I said, I have two summer jobs. The first one is in construction and the second one is in a place called Generic_Name. My first week doing all that I feel tired and I feel that I couldnt do all that anymore but I realize that my family needed me and I keep doing it, in my first work I actually learn a lot about how to measure things and how to use a electric hammer also my boss is my uncle so I spend good time with him and I meet some really nice people. The second one is in Generic_Name I had to take care of kids, clean the place and make food, I meet really nice people there that helped me a lot and I realize that I like work with kids. However some students dont have a summer job and that is fine, some students likely have some family plans or plan with their friends that they want to do for summer like. Go some to another country with you parents, sometimes parents have vacations at the same time that summer start if they change the vacations it will interfere with the time that students spend with their parents. Some students actually dont spend a lot time with their parents in fact I am one of those. our parents work to 8 AM to 8 PM and when they come back they are tired and they just wanna eat and go to sleep, and we understand why they are like that. In summer we spend time with out parents we go out to eat, we go to the movies or we go in a travel to another country that is the first reason why student prefer the vacations in summer than in another time of the year the second reason can be. because of the sun, we all have to accept that we get tired of the cold, rain, snow and frozen rain we all get tired, and we want the sun also with the sun your garden wont die or it wont look ugly. Sometimes when we have summer some times another school from another country or another state have summer that means they could come here or we could go there and spend time with them. I actually have some friends from Venezuela and every time they have summer they come here to spend summer with me however. Yeah sometimes it can be hard retain information but students need rest for while, spend time with their families and friends, and if they want it or they need it get a job and do their best. Can they change vacations for another day or just have more different vacations but not that long? No summer is not only the time where students rest, also is the time when they spend time with their parents or friends, it can be the time for some students to work and help their family.",6,5,7,7,5,6,1124,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
688,3816,9685DD18847A,"Some students dont have an idea of what career they want to take when they enter high school. Family members and teachers expect students to know what career they want when they enter high school, so it can help them choose the classes they need. I think students should have time to choose what they want to major in. One reason I think students should have time to think what they want to major in is; they can get tired of the career they chose or change their mind of what career to take. For example, my friend Generic_Name is in AFROTC, she has been in AFROTC for 3 years. In her Junior she decided she wanted to leave AFROTC to do something else, she wanted to do nails instead. If Generic_Name can leave AFROTC her scheduled for the next school year can change. She will have to learn how to do nails and learn the more, difficult, ways to do them as well. For this reason it will be good for students to take their time and find out what they really want to take. They have all of high school year to think about it before they entering college. Another reason students should think about what they want to major in is, they dont know what career to take or they could have many options but can not chose one. One career could be too difficult or one could be fun but not earn has much. Students should look over the careers they want and see if it is right for them. For example, I have 3 careers Im thinking about but can not choose one. I have 1 year to think about which one. For me photography would be the one for me as I like to take pictures of the most beautiful places in my home town. I would also like to see other parts of world, see beautiful people who live there, work with amazing people, and see what I can take a picture of. i also want to the world to know what is going on fromw the different parts of the world and not the news. i want people to see it not hear. Some students already know what career they want to take. Most of the students are thinking which one will be good for them, and which suits them the best. It is good for students to know what career they want, but it is also good for them to think it over or think it through. As students already know what they want to do and go straight to college. Some students like to take a break and not go to college right after they leave high school. These students are taking a break to figure out what career to take, what college to go to, and save money to be able to go to college. This can help the students in many ways. In one way if the student does not like their major and think its too hard it will change major. The student will keep changing major until it finds the right for him/her. By taking a break the student can think if he/she really likes the career they have chosen. For all of these reasons I do think it Will be good for the students to take their time on choosing a career. They dont have to have a hard time choosing one or changing the career for another one. If they dont have an idea of what career they have a lot of time. They can take a break and think very well about their options. It can help them from not changing majors when they are in college. Students taking their time for choosing careers is good for them and will help them choose the right career for them.",8,7,8,8,6,7,1991,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
689,3817,A79D997C4B42,"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around others. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new. Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the ones to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase thats what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do. Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learns something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start. Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group. Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy.

690,3818,E060D90D6CB9,Dear Principal I dont agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress. If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishments in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything. If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldnt have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea. I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future. Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me. I wouldnt like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note.

691,3819,FAB189F7E4DF,"Have you ever do something bad in your life , and your friends influence you to do it ? well everybody has two types of friend one with good behavior and the other with bad behavior. But the teenagers of this time never think in consequences when they are following bad examples. So I believe that a good example by your own behavior is the best way to infuence other people because people learn things by examples, or if you get together with somebody who is not a good influence for you believe or not your are going to learn what he does. People is always around you they are always looking what you do and they are criticizing your actions. My first reason is because good behavior is the best way to influence people because if you are a smart person, educated , and happy your are going to be a example for other people and they might said that they want to be like you. Many teenagers has ruin their life for following bad influences. People can said that we are old enough to know what is good or wrong but we never think from what is coming. The world is full of bad person and some people would ask their self, why theres too many bad people in this world? the answer is because people is influencing others to do bad stuffs. If human wants a better world for their kids they have to be good influences, good examples to the new generation that is coming. In my own experience I have seen friends and relatives that has ruin their life for getting together with people that is a bad influence for them. Is really sad when you see somebody that is in jail or dead for following bad examples by having bad friends. When you are following a bad example that person never is going to tell you what are the consequences. As you can see babies when they are in the age of learning new things they do what their parents do or what they teach them to do. Adults and teenagers are a little bit different because not all the time we do what people tell us to do, but we always end up learning something of that person. People is always criticizing so if you dont want to that happen be a good example. Being a good influence people would trust in you, but being the opposite of that nobody would trust in you. And when we realize is too late because the people you appreciate are separating from you for been a bad influence for others or maybe for them. My grandma always said , "" what you crop, you would sow."" For me those phrases mean a lot because being a good example or having a good behavior will take you to succeed in life , and is not just that there are many ways to succeed in life too. For these reasons I believe that a good example is the best way to influence others so the people that is learning or looking what you do can learn good things about you and by that wat can trust in you. Also you will feel proud of yourself that your are influencing other in a right way. If you want a better world be a good example for others and dont lose your time in influencing other in a bad way.",6,6,6,7,6,6,3792,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The older students knows a lot of things more than younger students because the older student knows how to read, knows how to do math, and knows science and social study. But, sometimes older student might forget about things that they were taught in elementary school. Also, theres some new ways that the elementary student are taught in a different ways because it would make it easier for the younger student to understand it more, or the younger student is taught something new and they can help the older student understand what this new idea is, and the older student teach new things for them to know and be papered. When the older student teach the younger students, they want to papered them because when they start a new unit and the younger student heard of what the unit is about, they know and understands them and will get good grades,and the older students wants the younger student to be papered for next year or this year, also the older student wants the younger students to improve their grades and their test grades.

A problem is a change for you because it can make you see different and help you to understand how tings wok. First of all it can make you see different then the others. For example i remember that when i came to the United States i think that nothing was going to change me because i think that nothing was going to change me because everything was different that my country and then i realist that wrong because a problem may change you but sometimes can not change the way it is, but i remember that i was really shy but i think that change a lot because sometimes my problems make me think that there is more thing that i never see in my life but i just need to see it from a different way and dont let nothing happened and ruing the change that i want to make because of just a problem. For example i think that nothing was going to change me and that i dont need to be shy anymore became i need to start seeing everything in a different ways because you can get mad at every one but you need to know what is going to happened after, people may see you different but the only way that you know how to change is to do the best and dont let nothing or not body to change nothing about you. The way you want to change not one have that and cant do nothing about it because is your choice and your problems and you can decide what to do with it. second of all can help you to understand how things work. For instance my mom have a lot of problems but she have faith when she is around people, my mom is scare of high and im not scare of high i did not understand why my mos is scare of high and in not scare of high and every time i see my mom in a airplane it make me laugh because she is scare and is funny, but i see it from a different way and i like the high but also she have to understand that hoe things work in other people because it can no be the same as you. For example i think that my mom and me are different because we are and i have to understand that she does not like high and i need to understand that. to help someone to understand how things work you need to start to see how things work in that persons life. A problem is a change for you and can make you a different and help you to understand.

696,3824,6DB65C457200,"Students committing to a career when they about to enter high school is by far a great idea. From elementary to middle school students are allowed to choose what they want to study toward a specific career or what they want to be. When kids are still in elementary they can say what they want to be, but they can not choose the class for the specific reason because they are still kids. But when it comes to middle school students they can choose what class they want to take for a specific career they have in mind . Student can commit to a career when they enter high school , but they do that when the student already know what they want to be or what they want to do by the time they enter high school so the student at they would be committing to what the student want to do so the person doing so chooses the class the person want to study . Students committing to a career is a great idea when you really want to do it . Committing to career When elementary students are in 5th grade they start carefully thinking about what they are gonna do, because when they are in 5th grade it their last year in elementary school so they have to think about what they want to do. When they enter middle school and that when students from elementary school start thinking about their choice and taking their career choice serious ,because that when they start thinking what they want to do in the near future. Elementary students have 4 years where they take class that are chosen for them in the 4 years they study just to get good grade ,but they do not think about choosing the class for themselves .But when it comes to 5th grade they still study the class that are chosen for them except that when they start to think what if I could choose the class that I want to study for my career or what kind job I am going to study to be able to get that job and that how they start committing to a career .when it comes to elementary school students. Middle school students are commit to career because they are teens and they have to think about a lot of things that they want to do personally when it comes to career or what they want to be when they grow up that when they start .Committing to career start in elementary , but mostly it begins for real in middle school because that when young teens start taking class like algebra,earth science,biology ,world history, etc . When middle school students start taking these class students think only about passing so that they can not repeat that class and some just want to pass the class but mostly it about passing the class so that they can be able to get credit, and that leads to taking the class the will help that person career or what kind of career they are into. When looking you will find a lot teens thinking about their career .The career they want to commit to and some teens do change want they want to be , but still they are committing to it and they can just change if they do not want to do it .For some reasons young teens around the world that are still in middle school are already commit to a career and that is a good thing right most of them are really into it , and they are taking their career far enough .So far like 10,00 teens are most famous because of their career that they are doing now and they take serious because they like and they are good at it mostly middle school teens. These days they are unstoppable for what they do sometimes they are good more than adult at committing to career when it comes to what they want to do in life. Some people might argue that students identify a career by the time they enter high school , because they think some students can not do that when it comes to committing to career they think that young teens can not do it .Because technology has taken the mind of teens .They say that teens can not do anything because all they think about is technology and all the things they do they always use technology so some people do not believe that teens these day can commit to anything i .Many people believe that it is hard for teens to commit ,because they can not take responsible of what they do and some think that they are so imature .When it comes to committing to career the parents thinks it how they act at home that why they can not commit to career and some thinks it how they behavior when they are in school .Some people believe that teens can not commit to a career ,because they do not know what to do and some thinks that young teens can not do it because they changes their mind most of their time on settling on what they want to do .Bunch of people believe that teenager can not do it because they quite so early and so easily anyway a lot people do say that can can not be a good generation because they do not know what to do. But it doe not mean that all teenager are bad some might change when they grow up and some might not change ,because they just do not want to change consoling the thing they might have gone through so for these people.

For these who believe in change I as well believe in change people do change and they can commit to what they want to commit to as well as job, career,family or love. People believe in what they want to believe in so I say that commit takes responsible ,but I know that we teenager can change the world and show them that not all teens are the same and keep believing in what career you want to commit to because committing is not an easy thing to do expressly when you are a young teen or kids .I know people say that we can commit to what we want ,but not everyone is good at committing to a career when it comes to young and committing to something that is big than your own head or mind.

They want everyone to be kind and no wasting act of kindness. My oppinoion I wold at least do one to five act of kind ness a day to make someone happy. If you do a act of kind ness you might get some to say something good about to make you feel good. It is nice to do in genral. You can feel good if you gave some a complement of there self and make them feel good. You can make someone day because they might have had A bad day and you gave them a complment and that make them feel good. I think the auther made this becuase they can make people feel good. The ancinent greek is relly old and they were doing alot of act of kind ness. The ancient greek story teller said no act of kindness no act of kind nees shoud never be wasted no matter how small. I think Aesop is a ancient greek king That can tell people to do act of kind ness.

698,3826,49D2A80F1484,"In my opinion disagree. Because some people said that is hard, take a lot of time. For example you gotta know how works all the processing, and people do not understand, so some time is very confuse. So in my opinion that first impressions, are very wrong because no everyone wants to be like different. Secondly is very impossible to change because people do not have time to take care about that stuff. Also because they work they have boobies, shores, take care of their family so is very difficult to be part of that. But also people said that first impression is bad because is impossible to make right. In addition, some people said that take a while to get used it because you need to be sure, to your goal come true. Also you have to work very hard, and if you do not have enough, time you not are able to get it so that mean, you have to work hard. Example like people said that impressions, are almost impossible to change well, for some reason it should be easy or hard we dont know. In conclusion, I disagree because impressions, is not easy to take care too, many work in little of period of time so it will take me for ever to do it correct. But also people, said that is very hard and is total true so impressions are very hard to take care. ",5,4,5,5,5,6,966,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student dont undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student dont work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

Both have benefits but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students.",6,4,5,5,4,5,2681,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
700,3828,192D02CF8C9E,"Having good attitudes is the best way to successes. There is two types of attitudes : a good attitudes and a bad attitudes. Good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing, for example you dont agree with your boss about your paycheck, one thing that you can do is talk with your boss with a good attitude and get to a agreement or talk with a bad attitude and get fire. Good attitudes can also help during a bad or boring times. For example, you and your family are having a bad time in a trip and then you go with a great attitude and make everyone feel better. Some ways that you can be with a good attitude are : when you sleep well, when is sunny outside, when you get a gift, when you go to your favorite restaurant or you got your favorite food , when your friends go to your house, when you visit your family, when you go to a trip and your having a good time, and so many other ways. Bad attitudes can take you to the wrong path. A lot of people have bad attitude almost all the time and its really difficult to get along with them. That type of person does not have a lot of friends or they dont have friends. One example of a bad attitude is when you came to school with a lot of stress and a bad attitude and your teacher do something that you dont like, then you star yelling at him with a bad attitude and your teacher send you to guidance and you get a report card. Or maybe someone else is with a bad attitude and wants to fight and that can go really bad. Some ways that you can get a bad attitude are : when you are tired, when you got a lot of work, when its raining and you cant go outside, when someone else got a bad attitude with you, when you are mad at someone, when you are hungry and the food is bad, and some other things. When I am with good attitudes I always have the best time. Some thing that make me have a good attitude is when I got my favorite food , or a present , or when I am with my family. For example, yesterday was my cousins birthday in a really fun place, I was with a good attitude because I was playing with my cousin and then we ate really good food. Also I am with a good attitude when my family and I go on a trip, I love to travel because we can visit a lot of new places. Another example is, because my sciences teacher was with a good attitude, he give us one more day to turn in a project. There is so many benefits of having good attitudes. One of them can be when you got a important exam and you study and feel secure about it, then in the next morning you woke up with a good attitude and you take the exam felling secure about your self and with a good attitude, you are going to get a good grade. I think that the best one is having a good time because you are happy and being happy is the best felling that a person can have. In conclusion, having good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing like in work, school ,and even family reunions. Now you know, the next time that you are felling bad or having a bad time the best way to handle that is having a good attitude.",5,5,6,6,5,5,338,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Therefore, when you walk in the park or wherever you go, you will see most people with their eyes into their phone, ipad, computers or another device.

There is a lot of people doing a lot of activities everyday and some others doing nothing than just watch TV. Each human person in the world have a purpose , goal to get in a future and is something that we really want to have in our life. Unluckily purposes dont come by itself as a miracle. Every person has a different purpose,some purposes are complicated to reach,and theres also some less complicated but doesnt make any difference because every person decides and picks what are their purposes and whether if they give up or they do anything to reach them. Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle..It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Some persons give up easily, they think is impossible, hard, complicated, but basically what they are doing is waste their capacity to make something and improve themselves, just because someone doesnt trust in our capacity means we have to stop doing what we like and quit . It wont be perfect at the first try , it may not be the same thing that we were expecting, but the effort you put is what it counts. Quit is the easy way to give up , and that is they way to demonstrate weakness the people that didnt trust in us would laugh and spread the rumors of our fail. We wont feel good after that and well feel embarrass of ourselves , we wouldnt be capable of going out with our mind thinking in what other people is thinking . If we fall down we need to stand up again , dropping some tears and being in bed all day wont help , think in what other people might think about us wont do anything than just make us feel even more weak. What we can really do is confront the reality , understand our mistakes try to solve them ,try to get better by the time . No one is perfect we might see people getting their purposes easily and we cant understand how , what we dont know is the reality of how the live by the way we dont need to be comparing our live with others life . A girl from school had extra weight and she didnt played any sports , she was lazy to walk and all her friends were skinny and she felt bad about herself and very ashamed of her body she tried to lose weight but slowly she was quitting ,she was crying a lot and feeling weird and unwanted by everyone , some students started to judge her and no one wanted be her friend and they were bullying her . A lot of girls bother her, and others saw her crying and hurt and they didnt stop them. Among the time the girl started to eat healthier and started to walk everyday she was adding one more lap ,then she started to jug and after run . Her bones and body develop she got skinnier and after she got back to school everyone got impressed .Now she was more confident and it wasnt easy , it took time , tears , sacrifices but she did it . This is a experience that taught me to see different the things , to see how we can do it , if we want , if we put a lot of effort and we are patient to see the changes. After everything well feel great and proud of what weve done. It is hard to try without being scared , without doubt .Believe in our capacities is something that we stopped doing , and say I cant became more common and we hear that everyday. We dont do things we want to do because of our insecurities and our laziness when there is a lot of people dying to have an opportunity. Always is better to try than just watch .Everyone has their daily things to do , some people work , others study , others do both or more things and they dont have time for them. It is necessary to take our time to make this things possible, it is necessary to have clearly our mind and see what are we capable to do and how far we can go .

We are trying we arent being like the rest and that make us unique ans specials, show to whoever said we couldt do it or make it how wrong they were and they judge us before knowing our capacities. Demonstrate the people that was supporting us what we did to make them proud and we know how good we are going to feel that day. We dont need to take care of what others say, they might give us advises but we are the only ones deciding our actions.

Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, it also can find a nice job that you want. What are these things mean? Let me tell you in this essay. First, imagination can make yourself happier. Why? It is because you can imagine something that you like. For example, you want to fly like a bird but you cant do that. You can imagine how that feel. It feels free? Comfortable? Or tired? You can also imagine how you look like when you were 100 years old. Imagination make yourself happy. Second, how can imagination help people? Lets think about if there is a child crying in the mall and everyone look at her because she dress so weird. You can use your imagination at this moment. You may told her to imagine with you. For example,""Dont crying sweetie, think about everyone look at you is because you dress like a princess. Now you are visiting them. You have to be nice and elegant. "" Maybe she will stop crying. Lastly,parents always said "" You cant find a nice job that you want by having your imagination."" I think you can find a job with your imagination. For example, if you want to be a home designer but you dont have imagination. You make the house so horrible. You will got fired and you cant earn money.

707,3835,E069D2A8AE1E,"Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isnt a bad thing. Its also important to learn each others experiences. I think it is important to learn from other peoples experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if theyre in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, lets dig in deeper. First, I think its important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what youre talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that persons attention deeper. Second, its important that you help the person if theyre in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that youre a good person. If you didnt reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay. Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and youre friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. Theyre lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork. In Conclusion, I think it is important to learn from other peoples experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if theyre in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!

For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or persons authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma.

The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year. The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year. Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they dont forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year. In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Dont fix it if it aint broke.""",10,9,10,8,8,8,2806,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 10"
712,3840,FB4D3D883D49,"Cellphones has already taken place of your calendar dont let him take place of your family. Some people think cell phones should be allowed in school but other says it is just destruction. Cell phones shouldnt be allowed in school because it is destruction,increase cheating, and less use of dictionary. Firstly, cell phone is destruction. For example the one person I know was always on her phone. Moreover as her phone vibrate she just open the phone and start checking messages. As result she was not distracting herself but also class and teacher. Later on due to this habit she couldnt pass SOL.Because phone was destruction for her. Last year one of my friend didn,t uses much phone in the first quarter she got really good grade. Furthermore in second quarter she starting using cell phones more. Moreover in school she do all her work in rush so that she could have more time for cell phones. As a result her grade starting getting worst she ended up felling her both SOL.In her first quarter she has six A and one B but in fourth quarter she have five A,one B ,and one D.Furthermore one of person couldnt pass SOL and grades also go really worst. Secondly,cell phones is not only destruction but also increases cheating. For example one of my friend whenever give test she take picture and send question to other student. The teacher make same test for both classes. Furthermore she can help them by giving them answers in test but in SOL she couldnt help them. As a result they will end up might be felling SOL.Moreover one of person was giving a final exam in school she was also texting one of her friend all the answers and the answers she didnt know she was also using Google for them. Most of the question was about vocabulary she was just searching vocabulary and writing on final exam. Cell phones are not only increasing cheating but also student thinks they are helping others which is wrong. The both person was doing wrong one of them was sending question to her friends other was searching from Google. Thirdly,cell phones is destruction,moreover increase cheating furthermore there is less use of dictionary. For example one of my friend prefer searching from phone rather than using dictionary. The main reason for using cellphones instead of dictionary was because from dictionary you have to find a word it take more time than cell phones. Furthermore in cell phones you just have to type a word and cell phones will give you meaning ,and synonyms. Moreover one of my friend always uses phone for searching a word meaning she never use paper dictionary but in SOL they didnt allow you to use phone. As a result she struggle using paper dictionary. People want easy way to do things that is why they uses cell phones instead of using dictionary. In conclusion, some people think cell phones are helpful in education but other thinks it is destruction. Cell phones are not helpful in education because it is destruction for students,increase cheating,and less use of dictionary .Students are keep checking on their phone. Cell phones is also increasing cheating student text test question to each other also can search from Google. Cell phones are also taking away people paper dictionary from student , student really struggle when they go for testing and cell phones are not allowed. Cell phones are like drugs to youth they are getting addictive to it. ",7,6,5,5,4,5,3802,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
713,3841,26E2AD762E9B,"Duke Ellington said that, "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"". I do agree on what Duke Ellington said. My reasons for this quote are because of You can show what you can do, You can learn what you need to know, and You can help other people show what they can do. First, In any problem l can beat it there is nothing in my way to stop me from getting to goal. For example l had to pass a test in order to pass the class. l took my time l read the question over and over again. When l felt that my eyes whore going to fall out l kept going. I told that test who was the boss. I showed it what l knew. In addition l was on the football team l had to know the plays. In order to start in the next game l had to show everyone and the couches l knew the plays. Later in the day it was time for me to face my problem. After 23 catches l showed my team mates and couch l knew the plays. In other words try your best at everything. Secondly, l dont know everything in the world. For example I had a good friend named Generic_Name had a girlfriend named Generic_Name they both had a great and good times together. One day Generic_Name wanted to go ice skating. One thing she didnt know Generic_Name hatted skating. When Generic_Name was little he loved skating, but one day he fell trying to do a 360 spin and he broke his leg ever sense that moment in Generic_Name life has not been the same. Generic_Name said the pain felt like 100 gun shot to the leg. The doctor told Generic_Name to take 3 pills a day to make him fell better. The doctor also said 20% of people break there leg a year you will be fine. Year passed by to the present Generic_Name was talking to Generic_Name its time to go ice skating Generic_Name didnt want Generic_Name knowing what happened. Generic_Name told him self lets go. As soon as he got on the ice he fell Generic_Name started to laugh the she said you got some learning to do. Generic_Name said l guess your right. Lastly, l could and will always help someone beat their problem and try there best. For example l needed help on this paper for science l didnt know a single thing. My Brother Generic_Name knew a lot about science me and Generic_Name didnt really help each other a lot , but for some reason he helped me finish the paper. l asked him why did he help me he said you looked like you needed help. l wanted to see you do good in life and face your problems and beat them, But sometimes you need some help from other people. In addition Generic_Name wanted me to get a good grade on that paper he told me that your never alone. In other words there is nothing wrong with getting help on anything. In other words, A problem is a chance for you to do your best wise words from Duke Ellington. I agree 1,000% on what he said everything you do should be at your 100%. You can show what you know, You can learn what you need to know to get better, and You can help others show what they can do to face their problems and beat them. The last thing l will tell you is stop taking the easy way and take the hard way to see if you can do it.",6,5,6,5,6,7,513,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I believe that high schools should never let students choose specific courses because, some of students dont even have in mind what theyre trying to do after high school, another reason is that theyre way too young to choose something that is going to affect your whole life, my last reason is that students may change their mind and choose another course and the school is not going to let them choose another course. High school students change their mind all the time we may want to be a doctor today and tomorrow we want to be a barber or wanna go to the army, for example my best friend go to a school like that you have to choose some specific courses so when you get graduate you dont be confused about what you going do in college and he told me that hes trying go to a different school because that school doesnt let him change his courses because he was trying be a firefighter but now he change his mind and want to a doctor. We high school students are way to young to choose some specific courses for our careers I believe they should make a conference and discuss all that with our parents. My final reason is because students not really sure about what are we trying do in my opinion they should let us do that on the students senior year because, on their senior year students have a clear mind set of what they going to do after students graduate, like my other friend that go to Generic_School now hes a senior and hes going to be doctor so the school just want him to take the nurse and biology class. In conclusion, I believe that school should never let students choose their classes or courses, even though it would be nice if you want to be a doctor for example the school should force you to take doctors relate classes so you can get use to do things that doctors does.",8,8,7,7,6,6,1540,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
716,3844,F610B3CBF3DF,"Winston Churchill once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", Meaning success can only be achieved by having few mistakes along the way. Many believe achieving success means doing everything perfect and not making one single mistake, having a couple of mistakes doesnt mean failure it means progress to be successful because one can learn from the mistakes that are made and helps improve to achieve something better. To be successful, there will be some mistakes in the journey but when those mistakes are made learning from them is the best way to accomplish your goal. For example, when one is constructing a house but have little knowledge on construction, the one building the house will mess up and fail at times but the best way to finish something is to learn from what went wrong. To clarify, to accomplish a certain goal, learning from the mistakes along the journey is the best way to do it. Not only learning from mistakes help be successful but it also helps improve one another. Improvement is a big key in success. Failure will always have a role in success but it happens to help improve to become or do something better. For example, famous altheles in sports make mistakes in games all the time, but from the failures in the past, pro altheles train to improve more to become better and to not make the same mistakes again. In other words, failure may be the worse but its a way to show what to improve. From mistakes made in the past one will become better or do better than expected. Having a couple of mistakes doesnt mean failure it means progress to be successful. Failure will play an important role during the journey of success but you learn from mistakes and improve to be better, success isnt perfect, the little mistakes along the way are actually the things that make one get to the top and become successful.",8,7,8,8,8,9,3669,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I think more people should start being kind to other. tell me this when someone is kind to you. you feel happy right knowing that someone cared to do that thing for you when your being kind to other they feel the same feeling as you do knowing that someone cares about you. and when people show kindness it usually comes back to them in any forms like a person give you a bag of chip because that person was feeling kind. that all my reason that people should that being kind to others. how kindness can help you is when your car turns off when your in the road people will come and try to help you thats kindness they were kind to come and help you. when your stuck on the homework you ask your friends for help there being kind enough to help you. volunteer help people if something happened to their homes volunteer help people for no pay they are being kind. this is all my reason kindness is never wasted and how it can come back to and how it effect people and how it helps them and why you should do it.

719,3847,2E3FC44757FB,"Do you ever help somebody out and good things come out of it? or helped out a young person and they see you as a role model? well guess what! There this program called ""Older students assist younger students"" . What I think on this program that pairs older students with younger students is important because the students that are older already learned about what the younger students are learning about so they give out ways on how they learned it and show it to the younger students . Another reason why this program that older students assist younger students is good and important because a older student can also get more information from what a younger student already knows and not a older student. This program is not only good and important but it also helps out any age ,in other words this program can help anybody out when help is needed. You can help out anybody and they will see you as there role model for showing them the good things you should do and what comes out of it from the good descion you did. Having a negative mind wont get you nowhere in live so that is why older students help around younger students because the younger students are young and still dont know what they plan on being in the future. Not everybody has a role model because they have there own plans in the future or because they just dont want to do what everybody does as a living but when they get some help from a older person who already knows what they are doing the younger students start to wake up notice that you got to do what you got to do in order for you to get where you want to be. The only thing is that only some schools have this program and it sucks becuase there is some people who want help or need assist from someone who has already been what there going thru so if you have this program use it wisley and dont take it for granted. everybody in the world can get the help they need so they can be someone in life so that is why they have that program were older students help out younger students so the younger students wont make error mistakes in there future life.

Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids dont have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie. Eating healthy is very important, because you wont have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it wont make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives. KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes.

724,3852,38452CB371C9,"Generic_Name Generic_Name 3rd period 11/08/2018 Former British prime minister Winston Churchill once said success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. you learn from your mistakes every time you fail in your live. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives. failing does not always mean it is the end of the world you have chances in life to keep trying hard . everyone has always an experience of failure in life nobody every succeeded without failing in their lives. First when you fail sometimes you get disappointed and say am never going to succeed in life but when you see the mistake you did the first time you try hard until you pass it. for example last year i failed my world history exam i was so disappointed that i did not want to retake again but our teacher gave me the paper back to see what i did wrong i saw that i did not read the question. from that day on i began reading my questions and i got the highest grade in class. i learned i should always read my questions before answering because if i do not read i will fail again and i did not want to retake the test again, when i read the question and i finally began to understand the question. i learned that i should always read my questions even if am in a hurry to go and it does not matter the situation reading a question is important. i learned that guessing is not good sometimes it results in failing, i should study the night before a test. Second a person should always learn how to study hard on everything you are given even if it is hard just try your best. last year when i gave my mum my world history final exam results she told me that i should try hard and she knows i can pass the test i told her that i will but am scared to take it again. my mum made sure that i studies every day and one day when i stayed after school for extra help. i also achieved passing this world history by trying my best to understand what the question is asking . paying attention in class also made me pass not only the final exam but also the class. when i passed this exam i was so excited because i studied hard to get at least a eighty nine on the final exam and i was also passing the class and i was understanding my work i was also on top of my assignments. Third failing something you took for the first time is not a bad thing it tell you that you need to keep working hard. for example one day i came back home crying and my mum asked what was wrong and i told her am still failing the world history exam. she told me that failing does not make me dumb it simply tells me that i need to correct my mistakes. she also told me that as a kid she also was failing her classes but she tried hard and hard and she now is very successful at wok. i also asked her how can i be successful? she told me that keep trying your best even if it is not your best accomplishment. she also told me that she would always be proud of me because she sees me working hard and trying to do my best. when i finally studied a lot and re-took the same test and passed it i was very proud of myself and said failure always leads to success. however, some people may say that failure does not play a big role in your life because there are other ways to suceed. you will always suceed anything in life withour failing, you do not need to work hard for what you want and you can always achieve everything as long as you do it. but they are wrong because failure is always the number one thing that leads people to sucess. failing leads you to try hard in life you learn from your mistakes. when you fail it does not mean it is the end of the world. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives.",6,6,6,5,6,5,730,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Getting a job would help save you a lot of money for college. Having a year off doesnt exactly mean that you have to go to school, but instead getting a job will be very beneficial. Whether its to support your family, save money for school, or even for pocket money, knowing that you have not only time, but also extra money, will help you realize that there isnt much to stress about. Jobs also dont have to be something that is outside of school. Having a job that is academic wise or just something temporary to have the experience, will help open you up to more opportunities. Whether you are looking forward to go to college or to become more appealing to bigger organizations/ companies in your work force, having a job that is academic base will help. For example, going to coach my brothers soccer game during the weekends compared to going to a community center to fix computers during the weekends, wouldnt really open me up to more work opportunities rather than fixing computers at a community center will. Going to college isnt for everyone, but for many is the way to go. Maybe your going for your Masters or even a PHD, when you have a year you are saving the amount of extra time that you would be spending in school. Lets say for my PHD I would have to stay in school for 8 years, knowing that I have saved my self a year even though it doesnt seem like much compared to 8 years is not only saving time and money, but also saving a year to your age. Most student that go for the traditional 4 years typically are being rushed and become stressed out by the end. Colleges will also see that you have graduated showing them your were willing to work hard to get that extra year. Being able to graduate in 3 years doesnt only ask for patients but also for your dedication. Although you are graduating a year early, it doesnt neccisarly mean that the work load given in that year doesnt have to concern you. You would have to be able to manage your time and work hard to makeup for that year, yes, even if it means you have to give your summer break. Staying organized and knowing what your aim is, will give you more confidence making you become dedicated. Although some may argue that this is definitely something stressful and given 3 years is not enough for the workload in high-school, just know there is still hope. There are some student that dont have enough time to even finish in 4 years. So being thankful, you should know that it is alright if you cant finish in 3 years. Having this program gives opportunities to student but also saves time. School districts should label the students that have enough credits to graduate and for those that dont, and for those that dont, they should offer support (programs/ clubs) for them to possibly graduate in 3 years. If its not possible for students to graduate in 3 years then the 4th year should just be a less stressful year.",6,7,8,8,8,7,461,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
726,3854,38FA6185D43F,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and I agree with what former said because to succeed in something you have to accomplish many steps to get there. Feeling motivated helps you succeed and accomplish your goal. Its better to keep failing at something over and over again because you can see what you need improvements on but eventually youre going to succeed. For an example, my sophomore year I was taking geometry and I didnt do very well during the school year but there was a point where I just didnt even care anymore. I failed all four quarters for that class during the year and I dont blame anyone but myself because I know I was capable of passing and succeeding the class. The reason why I didnt pass the class was because I didnt feel motivated and I just gave up too quickly just by a few fails I made. I kept failing constantly so I didnt even try anymore but If i wouldve followed from what Former said, I know I wouldve succeeded during the year. However, I took the class again that same year during summer school and I knew I had to pass and give it my all. From all the fails and mistakes I made, I learned from them. I kept practicing and I kept motivating myself, there wasnt a moment when I doubted myself. By the end of summer school I passed the class and all I had to pass was my SOL and I know I had to work hard to pass the SOL so I kept studying. The same day I took the test, I was going to receive my score and I took my time on it but eventually, my teacher told me I passed and I ended up getting the highest score from the class. I was proud of myself even though I failed many time I eventually succeeded. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and from my experience thats why I agree with what Former said. The most important thing you cant do it do is give up because If i wouldve gave up I wouldve never succeeded. Its worth it to fail over and over again but without loss of enthusiasm and eventually succeeding.",7,7,7,7,7,8,740,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
727,3855,E12450BAE343,"Would it be surprising to know that kids learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by student getting to much school work that cannot all be handied in on night. Every day kids complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing children to work on their own schedule helps them become more motivated to work. Students being educated at school gaing more freedom to create their own schedule and their own rules. Learning at home and not at schools helps kids succeeed and have better grades. One of the best thing about homeschooling is that it can be done at anytime, and anywhere. Children have a flexible time schedule which means that the parents can help. The students can work around the parents schedule instead of the parents working around the students schedule. Some students have a trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pase set by teachers. Homeschooling allows students to work at their own pace and on their own schedule. Another thing about homerschooling is that there are no misguided rules about technology or how to dress. This is good because instead of worrying about the rules. The students can focus on their studies. When you are taking a test or taking notes at a public school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home would benefit students. Learning from home wont have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students wont lose focus on the work they are doing and get better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in an environment their are not familiar with, which makes the feel uncomfortable. If a students learns from home they will feel more relaxed and confortable and wont stress about work. In a school, you are struck at desk for 6 hours and have a limited time to eat and limited bathroom breaks. This is not help a students learning at all. On the other hand. If you are at home you can eat and do whatever you want when you want. There are still a few reasons not to do distanced learning. There are many more opportunities with public schools. People from different colleges dont go to studentshomes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public school are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school funding for public schooling willl fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of buged cuts. In public schools, depending an the teachers, cheating is hard to do. My conclusion is students should be offered classes online or at home because the environment is less distracting, which could be less stressful. At home there are less distractions, rather than at school where there are many different thing to students, can greatly affect the quality of a students work.",7,7,8,7,7,6,3218,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
728,3856,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms. First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we cant stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes. Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We cant just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance. In conclution I must said that I agree with Endersons quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty. So we can leave a better future for our childrens.

729,3857,80C2ED8BE6A6,"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of students struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff youre interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home. I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so its more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When students get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if youre sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop youll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades. However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eyes. Also that its easier to cheat on tests and quizs in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosent know what your doing on. That is my reasoning on why taking online classes is more beneficial then going to school. ",6,6,7,8,7,7,1693,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
730,3858,7797541CF0A6,"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it wont help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life. We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because its not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesnt matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess. Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because its not easy to learn english. Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesnt have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesnt matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didnt give up because of that. People have to know that doesnt matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesnt mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

731,3859,62EA3F855DB2,"It is a better choice asking more than one person because when you ask them whats your problem or question most of them are going to say something else while some are just going to say the same thing. But its not a good idea just asking your problem or question to one person. Because that person might be wrong and not know ask your examples:mom,dad,ant,uncle your friends anyone you trust and thats how you get multiple opinions and when your making a better choice by asking anyone you know. But dont ask one person cause one that person might not know and two its not a better choice by asking only one person and sometimes you might not trust that one person by his or its idea.

732,3860,A98482015F5A,"There are many instances where people have the mindset that you must be doing something constantly in order to achieve the most. I believe that having this mindset is terrible and is not beneficial to the person. I believe this because if you take the time to rest you will find that it allows you to regain a creative mindset, it allows your work to regain its quality, and taking time to rest serves many health benefits. Regaining a positive, creative mindset serves many purposes. Having a creative mindset will allow you to think freely, and come up with brilliant, unique ideas that give you an advantage over possible competition. For example, if you are constantly writing all the time you are not giving yourself time to create unique ideas that separate you from the rest of the competition. Another example we can use for this scenario is when an entrepreneur is constantly trying to start a business without taking a step back and allowing themselves to come up with a unique idea that they have passion for. Where as if someone who does take breaks is working in the same field as another individual they are working less, but achieving more because their ideas are more unique and thought through. When you are constantly working there is a high chance that your work may lose its quality. When an individual is working the factor that they must think about most is the quality of the work they are providing. If the quality of the work is not there then it completely takes away from the rest of the qualities from that body of work. For example, if a man wants to sell a product, and he puts hours upon hours into this item but there is no quality then the item will not sell. Where as if the man takes constant breaks focusing on quality, and not quantity then the item will have a lot more attraction from people. Being idle sometimes rather then working persistently also has its benefits. When working diligently all the time there may be times where you may be very stressed out or youve tired your body out, but these problems can be avoided. These problems can be avoided by taking breaks, taking breaks allows your mind to relax and release stress that has been piled over a certain amount of time. For example, if you are a athlete and you are constantly over working yourself there is a high chance you may get injured, but if you balance yourself and take breaks you are allowing your muscles to heal themselves which also boosts your performance for the next practice or game. Allowing yourself to take breaks also improves the quality of the work you provide whether its paperwork or sports. Although some people think never being idle is a good thing because you can achieve more work with no set backs. I still think that being idle serves a purpose because you want to be able to incorporate quality into your work, you also want to be creative when it comes to providing, and lastly you want to be able to gain the benefits from relaxing your body and your mind. Finally, if you are one of the individuals who like to work diligently without breaks, you should at least consider taking a break once because it will not hurt you, and if anything it will help you.",9,8,9,9,9,8,2265,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
733,3861,19DDF17CA4DC,"When you see people doing their work do you sometimes think they are feeling alone doing their work. I mean the teacher ask them if they want to work with a group or do it alone but they always chose to do it alone because they dont know anyone in the class or they dont feel like working with anyone that means they wanted to look cool about it. so that would mean more work for them, What i feel that is more beneficial is working in a group. When working in a group you have less work to do because everyone has a different job to do for example, lets say you have a project and it is a group project everyone has a job to do like one person could be doing research, another person can be working on the poster/PowerPoint,and the last person can be the one presenting it to the class. people could say that working alone is better and much quite, However working in a group means to making new friend and getting the work done much faster. Working in a group isnt really that bad you can have some fun when you are working in a group like making new friend asking when they can stay after so you can do the project together or going to each others houses planning on what you should do with your project. But it is really fun when you are working with your friends,Working with your friends is fun because you would be laughing all day and you might or might not get some work done but that just depends on the kind of friend group you have. There are some who would be focus and get the work done but there are others who would be laughing and get nothing done. people could say that working with friends is distracting, However having to work with your friends would be really easy and fun. Its much easier for the students to work in group the can get together and work things out with each other instead of them doing it alone and they dont have anything planed like no ideas at a lot then its good to have a group because they can bring new ideas. New plans like everyone can have their ideas on their project plus it would be nice seeing what the student made see what each student has. It just shows that everyone had different themes of there project. so when you work alone you just only see one persons ideas and that fine but when you are in a group you see everybody ideas. Other might people say that one mind is good enough, However many minds would make a differences. The reason people work by their self is because they might think that working in group is too distracting and its not fun when people keep on talking. But working with other people will help make things faster and fun but also you get to give your own opinion about things and you get to work together plus you get to learn a lot from your group.

First, ""the first impression the you receive is very important"" Well im not sure of that but is something that other poeple say, so we can think that for one moment maybe is true; because for some people is important the what other people think about them so put this case and the table and start think why base on my experience i""m not going to say that is true but i can give you one reason that i think. Well is depent the who is the person because if is a boy who you like you wanna receive a good impression but if is not pass the time you or him can change the impression because now you alredy know the person the boy the point is the time why? because the first impression is a second but also you can change pass on time. Second, the impression is how you look like or the expression on your face good we find another point because is other impression the we can change and you gonna think how well this is a situation before one year ago i was talk with a person and she look in the first mad, but she wasnt mad the face of her was express mad but she wanst pas the time more and more my so my first impression was the she was mad now i think the oppossed of her The time is the words more important in the life that we can stop or pass and also we can forget because his live in our life but the impression is something the we can forget the we can pass and something the cant lived in us because is something that we can change is something that we can move. In conclusion everything is based on time and if you ask me that if is a possible change the first impression im gonna say yes because you never going to forgot the first impression the you receive from other person but you can also change later and your mind or in your background. Always we can change something thanks for everything.",6,6,7,6,5,5,703,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
740,3868,CBFD5CD8BCD9,"Yes, I believe curfew can keep citizens out of trouble by limiting how long they can stay out of their homes. It can improve the city in the process of making the citizens feel safe. City council should adopt a curfew for teens. Curfew keep teenager from staying out for too long and helps them catch a midnight rest. It balances the world and helps teens managing the time they work in between their jobs and regular daily activities like a midnight jog. Curfews helps them plan to head home early because we dont know what may happen during the night. I love to have a limit on my time because I may lose track of time and be out for longer than I need to be. Adding a curfew the city is a good choice keeping the citizens safe while improving the public law for less of a death potential. It wont go well if we dont get a curfew and I will explain why. If we dont get a curfew things will be problematic. Everyone will be staying up late making noise and traffic comes as often while people will just do crazy things. Its important that the city needs a curfew so it keeps the citizens in check and makes sure that no one is up late who might be doing some illegal activities. Staying up all night is bad cause it doesnt help the brain function for u to gain strength for tomorrow. It makes you fatigued and dysfunctional as well as can make you miss important events in life as u go on restless. It is sad to see the amount of car crashes when people drive even though they didnt get enough sleep compared to drunk driving is another story. You can set a curfew for yourself to be safer and more energized for the next day because the early bird gets the worm. Having a curfew isnt a bad thing. Its an mandatory rule that will helps u live longer, be healthy and keeps u awake for the next day. The earlier you go to bed the more awake youll feel in the morning since u set a curfew for yourself. I personally set one for myself so I could can be ready to take a test and do my assignments as Im up and at em. The council is a genius for coming up with the idea of a curfew and I am proud to accept and support the idea.",5,7,7,7,8,6,2788,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

742,3870,E926BE6F104E,"Working in a group can be helpful. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time. Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince Id rather work alone. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldnt have been blamed for. So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. But thats a whole different story. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.",7,8,7,8,8,8,3389,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

From the process it takes to graduate a year before it would seem that yes, they are attending school for less time but from the courses in summer or evening theyre putting the same if not little change in time of the average high school student in just that one year. If they can handle the equivelent of junior and senior year in the same year then it shows how hard working and out going they are and could benefit them when they`re choosing a collage because: it could impress the collages theyd want to attend they already know the stress of a collage class because of the extra courses they could be in a better position with organization, and being on time It would also be a great benefit for students whod join the work force instead of collage because: they also know the stress from the extra courses if their family is going through financial problems it gives them more time to work theyd have a head start on their life The only real problem of this would be the amount of time and stress the student had but thats only limited for the school year. in conclusion i believe school districts should give students the chance to graduate early if they are willing to put the time and effort of two years into one and face the obstacles that come with it. itd be very beneficial to the student and/or their family and create a great layout for them fro what ever comes next.",6,7,6,7,7,7,1647,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

First, students shouldnt use cell phone in classroom because, they are trouble in the class room. That mean when the teacher is teaching the students may be listing music so that makes trouble the other students, They didnt do any thing for classwork. They only doing listing music and watch a movie so on that happen its very disturb. Also, If the student want listen music and teacher never want to listen music so that make fight with teacher.

Their is no attenition to learn. Their is only play with their friends in the class .Their is show a bad image with their friends. It mean one student want to joke for other student girls or boys so he gonna show for that person bad and rude picture then student lough in bad situation.

746,3874,2B69ADAD868C,"""some people may say that growth does not depend on doing something beyond what they have, for it is not unnecessary. However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress. Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of. If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things. Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered. Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said, nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination. Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life.

It will change your impression by how you get more skills like how to knowing yourself by finding jobs where you comfortable with. so that way when people wants to know you by personality they will know that first impression it has impossible to change because you have made yourself to make it and think that you can do it like other people do, then you will realize that you made a good experience. Not everyone has a same first impression because they had different personality and idea for their self, some of them is not changing of their impression the reason why is they do not trying them self what they believe that everyone has knowledge even if they can.

748,3876,583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isnt a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up. People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early youd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because theyre studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments. I think its better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if youre apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time. Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits. In conclusion i think its best if people dont graduate early because theyd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe its better and easier to graduate after the four years.

750,3878,5132328226C2,"Afterschool Homework Club Most students do not enjoy doing their homework at home; for it can get quite frustrating. A lot of students favorite part of their school day is going home, but some other students favorite part of the day is their afterschool club. Now teachers and students are volunteering to meet with people who have difficulty in subjects or who want to finish their homework early,but afterschool. I think it is great that people are staying afterschool to help other people with school work and learning. It is a good to be a part of an afterschool homework club because it makes teachers do what theyre best at, it helps students understand certain things better, and a club made for troubled kids makes other kids not afraid to ask for help when they dont understand something. A teachers main job is to teach their students common knowledge that they will need when they become independent adults. Although the main job for teachers is teaching, they can, and should, also inspire their students. With this afterschool club students will be inspired to help others when they see their own teachers helping others to better understand something. Feeling believed in is an amazing feeling that students will feel in the club. The teachers who are helping the students arent getting paid to be their, they are volunteering to help the students because they believe that the student can learn and understand something better, with their help. The people who volunteer to help their students would also be helping their community. The smarter that the teachers make their students the brighter the future were headed towards. Not only can the afterschool homework club help teachers do their job, but it can also give students the extra help that they need to understand a subject. Learning and understanding something new is something a lot of people struggle with. Some people struggle with learning something new because the class period that they learned it in was too short. A lot of times when learning something new it is important to have time to understand it, and one class period is not long enough. The club would give students extra time to understand the subject, and possibly do the homework that the subject required. Doing homework at home can be stressful at times. A lot of times a home is loud and distracting, but with a one-on-one class with a teacher it would be quite and not distracting. There are different ways that a person learns best. Some people are visual learners and some are verbal learners. Some students dont understand what theyre being taught because of the way its being taught. A visual learner could be learning verbally, and it might just be very confusing because of it being taught verbally. The club would have teachers teaching in the students proffered way. Because of students getting extra help, more students are becoming unafraid to ask for help when they have trouble understanding something. This club makes students know that they arent the only ones that have trouble in school. A lot of people feel dumb because they cant do something properly or even understand it, but with the club they would see that they arent the only ones struggling to understand the subject. If a person that you knew was getting help from a teacher afterschool and the next day they completely understood the subject, wouldnt you want to go be a part of the club too? Most people think of afterschool clubs as a fun and relaxing activity to calm down their mind from their stressful day at school. Afterschool activities are like school, but its fun, and it is exciting. Learning can be made fun in afterschool clubs because they have students all sharing their struggles and getting help for them. The afterschool homework club would be a safe place for all the people who are afraid to ask for help, but arent afraid to be a part of a group. The club makes people feel welcome, not alone, and so much more. The afterschool homework club benefits all the people in the community. It benefits the students by giving them the help they need to succeed. It benefits the teachers by giving them a chance to inspire others to help each other. The afterschool homework club benefits the students parents because it prevents the students from coming home to complain about their homework that they dont understand. The afterschool homework club is the best thing a school could do for their community.",10,10,10,10,9,9,1061,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who dont agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things. We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience. On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things dont give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard. There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday wont give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But thats not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. lets just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didnt knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didnt even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today im really good at playing guitar. There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and dont try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. Im not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it. In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you. ",7,6,6,5,6,6,437,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Some people think that spending more time at school would be a good idea because students would have more time to study. Others think that An 8 hours of school time is enough time to study every day. This is an controversial issue and school time should not be too much .This change would affect students and teachers because some students have part time jobs,students would not have enough time to do their daily activities with friends and family,teachers and students would be tired by the the end of the day and they would not do good. Some students have part time jobs and they take some rest before going to work after school. Some students go to work right away after every school to get out early and do their homework after. By adding two hours a to the school schedule would make students who have job work till late. Even though some students need to work as much time as they can to help their families or pay something they are trying to buy. Some of this students would be also constantly tired of spending too much time at school and then going to work. Another reason why school days should only be eight hours long and not ten is because students would not have enough time to do their daily activities. Students hang out with family and friends. Some students are part of a sport team and they have to have time to go practice. Even some students help their family to either clean or any other thing that has to be done at home. Some students have to take care of their little siblings after school because their parent have to go shopping or work. Students also need to do what they like and by doing that they would be more active. Another reason is that teachers and students would be tired by the the end of a ten hours school day and they would not do good. Some students are already tired in the 4th hour of school. Some students do not want to do their work in the last class and some fall sleep even in a eight hours school day. Even teachers would get tired of being teaching and grading papers all day long. When it comes to a history teacher they have to talk a lot in every class and they get tired. By making every school day 10 hours long would put to much pressure to students and teachers that they would be exhausted by the end of the day that they would not be able to pay attention in their work. School itself it hard sometimes but working and studding is even worst and those who work and study at the same time often need time time to get things done, and by spending too much time in just one thing can affect the other .Every one has personal things and activities to do and some require certain among of time.

754,3882,16C794A0F479,"students should not be allow to use their cellphone during class time only if it is necessary or with the teacher permission. One of the most important reason why you should not be allow to use your phone during class is because the cellphone really distract you, it may be because youre playing, text ting or listening music. Cellphone can be a big distraction for the student for to many reasons, sometimes students do not really think like that, but on my opinion it is a big distraction, using the cellphone during class can make you miss important parts from the class that you may need for a future test that maybe one of the answer can be that small part that you didnt hear because you were on your phone, but the teacher is not the responsible from your actions, you take your own decisions,and you choose the decision to look at your phone than pay attention at class. in other parts teachers should make that their rules for the classroom has appraisal, and make the students respect them, or if the teacher cant do that at least the school can make that rule. Some times youre just pretending that you are paying attention, but youre not really paying attention for the reason that you may be at your phone or answering a text, i am saying this because it happened to me and i do the same, i know some students has the same situation and others that cant live without their cellphone. it can be addictive. some times I think it can because the age, we are just young persons and some persons think different they really come to study but others just come because they have to. The effects of being using the cellphone at class are that you not really pay attention at class and you fail the class. cellphones are not necessary at class and its not educational or helpful for you to remained or learn things. On my person i fail classes because the same situation, i fail classes and if i fail classes ill fail the school year and then wont would like to repeat other school year. That gonna make me think about that and i dont would like to come to school because i feel like i loose my time coming to school to repeat it every single day. i think cellphone make you stupid and act like a dumb because when youre on your phone, you are like in other world, you dont pay attention on what is happening around you. you are loosing time from your life time that you can use study or do others necessary and important things for your life. i see students that they just dgf and they on their phone during class, im one of them, lol. On my opinion, cellphone can be necessary some times, but i dont really need it during class because i come to study, take notes and do my best in class for have good grades, i will say that cellphone can be use only during test, classwork because i am that kind of person that likes to be listening relax songs and doing my job. in other way schools gives you a laptop and i think the only thing where you can do all of those things is the computer, i can use Google or YouTube, its not necessary to have your phone on your hands. How can we solve this issue? teachers should collect all cellphones before start class, and make a rule that something gonna happen if he/she see someone with their phone, so students may have to respect this rule. All this conversation i think the problem is not cellphone, i think the problem is technology because humans are depending from technology and and it makes them fool, todays technology can be more smart than a person. if you really read to this side you should understand how is life now, you may be older and smarter than i am, but we both lived different generations, it is all my decisions, we have to control technology not technology has to control us. legalize ;)",6,6,6,6,6,5,313,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
755,3883,41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime. The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What Im trying to say is that i wouldnt have accomplish that if i wouldnt have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that dont do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better. Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it. Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent . Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that arent doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature. For knowing that they are doing thinks that are smart.",7,6,8,7,6,7,857,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
756,3884,7B38A110CC94,"My grandmother used to say ""Your goals are not going to be done if you dont even move a finger"". I am totally agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote about how wonderful is how much we might done if we are always doing something. We can make plans for every goal in life, but it doesnt matter if we just have a plan because we have to work in that plan to get that goal done, we accomplish a lot things more when we are doing something, when we have that determination to get things done to feel proud of ourselves. First of all we have to feel, we need purpose and strength to accomplish every goal in our life to feel proud in a future. For example, when I was little, my biggest dream was to be with my parents one more time as a family, we were separated at that time; I was in my home country, El Salvador and they here in the United States. I had that dream, but yes, it was just a dream. why? Because I was afraid of the journey to be with them again, they used to tell me ""If you dont do anything you will never know how different your life could be here with us, so throw that fear away and lets do something"". Then in my head I said ""if I dont get that courage to make the journey I will never going to see my parents again"" because I knew that they cant go back to my country, at the end I made that decision and I made it, I am with my parents again and as a gift I learned a new language, now I know ill be more helpful for this country because I am bilingual now. Furthermore, we can see in every aspect of life how persons that one day were a common citizen, now are really important in the society because they were always doing something, they were working on their goals. On the other hand we have as example my home country, El Salvadors new president,Nayib Bukele. He was just a citizen like others but he was tired, tired of the political corruption that my country was going through, so here is what he did; he made his plan, he worked on his plan, he worked and made things for the country. Then he became a mayor because people chooses him as their mayor because of all his honest job, he started running for president in 2015, he had a hard time trying to find a political party that supports him with his new ideas and purposes for the country but the parties rejected him because they said he was to young,also they knew he was honest and that he will not admit any corrupt job that affect the country, and they were always looking for reasons to reject him, but he did not give up. Finally he made his own political party and he get the support of all the people that get tired of live in niggardliness during the governance of other parties, he fought against the two most powerful parties in our country, as a result he won the elections in 2019 and he became the new president of the nation. Many people think that it doesnt matters if you have goals and make plans for your future if you dont have some resources as money or a good social status, they can also see life as a random game which means that if you accomplish something they will say that is just luck, however; what they call luck, other people call it, late nights of doing something for what you want for your life. In other words if you want your life to be successful, you dont have to spend your time just dreaming about what you want, because things may be done only if you are always doing something which means; work for what you want, stop thinking about your life goals and start working on them, determine yourself never to be an idler.",8,6,7,6,5,7,1623,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
757,3885,D81AEDF6E262,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, they can do shopping from online, and play games without speaking to another person. However the technology had positive and negative effects on peoples lives. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation, actually many people believe that technology can change the attitude of the people and technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation. Imaging that a family lives faraway from us and need help and nobody lives around this family. Further, in this situation is very necessary the technology because they can be in a very hard situation. For example, when I was in my country many families were living faraway from the city, and some of them did not have any device to communicate with their families or another person; however, some of them were having a really hard lives because sometimes they got sick and they did not have the help from others and they died because the technology was necessary by the moment. In addition, many people believe that technology is bad because technology can change the attitude of the people. In 1978 people were more respectful and some of them did not study but they show the respect to each other. However, people keeps saying that a person change the attitude because of: movies, music, novels, and cartoons. It is true the some people the use technology constantly they can get mental problems or they get blind using technology over and over. For example, I know this families that have a girl that is fifteen years old, and she likes to see many TV shows. This young girl acts like she is more older than other teenagers because she does not obey to her parents. Her conduct is very bad, but that is the way her parents are growing her. This girl goes out whatever she wants and with whatever she wants. Sometimes I think that is her parents fault because they still keep buying many technology things. They do not paid attention to how their daughter is using the technology. By contrast, allowing children using technology at young age is very bad because some of then do not use it appropriate, and when they get older their parents can not control them because they learn many bad things from the technology. Otherwise parents can go out with them instated of using technology. Also, many people believe that technology is bad because technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. It is true that many people are more focus on a screen almost all the time. The Psychologist Generic_Name said that ""it is better have conversations face to face because people can be more clearly about situations"", and he is right because using technology people can lie behind the screen. By this time factories create more devices that makes more people loose their mind in technology. Moreover, about ninety percent of all the people paid more attention to the technology than their families, or people around them. There is one example about lying while using technology, about five months ago I was reading this book that is call "" Behind the Wed "" and was very interested because the character was a woman teacher that was having communication with someone that she did not know nothing about it; however, when they were sending messages the person the was behind was acting the was a man but was a girl acting like a man. When this teacher ask her about if they can do a video call she said not because she was lying to her. There are more examples the happens and real life to many people. In conclusion, technology can be good or bad, but thats depends on the manner of how the people wants to use it. Technology does not stop increasing, yet people have to know how to use it in the appropriate moment and the correct form. Technology can change the life of many people.

758,3886,F98FEC21D9EA,"Should School Extend Two More Hours To The Normal Schedule? One topic that is frequently debated is whether school should extend the day schedule or keep a normal schedule as they have it already. Some people think that school should not expend two more hours to our normal schedule. They feel that if we spend two more hours at school, it will be boring and tired. In my opinion, school should extend two more hours to our schedule for many reasons: I can spend more time to learn in classes, spend more time with friends, and work one more day during the week. Once, I was pretty nervous about my Earth Science SOL test, I did not know what to do to pass it because I never passed any quiz or test that we did during the school year, and I felt worried because I did not understand some topics, and I only had one week to learn everything, so I decided to stay everyday after school to practice with my teacher and by myself at home, after a couple days of practicing I realized that I had learned what I needed to learn and I felt ready to take my SOL and finally, I passed it. Now I know that spending more time in classes helps us to understand what we do not understand yet, learn more about the topics that we are practicing in class, and get ready for any test that we have during the semester. Sadly, I am a Senior, and this is my last year in High School, and that means that maybe, I will not see some friends and teachers again, so I am trying to enjoy everyday in the school expending time with friends and teachers whether during lunch or during classes, and I think that spending at least 25 more minutes with them in every class will help us to know more about each other, and to make more experiences to remember after we graduate from High School. As some students, I do not have a permanent job or an everyday job as some people call it, I work for a moving and storage company, and that means that I can only work Saturdays and sometimes Sundays because I come to school and they ask me to be ready in the company at 7:00 am when I am going to work, but having a free day school during the week would benefit me because I would be able to work one more day during the week, and earn extra money to buy something that I might need. As you have read, I am agree about extend the school day two more hours. Only when we realize that spending more time at school would helps us to learn easier, make a lot of experiences with friends and teachers, and gives us a free day school to work, to do homework, to spend time with family, or do some chores at home, the world will be a better place with students that understand what they need to understand about their classes, and people who takes advantage of at least one day free per week.",8,7,6,7,7,7,3754,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

762,3890,5EFD8FA4133A,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key of success. Some people think that having a positive attitude is not the key to success. That is comprehensible but not all the time. I strongly agree that having a positive attitude can walk you threw success. In my opinion I think having a positive attitude is the key of success because It make you feel confident on what you are doing. First of all, a positive attitude would help you to achieve many things. For example, one time I was taking a Math test, I was not thinking positive, I thought I would failed that test and thats what happened. In addition, I had my chance to retake the test and I went with a positive mind and I did it, I pass my test. Positive attitude also helped me to not get stress because I was positive and I knew I would pass that test. Therefore, a positive attitude can help you in many ways. It make you think that you are going to pass every test even thought you havent studied. Second of all, with positive attitude you can achieve many of your goals. Another example, one time when I was trying to get a job I was thinking in a way that I said to myself that I would not get that job. At that time I said that I can do it, That Im going to get that job because now I have a positive attitude. At that moment when I got that job I felt so happy and my new boss told me that she liked the way that I had a positive attitude and that I was capable for the job. This shows that, a positive attitude can lead you to success. Third of all, some people say that having a positive attitude is not going to guide you to success. They say that even thought you think in a negative way or in a positive way you can still achieve many of your goals. But, when you think in a positive way, It make you feel better and confident on what you are doing, because when you think negatively you can feel depress or sad because you dont believe on your self. Also, It can make you feel that you are not capable to, and you would fail. Furthermore, a positive attitude can guide you and walk you threw success. To conclude, a positive attitude can walk you threw success. You can achieve many things, many goals, etc. It help you to be confident while you are doing something that is hard. It also help you to believe on your self. For me there were many times that I was thinking negatively and I didnt achieve many things but now that I have a positive attitude Im achieving many of my goals and it make me fell proud of me. Thats why we all have to have a positive attitude. ",7,7,6,5,5,5,1224,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Technology was not as big as it is today, but for some reason I have always shown interest in the products that your company has made. When you created the windows PC it revolutionized the world of technology, and ever since then I have been taking technology classes, programming classes, and even engineering classes so that one day I can created something of my own or even be a part of something surrounding your companies work. It would mean a lot if you gave me the chance to come visit your company and learn about the things your company does such as, what type of work your employees do throughout the week, the environment among and which your employees work in, and how you maintain your servers for your computers across the world I would also like to learn a little bit more of your journey as an entrepreneur in your early days, the sacrifices you had to make and the chances you took to get where you are today. I am the perfect candidate to be picked as an intern for your company because of the fact that i have dedicated my life to technology and even followed your footsteps. I know everything there is to know about computer science, programming, and engineering. Out of all the companies that deal with computers, yours is by far the best. I have researched everything about your company going back to the roots when you were in the garage building your computer and programming them to now being one of the richest men in the world having your employees build them for you. I aspire to become a great man like you and this the perfect opportunity to show you and everyone else what i am capable of. I believe that if you choose me as your intern you will gain an even greater advantage in the world of business and technology, I have a certain set of skills that allow me to learn things quick about human behavior and gain the advantage over competing companies i have studied the nature of consumers and i know exactly what they like to see and hear, having me learn a thing or two from you will give not only me a learning experience but you as well. Giving me the chance to see your company work in person is one of my life goals and it would be an honor to learn how you managed to become not only one of the richest men in the world but also learn what made you decide to take on a challenge such as technology giving that it was one of the hardest things to adapt to in your time. You managed on your own to create something as big as your company with just an idea and some programs. Learning something from you is a once in a lifetime thing that probably never happens to most up and coming entrepreneurs like me. Giving me this chance not only helps me but it helps my family and my community. we live in a small town with not much technology and my dream is to change that I want the people in my town to experience the wonders of technology i want to show them that i learned everything I know from the man who started it all, the man who revolutionized the world. In conclusion, giving me the chance to see the work you have created will spark something new in this world of technology. I have followed your footsteps, i have dedicated my life to technology and engineering. However with this opportunity i will create something of my own for my home town so that all my family members and towns people can experience the joys of technology.

765,3893,C652190DB53F,"Working alone is more beneficial than working with a group. People can work relax and calm without being interrupted, and no one has to ask other people opinion, and also people are shy , they might dont like being surrounded by other people. On the other hand, working with a group can be good, because everyone can share ideas. However working alone is much better. Work is already stressful, and work with people talking and giving opinion about the job is worse. Imagine a work where the whole group is speaking and there is someone stressed, this person wont be able to work relax and think about new ideas, probably when the person get home, it will be more stressed than someone who worked alone and quiet. Being alone make any person relax, and once youre relax no one can stop it, the ideas come to your mind. During doing the work, might suddenly appear a new brilliant idea, and with a group the proposal is check with them and see if everyone agrees, and it spend time, and also might happen that not everyone agreed. Working alone can gain time, because people can use the time theyre asking the group to work more instead of asking someone opinion. Also it creates discussion, more and more people speaking at the same time, disagreements and agreements, wasting time, and making people confused. Then it is better work alone to gain time working instead of asking, everyone does your own work. Being surrounded by a lot of people might be hard for shy people. For example, Im shy, and work in group for me is a struggle, have to talk to other person, have to share my ideas, I cant do my work relax, I cant either think about anything. The impression caused is that people will look at your work and judge it, and wont agree, and there Im, needing to do everything again, in most of the times I dont even show my own work I just agree with other people work. It is not good, the brain doesnt work how it was supposed to work, people looking and may judging, all of it might collaborate for a terrible work. Some people might say that work together people could share ideas and open the door to new opportunities, of course share ideas is a good point, see every point of view. However working alone has much more benefits, is better to have a good time working, without stress than share ideas and get home stressed and full of everything. Working alone in a peaceful place, just you and your thoughts, to think about everything, every point, to analyze all things, relax and calm, whitout being shy or stressed. It is the benefts that everyone needs to have. ",8,7,6,7,7,7,2686,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
766,3894,7138786DA45C,"Is it a good idea to finish high school in three years than four years? Four years is to long to graduate from high school. In four years you do a lot of things you can participate in many activities. For example: sports, clubs and help the teachers. High school is an important and necessary step to get to the successful, is a requirement in life because of the education and the things that you should learn. The school will help you in life to know how to act and guide you in what is better and you get a better life with school. School should be just 3 years instead of four. In four years the student learn more, but I dont think is necessary to be in the school all that time. Three years of high school is a challenge. The student have to be after school and take classes during summer is a lot of stress and a lot of things to do, but is not impossible. If the student want to success in life it doesnt matter how much time it will take the only thing that is important is to accomplish the goals. I am agree with the idea to finish high school in 3 years, I think that 3 years are enough for the student to learn all the stuff that needs. high school is hard but not impossible to finish, and is a good idea to push the students to graduate before, there are better opportunities and the only thing that I think when someone is telling me that I have to be more time in the school is ""Ill be old when Ill finish the school"" and that doesnt sound good. Its better 3 years than 4 because, you get a job, you get on the college earlier and you accomplish your goals before what you expect. Most of the kids are looking for end the school early, is a good motivation for the students that they will end the school early. In that way maybe the majority of the teenagers will be more focus on what they are doing, and have a better future. The majority of the people when is young always think about that they leave school because they dont want to end when they get old. Thats why I like the idea. Before you finish high school, before you get in the college and you do not finish the university to old. Plus, you have better opportunities and also you dont waste your time. Even four years is not a bad idea because you do more and you learn more and you can get more information. You have the same facilities even if you finish early or you take more time. Four years Is good but not all the students like to do the same thing in that time and they get bored. Four years is a good option, but three years or less sound better. Both options have a good opportunity to be in a good university. It just depends on what the student wants to do and what decision it will make.

If I havent told you what their names are, Ill tell you right now! My brothers name is Generic_Name, and my sisters name is Generic_Name, My name is Generic_Name. My siblings are pretty annoying, but I still love them. It was really sunny, and warm, Then this cute guy came, and right away I text my friends about it. My brother somehow started playing with Generic_Name. Generic_Name told me he already knew Generic_Name. He had a really cute little sister, and shes two years old, and her name is Generic_Name, and Generic_Name is ten years old. I asked Generic_Name what his brothers name was, he told me it was Generic_Name. When Generic_Name told me his brothers name, my heart started beating really fast, I was really happy that I would do anything in this world. Generic_Name comes up to me, and says hi, I was really nervous, me and Generic_Name were talking while are siblings were playing. We got to know each other, and now were best friends. Im so glad I met Generic_Name! We have so much things in common, we both like the same sport, which is soccer. The saddest thing is that we dont go to the same school, I go to Generic_School, and he goes to Generic_School. We got each others instagram, snap chat, and our phone numbers. We all wanted to hang out again, but tomorrow Its going to rain, and Its going to be really muddy, and wet outside. We got home, and we ate dinner, we all took a shower, and did our night routine. I had so much notifications from my friends, I totally forgot i sent them a text, I told them everything that happened. We had school tomorrow, and me and my friends were talking about it, but Generic_Name didnt seem as happy, as we all did. She told me she needed to talk to me, but in secret. So we went to the library. Generic_Name told me she knew Generic_Name, and she told me so much bad thing about Generic_Name. Generic_Name is Generic_Names ex girlfriend. I was very upset, and started crying, I went straight to my house, and Generic_Name came with me too, shes my best friend, and shes always there for me, when I really need her the most, I told Generic_Name what Generic_Name told me. Generic_Name told me that all those bad things she told me about Generic_Name arent true, she did that, so I would stop liking Generic_Name. I called Generic_Name that I needed to talk to him, so I gave Generic_Name my address. Generic_Name came over, I told him everything that Generic_Name told me, he told me she was lying, because shes jealous of me, and she liked him, but Generic_Name didnt feel the same way as Generic_Name did. Generic_Name told me that he liked me since the time, he made eye contact with me. I really didnt expect Generic_Name telling me that, I thought he would never like me. I dont trust a lot of people just my best friends, and my most favorite teacher, because the people that care about you the most, are the ones that want the best for you, theyre not jealous of you, like Generic_Name was. Girls shouldnt change over a guy that doesnt feel the same way as you do, and boys shouldnt either! God has someone waiting for you! If you really trust someone, dont loose their trust! A lot of people can give bad or good experience to you, but you have to see whos being a bad friend to you, and whos being a good friend to you. There are a lot of people that can give you bad influence, and a lot of people can give you good influence. Be careful in who you trust, there are several people that are there for you no matter what. If there is something wrong with you, talk to the person you feel more confident talking to, you can talk to your mom, dad, your principle, counselor, dean, or anyone you truly trust. Theres always a time where you accept some bad friendships, that give you bad influence, but its okay. I did to for accepting my friendship with Generic_Name, if she really was a good friend, she would of told me she wants the best for me, and not lie about something that isnt even true, When someone lies to you, its hard for you to gain their trust. You have to learn your lesson to the people that lie, your realize how you loose friends by just lying. Me and Generic_Name are now dating, we are focusing in school, because school is important, and no matter what others say, me and him are going to be happy, and no one will ever change that.

Personally I do agree with Prime Minister Churchill many times on my life I have fail, and fail again but I got up because I knew that there was a good price at the end. Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again. My Dad once told me Always try never give up. Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasnt even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didnt know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didnt just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end. It dosent matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesnt matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.

My point of this statement is that the first impression its possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressionas or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not.

773,3901,BD8683F93B5A,"Dear Generic_Name I understand that you are considering the benefits of working with a group or working alone. This could be a big deal depending the class because the majority of students prefer to work alone, we should use some of the time that we have in class to vote and see what students want, but i agree with the idea of working with a group for two reasons: we can devide the work and you get to talk to other students while their working. First reason is that it feels like we do get the enough time to work, when we get to work with groups everything gets a lil bit more easy because there is less work to do, and if they decide to work alone, you would notice that they are going to have more problems completing the assignment, while the other studens that are working in group they would find this assignment more easy, so the way the teacher dont have to spend to much time with only one student. Second reason is that they should not have problems finding the information because while some of them are writing the other students should it be serching for anwsers, for example, students that are working alone they would find this a lil bit harder because they have to do the writing and searching part by them self. The best part of working with a group is that the work can be finished a lot faster and they can have more time to recheck the work and make sure that you are not missing anything in blank. Also, there is a lot of benefits of working with a group or working alone, but its clear that those students are not going to work with other students because they say that they dont like to be talking to other students, that they prefer to work alone, but anyways the teacher should be agree with this, thats how she would know if you need more help with the assignment then other students. I strongly believe that working with a group could be the best choice for students because they are not going to spend to much time doing the assignments, so you could work with someone and devide the work wich positively affects, therefore, we must try it and see what benefits can we get from this and voting could be a good idea to decide if students would like to work in group.

But technology is taking over the world because for example stores are getting shut down because you can now buy anything on the internet theres no point of having stores everyone now uses amazon or eBay to stuff that you would find in Walmart. And a lot of stores are already out of business like Kmart because stuff you would find at Kmart are on amazon or eBay. Cars can be bought online you dont need to go to the dealer ship you now just get your computer and look for the you want and they can deliver the car right to your house .Also we have Tesla which are cars that are electric and you charge them instead of putting gas in them and also they this feature called Autopilot which means the cars drives by its self and all you have to do is pull that switch on and then just have your hands on the steering wheel for safety reasons but they are trying to make it where you only have pull the switch and just look out the window also they are very fast it can beat a Lamborghini and when you brake you are charging the battery .But also people are losing their jobs because of this but they can also work using technology instead of working at a store they work at a Amazon factory plus they pay very well .So what do I think of technology I think its awesome because it gives you new opportunitys that we use to not have when technology did not exist.

First, when working from home I can take breaks so I dont get stressed or angry. Some students need time to finish their assignments and not be counted as late. Students possibly have late assigments because they get stressed during school hours and they dont want to do it at home. However, if they work from home, they can complete those assignments at anytime and still get a 100%. In addition, some students like to work on the computers better than on paper. For example: I like working on the computers because I like to multitask, so in this case I prefer working on the computers more then on paper. Mulltitasking is better for me because I like to listen to music and do some homework. Multitasking is a skill and not everyone has it. Lastly, some students dont want to leave their family and prefer to be at home. For example: I have a sister that cant leave my mom, and I bet that she prefers doing school work from home. Personaly I prefer working from home and not leave my family. However, we do need to leave them at least when were 20-21 or sooner. Working from home would benifit me because I get to be on the couch and not be sitting under the desk. I do like the confert at my house better then in public scools. Overall, Working from home would benifit me because I like to work on the computers, I can take breaks, see my family, and be on my couch.",7,6,7,7,8,6,1295,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
777,3905,D84024335230,"People are love challenges and learn new languages. There are 67 languages have spoken in the world, 8.9% of us speak Vietnamese. Vietnamese is on top 10 hardest language has spoken. My skill is can speak Vietnamese fluently. I can do a lot of things with Vietnamese, such as translate English to Vietnamese, teach my friends how to speak Vietnamese and to communicate with others Vietnamese. I can speak both Vietnamese and English at the same time, so thats mean I could translate from English to Vietnamese or even Vietnamese to English. Dont you think it would be helpful for your parents when you re on a family vacation. That is my main job whenever I go out with my mom, because she doesnt speak English or able to understand it. My friends are love Vietnamese, they always convince me to teach them this amazing language. When I come to my class my friend start saying ""Xin Chao"" it means ""Hello"" in English, Im so glad that they love and want to learn it. I had a friend who is American, I taught him how to speak Vietnamese, and now he can speak Vietnamese like his home language. However it would be helpful if you are in Vietnam or a place where the most Vietnamese people lives, you could ask them in Vietnamese when you need help( I bet if you are from a foreign country and you can speak Vietnamese, they will think youre super cool). I remember that one time, I had a family reunion and I went to Vietnam. Then I was lost, I tried yell ""Help me, I lost, I cant find my parent"", but they couldnt understand what I was said, luckily I can speak Vietnamese, I asked them where is the police station so I could find my parents. Overall, Vietnamese is the perfect language to learn if you want to challenge yourself. It would help you a lot if you want to visit Vietnam one day.",7,7,7,7,6,8,3019,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
778,3906,92B418CEA06E,"My mothers uncle Generic_Name wanted to be a lawyer, he did all the step that everyone do for go to college and he started work hard for pay all his classes. Generic_Name woke up every day early in the morning and he went at the college, after he took a bus for his job. After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we dont try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,well never grow because well never have the enough experience and a better quality of life. First,well never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience well have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesnt matter that we good. Second,Well have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others. well have all the thing that one day we wanted an the most important thing well have the power to help other. For example,when we continue learning more and more well stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way. In summarize,Im agree with Emersons statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday. The success,the opportunities,better condition of life and the happiness is part of never stop grow. Is really important for everyone be happy with ourselves is like wake up every morning see us in front the mirror ,and say I can be better tomorrow.",7,6,7,7,7,7,1941,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
779,3907,AEF788DA28DE,"I think that the principal should not change the school policy because there are many students in school that the only thing that make them happy is sports; and that is what makes them stay away from trouble. But if you take that away from them there going to have nothing and they wont be looking forward to going to school. And they may feel that they are not good in any thing but sports; and it motivates you to be better in school it teaches you how to cooperate with other student , how to be a good leader/captain, and many more. Thats why I think that the principal should not change the school sports policy.",6,6,8,6,6,7,2355,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

I know a lot of kids in my class that are failing. Kids in my class surely text a lot to the other kid in school.

781,3909,B7350254EE93,"Why people should make their own decisions for them self. Should people make their own decisions? yes people should make their decisions because important, people will accomplish more faster, and teaching responsibly. People make decisions important. Everyone wants to feel like they play an important role in the family. By allowing your children to help decide entertainment or snack types, you give them a place in the family where they realize their voice are heard. from something as simple as deicing which good thing to buy they can feel like they are a part of the family more so than will be present they simply want to matter. When people make their own decision people will accomplish more faster. When you know exactly what you are trying to achieve, you can do it faster period. I doubt that requires more explanation speed comes from greater clarity of purpose and process. People make decision teaching responsibility. Not all decisions can be met with a successful experience. Perhaps a child picks a movie that is not as good as he or she thought it would be or dessert was disappointing in last. This can help you teach you child to learn from previous experiences. He or she needs learn that not all decisions have a good and positive out come and we learn from this process to make better decisions next time. Should people make their own decision, it is important for themselves, and important role in the family. People can teaching a child decision have good things and positive. When people make decision they will accomplish more faster you can know exactly what you are trying to achieve.",7,6,7,7,7,7,2463,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
782,3910,9BF717F45D68,"Did you know that one of our students got 1000 dollars cash price because our principal put him in one of our school activity ! Our principal told us that we should participate in at least one of our school activity. First I did not like it. Then I thought of one kid that went to my school and got a 1000 dollars just because he was good at his activity. So I agree with this decision because students can get to know each other, students can a college degree, and it helps them learn new things. This activity can get students and new students to know each other. They can find there new best friend in there. New students can get out of there shy sell and can make new friends there. Even old students can make new friends there too. Probably the whole class room can become friends ! Kids can get to know each other more better if there in a school activity. If a student is good or great at there activity. They can also get a big college degree in it. Like Art or sports. there art work can go in a Art Show or in sports you can go in a big show ! Maybe you can get a college degree in any activity. Also can get money and a college degree. Students can learn new things in there school activity. Students dont know yet what and what not there good at yet. So students need to try out for these activates so they can know. Student can explore too. They still have time to try out new things and to find out what there good at. They might be good at drawing and they just dont know it yet. Probably your good at drawing too. Theses school activities can help you and your future out. Students can get to know each other more, students can get a collage degree, and students can learn new things. Students can get better in school with this and there future can be made with this too. I think this is going to be a good plan for students and kids.",6,6,6,5,7,6,2075,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

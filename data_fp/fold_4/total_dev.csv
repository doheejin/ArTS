0,2107,93EF5F755313,"To who may concern. The Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", is well know that some people believe in this statement and some other dont. There are some reasons to believe this is true: one, failure gives experience to do it better next time, two, failure makes one think about different possibilities to be prepare to control the situation, three, failure gives the option to try again. First, failure gives experience; this helps to learn how to dont make the same mistake. For example, to learn how to cook is a ""try and fail"" because one needs to put a specific amount of spices and vegetables is a long process to give the food a good flavor; failure said what are the mistakes one needs to correct like to dont put much sugar in the cake or dont put much salt in the salad. Another example, learn a new language is difficult in various forms like the pronunciation or the form to make a sentence; failure give experience to improve abilities like these too. Second, failure makes one think about different possibilities. For example, if one try to built a ship inside a bottle and fail because the little pieces of the ship broke inside for dont be careful, that persons if going to think about what can make the pieces break next time to avoid the same situation. Another example, if one flew a kite and a bird or the wind make the kite crash, the next occasion ""what can make the kite crash?"" is going to be a possibility to think. Third, failure gives the option to try again. For example, take a test driver and fail but still studying to take it again; to get the necessary score to pass, this show that person decide to try again. Another example, when one try to learn how to do a magic trick, the first times fail is guarantee, but with perseverance one can be the best magician, this can be only reached if one decide to try again after fail. Although, one can learn from the failures, is not necessary fail to success, but sometimes one cant decide to dont fail; fail is a form to learn something from the mistakes, for example, fail to do something can make one know what is wrong and what is necessary to do to correct and prevent a future failure. In conclusion, one dont need to fail to learn, but ""perseverance is the key for success"" and when one go from failure to failure without giving up; the action to dont give up show how capable is that person to success.",7,6,7,7,5,5,1961,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

2,2718,AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I dont think its a good idea. But who am I to judge other peoples opinions. So im going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because there either doing school work or there to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

3,2053,DD00E48BC258,"Honestly, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The pursuit of success in life is achieving it in many ways.. Therefore, you can push yourself to be successful by putting in effort.. Failure can lead to serious conflict because then you will not be able to succeed. The important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success is not agreeable because you can overcome obstacles, aiming the goal to success, and to achieve the plan to .success. First reason, is to overcome the obstacles, for that you must have to work hard. Also, it takes practice the better you get to succeed. Do not give up on something you are overcoming in life. One of the biggest problems that people have in life is not overcoming what they are afraid of and from being afraid will not get you to succeed. Most of all to overcome the obstacles. is to try them not to give up on them. Second reason, putting a great effort can lead to improving. Efficiently the work you do can increase a great impact towards your achievements. In order to achieve a method, working pays off and by earning it. For example, people push themselves to making progress. Others might work hard in different ways to be successful and to aim what they want. Eventually, when making progress towards something, can influence the goal your improving. Third reason, to plan the success is to try achieving what your aiming for. In other words, enthusiasm can be those people that want to be successful in life. Pursuit also aims for the goal your trying to influence. When planning goals, is the most valuable thing to achieve. There must always be a plan towards the target you aim. Majority of the people, look for something easy they can achieve in their future goal and that is how they succeed. Finally, the key to being successful in life is by achieving it. To be honest, I do not agree about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of improving. Many people find success by putting in effort and time towards big things. It is not to late to start pushing yourself to be successful and being something in life. Therefore, is it not an important role that failure plays in pursuit of success, and to achieve the plan to succeed ",6,6,6,4,6,7,3134,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

5,2363,D10BBD82D66F,"Former Primer Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"", and in my opinion I agree with Churchills words. Failure has a enormous role in success. Failure is all about, learning from the mistakes you made and gaine all the experience you can out of it, Not giving up and plan what can you do better to accomplish what you have been fighting for to get even better results that the ones you were expecting in the first place, that is what failure is all about and that is why it has big and important a role in the pursuit of success. Learning from the mistakes that were done is a big example of the role that failure has on the pursuit of success; throughout history there had been many times were our society, nation, and specie had learned from their mistakes; as an example of this is the League of Nations, it was created after WWI to maintain worldwide peace; It end up being a big failure. we learned from this and the U.N was created to maintain global peace through nations and till present days it stills been one of societies biggest success. this is an example of how learning from mistakes you have made in the past is useful but overall this is one of many examples you can put to show how failure is related to success. Not giving up is also really important on this because giving up is not an answer as an example of this is, Pele, he became one of the best soccer players in history but it also became the youngest player to win a world cup, since a really small age he was told that he was never going to become a soccer player, he was told numerous time that his talent was not enough, but he did not gave up, he gave all he had and when he had the chance he showed everyone of what he was capable of and became one of the best players in the world. In his debut on first world cup he suffered an injury on his knee while training for the first match, it let him out for half of the of world cup. Doctors told him that he had to do exercise every day to get better, but that he was not going to be able to play in the whole tournament; he did not give up he trained day after day and in the third phase of the world cup he was given an opportunity to play in one of the games. This is a great example of the strength that people have when they do not give up and they give all they are capable of. This is also a great example that shows how failure has many things directly related at helping people to success at what they are trying to achieve. Another example of how failure can help you success is trying once more. this is the most important feature in the relationship of failure and success because once you have looked back at what you did wrong last time and learning from that, you are ready to try once more and accomplish what you have been fighting for. As an example of this is the spaceships that have send to space to reach many places in the universe. Its well known that many of the spaceships that have been send to space failed, and in really big proportions. Many of those spaceships exploded do to problems on their systems or other problems. After many tries looking at what failed and what went wrong humans were able to send satellites and people to the outer space, it took many failures to till we got all of this finished, now we are able to send spaceships throughout the galaxy to explore the stars and many other places. failure taught us what were we doing wrong, and we learned from it, this shows us of how failure is related to success by trying many times to achieve what you are fighting to achieve. Many people believe that failure is not related in any way to success, they have arguments saying that, you can accomplish something at the first try, that you do not learn anything from the mistake or the times you have failed at something, and they also say that you lose all enthusiasm when you fail numerous times at something. I believe this people are wrong because you do not always accomplish something in the first try, and you always learn from your mistakes, you might learn valuable lessons out of them; their last argument can be denied by telling to yourself that you can do it, we decide when do we lose our enthusiasm or not. this is why I believe they are wrong failure is related in the pursuit of success even if we want it or not because you learn and gain experience out of it, that is what makes this world a better place, failure, and it might sound like is not true but I believe it is; failure is always there and we can always learn valuable lessons out of it. Like I stated in my examples above failure is related to success; failure is not a bad thing because we learn from the mistakes we have done, we can gain experience out of it, we learn what are we doing wrong, but what we have to keep in mind is that we decide if we lose the enthusiasm in something whenever we decide to do it, this is why I believe that the words that Winston Churchill said are true, because from failure to failure we learn from the mistakes we made along the way to success, we can think of a better plan with the things we learned and after that we can try once more to accomplish the thing we have failed with better results that those we were expecting. That is why I think that failure is related to success. ",7,7,8,7,6,6,2885,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
6,2693,D139A5C53DE9,"Most people create their own way or destiny to go in life. They also know that believing in themselves will improve their capacity and potential to be successful. People who are motivated all the time tend to rich a 99% of their goals easily at school or Colleges. As they know being focus is the key to succeed in life. But those who has never tried are the ones to come last , because they do not have enough motivation or self-confidence to do it. In some cases people are reponsible for their own motivation in life and whatd help them to be successful it is to take good decison. There are so many opportunities out there, that will make us to be better and what we dont have to do is to make mistakes that will lead us to bad life style. Because later on we wont have second chance to prove our skills and be someone important to admire. Although people who has a positive attitude are trustful, smart, and kind etc. Even they could help people to reach their dreams. But not always people have the same motivation or satisfaction to stand up and fight for what should be helpful and worthy. Most people tend to give up, because they think its complicated or hard to get it. But if they do not put a bit of effort to make it wont happened. The success of a person is being dedicated all the time and no matter how hard its going to be. But they will always give their lives to make it real and thats when they realized that all the effort was for a good reason to be on where they are now. Those who keeps a positive attitude are the ones to inspire other people by writing books, quotes, poems, etc. People look at them as a way to motivate themselves and believe they can do the same to reach their goals. Sometimes people apply their concepts as how to be successful in life and what it is required to the success of school. People just have to be apassionate for things they love to do in their daily life and the opportunity to prove they are better. Even they will shine like a pearl for the effort and work ethic. They used to give to be positionated far way from others like one of the success person ever seen before. School, Grades, Homework are important to the success in life. When people tries the best to do well at school theres an increase of chances to be committee for an University, because they look for all the things students do well and because the success for people is believe on what they can do right and how can do it to bright out there.",8,8,8,8,5,7,2888,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
7,618,C6EB01B2D6B8,"MY SCHOOL SHOULD NOT FOLLOW THIS MODEL BY EXTENDING THE SCHOOL DAY BY TWO- HOURS The addition of two hours to the school day will benefit the school poorly but, will cause a huge disadvantage to students and the school as a whole. The four - day work week will not be beneficial to my school because, it would reduce the amount of time students have for other activities, and also this will result in the inability of students to learn more, and as a result students are affected mentally and psychologically. To begin with, the school day has been designed in a special way which gives students, a reasonable amount of time to involve themselves in after school activities. These activities help the students acquire other skills different from what we acquire in school. For example, students who also take part in sports do not have enough time to practice or train after school if these 2 hours are added. Other students who work after school will begin to work fewer hours because they also need time to study and revise. As a student, time is needed to attain your goals and time also determines your future. In addition to, the student brain cant function as well as an adult brain after some hours of serious work .The brain becomes tired and needs rest after some time, but the adult brain can do more because it is well developed than the student brain. After lunch, the students can study to a maximum of 3 hours only before feeling sleepy or tired and if these hours are extended, students will feel reluctant to study, which makes these extended hours a waste of time. Due to this, students wont take these hours seriously but will only disturb or disrupt the class which produces no positive result at the end of the class. The school makes sure that wastage of time is extremely prevented to produce positive outcomes and results. Furthermore, to become a successful student, individuals must be mentally upright and psychologically sound to allow learning to be much easier and convenient. If these 2 hours are added to the school day, the students wont be mentally stable because, they would be stressed from pushing themselves to learn more even tho they are tired. Psychologically, this will reduce a students ability to understand new things being thought and also prevents them from revising past information or work given. If this is happens, students will begin to forget past information and how to apply them which will become a problem in the near future. Conclusively,this four - day work week would benefit other other institutions but wont benefit an institution like my school because my school works and remains successful mainly by the use of precious time and effort.

I think that this is an good idea because if the school follow this model by extending the school day two hours the benefits are you have more time for study and complete all your work three days to relax in home and do your homework or get a jod and work for three days all this is a benefits.

11,428,A28E9B475935,"My mother always said, ""You will never learn if you stay at home, go to school to learn more things."" Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus. Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example, Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus. To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home.

Teachers in schools say they have problems with kids attitudes this year of how they approach others, and of how they approach their teachers too.

The first reason I think that schools must have an after school homework club is because students who are having difficulty in class can get extra help form their teachers and students. One time I had trouble understanding how to answer the questions my teacher gave to me about the civil war 2 years ago, and my teacher said that I could stay after school in the homework club and to meet her their. That was the reason how I understood how to answer the questions on the quiz. That is one reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club. The second reason why I think that schools must have a after school homework club is so students could improve their grades in their classes. One time I had a D in my science class because I needed more help with remembering the parts of a cell. My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell. One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test. This is the second reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club. The third reason why I think that schools should have a after school homework club is so teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs. One time I stayed after school for the homework club and a teacher was having a heard time explaining a question to a student who spoke Spanish.

The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food.

Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up. Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self. In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well.

I really like how, all the teachers at Generic_School, teachs to the students they, teachs to you really good. I already read the Prompt, and, I would like to describe that, and give my opinions, and reasons. so lets started This. I know that so many students, want to have, some educationals experiences in some activities, but others Students do not want to be in activities, others students want to have all the homeworks, done. they dont want to Miss anything, at school and its ok, If they want to be in an activities. Of course that the school always should have The students control. Because students can have all very good without problems, and thats why the school and the Teachers should have their controls, all the students should have all done, if they want to be in an activity, because If the school did not take the controls, of the students they will not respect, the schools and the activities rulers, my Opinon will be that students should have time to do some activities and they should have time to study, to do all the Homeworks, like they dont should have a lot of activities, they needed to do the homeworks to. for example, if i Would like to be in some activities like sports i have to do all my homeworks first,have good grades at school. i Know that the activities are good for your body, normally the body always need some activities, the school always Have some activities to do and thats really good for your body.

19,2254,FE6EC11C8877,"Should you relied on yourself or other about lifes important matters? Its important that people relied on their own instincts and ideas because if we have people picking chooses for others we would have no power on what we want, for example people who learn from them self are more active and confidant then the ones that have to learn from other, and wait for instructions. I belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. My first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. Infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better. My second reason is that if you let others choose for you, you will never learn to deal with hard thinking situations. Also you get to learn more about your self and you get to do stuff your own way and you also learn to love your self from your mistakes. I think that every person should make there own choose when it comes to hard momemts like when my grandma die my parent pick what we was going to do with her, and she didnt go ask some one what to do, no she knew what to do from expiriens of my grate grandma, and thats why some problems have to be dealt by your self. In conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.

I will use specific details and examples, to explaing why someone might find that activity enjoyable. For my opinion i think i will like to have a community, state, national park that has two fields. One basketball field with soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot. Then last but not least a tennis court. That would be cool. Then i will want the parks/play ground, to be split in two. One small play ground for little childrens under 9 years old. And then the other one will be for kids above 10 years old. Now i will describe what will i want to look like or have on the babies play ground from a 2/3 year old kid to 9. kids and parents will like to have tiny slides of a hight of 3 or 4 feet tall and have sings that are special for babeis. Then little benches were they can sit with there parents. After that i will like does little horses made of plastic or metal, that you can move back and forth. Then now i will tell you and describe you how can kids will love kids to have on the other park or play ground from kids from 10 and above. So maybe kids will love to have two fields because maybe they like to play soccer or basketball and tennis so one of them will be a basketball field with small soccer goals at the botton of the basketball hoot because a lot of kids like soccer and basketball. Then the other field will be a tennis field. What kids will love too is have to courts on one field too. Then for the slide i want four of the to have a hight about 6 or 7 feet tall and two with curls and the other two, just normal. Then the other biggest ones will be of a high of 10 feet tall and i will promise you that kids will love it! So they dont get bord and say; this is boring. This is for little kids, i dont like it!.

Some of them has a job, maybe with that same job. I think some of them they have a chance to surpport they family. Maybe they leave lonely, far aways from they family, or they have to help theire parent pay the rent, or other stuff to pay in they own too. I think they will have a benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because the schools give them a new way to progress. First of all I think its would be a great benefit is, at same same time you can do other activity, and you can took it whenever you want, before or after work it all depend on what you think will be better for you. Secondly if you have some family problem or you have to go somewhere immediately for a long time. That is an opportunity for you to learn or to not loss all the days you have been absent at the school.

Do not conform of what you already have try to be better, because if you do not try you would not get chance to do thing and you probability would not grow. In my opinion you should try new things and not be stock in what you already mastered because ,You can learn new things, You can grow as a individual and as a community and You can help others. When you try new things we learn because the make us grow, for example if you want to open a buisness of finances in your community but you do not know how because you never try to do it you ask someone that have already mastered of doing it and you can start doing your buisness because you already try and you learn how to do it. another example would be going to college and there is a class that you already know because you take it in high school and you explain the thing to your friend and you are a mastered doing it and one of you friends ask you for another class problem but you do not because you haven try the class but it sound interesting and you want to try it because you want to learn new thing and try not matter what your situation is in your life be confident of your self. other example would be try to cook and learn your self that can teach you that you can try by your self and learn by your self but you try and that what it matter you try. Try new thing help you learn and learn help you grow as an individual and as a community for example you grow as an individual because you take the class that you friend ask you before and you did it answer him because you haven even try then you try and become a mastered doing it and you open a buisness the community start growing and you open more buisness you become more important and the community grow more as well as you and you became someone important for the community and you keep having chance to be better every time that you learn you start helping people that do not have a chance to imprube them self. an for teach your self of cooking is a motivation to other to try the same thing. You can help people when you grow because you learn how to do the work and now you teach the work to other to they can have a better chance in life giving them a place to work and having them grow as well the community grow because the buisness that you open people was more interesting in your buisness and they make you offers and tell you to work with them but you are scared that you work may not work but you remember that if you do not try and stay of what you are mastered you would not grow. cooking your self help the community to have people to get in head and teach others. Even if you do not have try something and you think you can do it and you fell, you would be more sad that you do not try before you do it or ask someone for help that ready do it is a big mistake, try before you do not grow ,you do not have to be conform of what you already have because you can help others and make your self be proud and cooking for other and tell then that you learn by your self is a inspiration to other do the some thing and the way that you grow as trying thing would make the community more interesting try to grow before you give up.",6,5,6,5,4,7,918,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I agree with what the scientist Albert Einstein said the imagination is more important than knowledge because you can have more fun, and you can discover a lot of new things, also you can enjoy life more. To begin with you can have more fun because you can be really entertained while creating new things like when you start a new project you can have a lot of ideas, and you can enjoy explaining them, or drawing them, you can have fun too when you are making those ideas come to life because you imagine them just how you want them, and you can have fun too by learning in the process something like you may not know, and you can apply them on your project just by using your imagination because you are the only one who knows how you want it. Also you can discover new thing maybe you would not Know is the thing that you are creating could work, and there you can discover a lot of ways to work more well, or you can also discover, and learn more thing like what to use, or how to put thing right, but thats not the only thing, for what you can use your imagination for, you also can use it when you are drawing or writing histories like when you write you can discover a lot of knew words, or when you are drawing you can discover where you can put lines in the right spot, or at what measure, you also can discover how well you can draw. Finally you can enjoy life more because you would not be so stressful, and you can enjoy imagine, and in my thoughts when you imagine you are in your own world you can imagine what ever you want, and you would not be worry about what the people is going to say about you I think Im an example of it because I like to draw a lot and when Im thinking about what I want to draw I always forget about everything, and I really enjoy drawing, and I also like to go out a lot because of that because when I go out I see a lot of thing and when I want to draw I always imagine them, and then I draw them more colorful than how I saw them and I really enjoy it. In conclusion imagination is more important than knowledge you can have knowledge but if you dont have imagination you wont see life the same because when you imagine you can have more fun, see life different, and you can discover a branch of new thing you wold see life more colorful, and you can also enjoy life more how I already say you can have knowledge, and you can have and do a lot of things with it but if you have imagination you can have the whole world just by imagining.",7,5,7,6,6,7,3894,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
25,1410,D0CC47FFC293,"To have a good life we need to have a good way of think, it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Im agree with that statement because a positive attitude make you a better person, and makes your life easy, with a positive attitude your been optimistic and that is very importan during hard times in life. There are a lot of importants reason why it is important to have a positive attitude. A positive attitude is the key to succes in life because you will have a good relationship with people. People like to be around a person that has a good attitude and is optimistic because they know that you are always going to try to help others and you are going to keep a good attitude during adversities, also if you have a good attitude people will know that they can count on you. You can give people good advices as well as a constructive opinions. Conversly if you have a negative attitude you are going to transmit a bad energy, and people will stay away from you. Thats why is very important to have a good attitude because you are going to be surround with people that has a positive attitude too. Also a positive attitude is important because it will help you to solve problems easily. If you are calm and keep a positive attitude during problems you will find a better solution for problems. If you are positive you will try to think in a way to solve the problem without stressing too much. Also if you have a positive attitude you will not give up easily during hard times. People who have a negative attitude always struggle when solving problems, because they think that maybe the problem does not have solution or if it has is to hard to solve it. Negative people always focus on the bad side of things thats why it is very hard for them to handle problems. Thereby is important to keep a positive attitude, no only because it will help you, but also because you will be more happy. Another reason why is important to have a positive attitude and why I think is the key to succes in life is because I have seem that people who have a positive attitude are more happy than people that have a negative attitude because they stress for little things that happen , positive people are always trying to see the good side of things, they know everything that happen, happen for a reason and that everything has solution, we just need to look for a way to solve it. People with positive attitude always make better choices than someone negative. For example; The majority of the people with negative attitude give up when they dont reach what they want instead of strive their goal. Largely people with positive attitude always keep going and fighting for their goals until they reach it. In conclusion a positive attitude is very important to be successful because, it will help you to make a strong relationship with people. Also it is important because you will always find a way to solve conflicts, if you keep a good attitude you also are going to make good chices. You are going to be happier and live peaceful because you are not going to stress about everything .

Just think about the transportation from the school. If a student live in a rural area they have to wake up at 5 A.M to get ready for school because from his/her house is one hours away for the school. If the student planning to stay after school she/he may not get home at 7 P.M. And he/she have to get home before 7 P.M to be available to do her/his homework.

If the school board add one and a half hours for each school day, all the students can learn more thing. The last reasons why the school should not add one and a half hours because the cost of electricity. Every years the school board have to pay over 6 millions dollars. If the school board spend over 6 millions to the electricity every years then how many millions for every thing else. The school board will not have a lot of money let to updates the school.

Its also really important for my Dad to give me his wisdom, Because I cant imagine doing stuff without someone helping me on things that I dont even know about. It just helps me to stay more focus in my work by just hearing from someone Like my Dad. It makes me want to try harder than other people and be better than them. And lastly it will make me think smarter and push my self to be the best I could be. So I think its kinda obvious that every person or even smart people needs help sometimes from someone thats has an experienced before. Because by just hearing from them will teach you new ways new ideas and even stuff you didnt even know existed. Everyone is not perfect in this world and everyone definitely needs helps on something it doesnt have to a big thing it can be a very small things. But I think by just hearing from someone that has an experienced before will definitely help you to be better person.

31,2894,4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better. First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other. ""Everyday we all learn new things in life"". Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didnt understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didnt understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group. ""We could do more if we all help each others"". Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, dont do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they dont understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes. In conclusion, theres a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you dont have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone. ""Sometimes you will need a little help from others in order for you to improve"".

32,293,87692B9A8184,"Have you ever felt that the weekend isnt enough? that you might wanted to do some kind of activities during weekend, but the time wasnt enough. I bet that you did it, and Im going show you my point of view of why we should keep having a normal school week of five days instead of a four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a four-day school week by adding two hours each day. Actually, my school should not adopt that kind schedule, because the standard week with eight hours each day increases the productive time, and the standard week allows student to do other activities after school, such as: work, to do homework, sports or even spend more time with family and friends. Those who believe that the school should changed their schedule from standard five-day work week to a different schedule model that consists of ten hours per day have their reasons. They think that weekends arent enough and they really need and extra day off to cover their needs. They also think that two extra hours each day are not a big sacrifice, knowing that they are going to have an extended weekend and making the same amount of hours which means the same paycheck amount, and they might have time. One reason why the school should not changed their schedule of five-day school week to four-day school week is because, the standard week of five days increases the productive time of each student. In this case students might feel tired of being ten hours in school, and at the end during the last period of class they wouldnt pay attention to the class, because they would feel to tired of had spent almost half-day in school. As example of this is myself. If my school adopt this new policy, I wouldnt be able to keep my grades high and I wouldnt pay attention to the last period of class, because by that time I would be tired and bored of have stayed that long and having classes the all day. Therefore the schedule of five-day school week should not be changed. Another reason why my school should keep its schedule of five-day school week is that, the standard week of five days gives the opportunity to do activities after school, such as: work, homework, sports or spend more time with our families. A perfect example of this is my friend, PROPER_NAME. PROPER_NAME goes to school, but he lives alone. So, he pays rent, his cell-phone payment and food. Then, he really needs to work after school to pay himself. If our school changes the schedule of five-day school week that each day is formed for eight hours, instead having a four-day school week of ten hours per day, but having an extra day off. PROPER_NAME would be involved on a problem, because he wouldnt be able to have a job after school. Therefore my school should not change its schedule of having five days of school. Based on the reason that I gave, its clearly to see that having four-day school week offers good benefits that the regular standard weed of five-day does not give, but I strongly believe that the five-day school week is way better then the four-day school week. Although some say that my school should adopt a new kind of schedule that some business are implementing called four-day work week that consists of extending the school day two hours. Actually, my school should not adopt this new idea, because the standard week formed by five day of eight hours increases the productive time, and it allows student to do different kind of activities like have a job, homework, play sports or even share time with family. Therefore four-day school week should not be accepted in my school. ",8,6,6,6,6,8,1788,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Being positive is the key to being successful in life, I think having a positive mind can help us in our bad circumstances of life and help us overcome bad time faster. Having a positive attitude will give allow you to have a good days. Others may think you do not have to have a positive attitude in order to be successful. Having a positive mindset will always help you get better opportunities, for example to get a better job or a better home or a better car, but everything requires that you have a positive mindset. Also having a positive mind will always help you to be better every day every time you overcome a bad situation you will become stronger or also every time you reach a goal, that will help you be better. Sometimes it is also necessary to be negative to understand or experience bad things or it can also help you be prepared for bad things, or also bad news or bad times. We have to try to be positive most of the time to be able to make good decisions and have better opportunities, but also being negative can help us make better decisions for ourselves. Different from how I think, people say if you are smart, why do I need a positive attitude? They believe someone can be successful just knowing the skills. There are those that believe if, you work harden than most you can be successful. In closing, it is my belief if you have a positive attitude you will have a successful and rewarding life. A positive mind will give you better opportunities, and great energy. It is not good to have a negative attitude.

The hardest part of school is getting ready. you wake up go brush your teeth and go to your closet and look at your cloths. after you think you picked a outfit u go look in the mirror and youll either not like it or you look and see a stain. Then youll have to change. with the online classes you can wear anything and stay home and you wont need to stress about what to wear. most students usually take showers before school. they either take it before they sleep or when they wake up. some students do both to smell good. that causes them do miss the bus and effects on there lesson time cause they come late to school. when u have online classes u wont need to miss lessons cause you can get everything set up and go take a shower and when u get out your ready to go. when your home your comfortable and you pay attention. it gives then an advantage to be smarter and even pass there classmates on class work. public schools are difficult even if you try. some teacher dont know how to teach it in then way that students understand it. that causes students to fail and they may repeat the class.

A lots of people think that if they dont do it in the first time, thats going to be it. They dont realize that if they just keep going theyre going to get there, and be success. Wouldnt it be great if we didnt have to fail? but thats how its some times. We have to accept it and keep trying. Life is fool of problems, but we just have hang in there and keep trying and get where we want. Another reason is that never loss of enthusiasm, thats the most important reason of all of this. if we dont have that exclusive word is like life does not make sense at all. For example, I used to have this friend that his mom wanted him to be a doctor, but he didnt want to be a doctor. He wanted to be a teacher. Farthermore, he study to be a doctor. He wasnt that good but that was what his mom wanted. The second year, which was even harder he just stop. He talked to his mom saying that was not for him. He did not have any enthusiasm on that career, so he fanilly started classes to become a teacher. now, that was for him. He did so much better, good grades and excellents jobs. In short, he never lost the enthusiasm to be a what he wanted. Some people migth say that you dont have to fail, that you have to be success all the time. They migth say that is not ok to fail. However, thats not true, you can fail its going to make you strong. you are going to have experience and youre going to do things so much better.

37,460,327F4BCC9E4B,"The idea that businesses have made is very important. Finding means to conserve energy and resources are important in our daily life. Most people use energy and resources in their day to day activities which put more pressure on the use of energy and resources. This four-day work week will conserve the workload on energy and resources. I agree to the fact that my school should follow the four-day school week with each day consisting of ten hours. When the school time is extended, it will make students have more time to do any unfinished assignments in a particular class. Students can do more work and cover many topics in a day. This will make teachers do a lot of work in a day. For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class. If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school. Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasnt considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage. In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

The other benefit will be to finish our work faster because everyone in the group will collaborate with some work that it will help us to finish the work without worrying to turn in the project late because we will help each other to get the work done and get a good grade as a group.

39,2332,A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Lets be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody elses ideas In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus mother). To catholic people Jesuss mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lies layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the churchs hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress peoples rights. In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion. I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My arts teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way.

The people that say yes they say that because when you know what career you want to take before entering high school you wiil choose you classes better depending in your career and what high school you want to attend because come schools have programs that count like college classes, and in high school you have only four years and that is not enough time for you to choose and you will end up in a carrer that you dont like if you choose the wrong one. If you know what you want to be you will cofus better in that career . You can join programs to help you more in your goals and when you know your goals you can achive them better. You also will try to see how can you get a scholarchip for your carrer and what college are better for you, and you will mead people that like the same thing as you and you can make friends. When you join programs some time you can get a scholarchip if you are good.

Is better to waste four years then wasting your entire live in a career that you dont like. you sholl try to get a scholarchip that way you dont pay for college. If you dindt have a scholarchip and finish college and you are working in a career that you dont like and you dindt have a sholarchip you are going to be in debt and you are going to pay alot.

Is depending in the choose you make. All of thise dipend in how you are because evryone is defferent and not everyone is going for the same opsion.

44,67,CB327222A71B,"I agree with the Author Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a word that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"", because the most important in this world is to be yourself. To be yourself is to make you unique and different for the others. Some of things is important to be yourself is: To be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let others people tell you to be different. The first is to be yourself. Some people things if you dont be yourself is to make you successful in their life, but the case is not that. To be yourself is make the people in your work, family, and friends see the real person you are. In my case when I came in the United States, I dont like to be myself because I was a little scared the kind of people was here. Every time people talk to me, they look me different. After we finished the conversation I feel bad because I know was not me. One afternoon my mom talk me, "" You need to be yourself, because inside you heart, you are a sweet person, beautiful, and you love help people."" In that moment I changed my life and the way I look people. The second things is to achieve goals by yourself is motivate you to continue do the right choices, and the things right. To be yourself had more opportunities for work, universities, and scholarship. To be yourself dont only implicate be a good person or help people, is to implicate say the truth, the things you think, and never lie to others people. To achieve your goals and objective is make proud of yourself in this world completely of opportunities. For examples, my sister for her dedication, and to be herself, so right now she is in college. To be herself, she achieve their goals and dreams, and she always saying the truth. The third things what is important is dont let other people tell you to be different. If always to be yourself, you always be successful in life. Some people say you needs to change because they are jealous or they dont like you. Whose say you needs to change is because they want the bad things for you. In my case, I dont remember very well, but one person say to me that, "" I need to change my personality."" In that same afternoon I go to tell my mom what this person say to me, and what my mom say to me was, "" Dont let any person to over shine the light you had."" In my conclusion, I feel this is very important for all people need to reflect, in this life the most important things is be yourself dont matter what. The are three things that one person never forget is to be yourself, to achieve goals by yourself, and dont let other people tell you to be different. If you let people do what ever they want with you life, you never be successful in life.",5,6,6,5,5,6,2772,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
45,2982,BE6A28051A30,"In my opinion, i completely agree with this association church statement. Success consists of going from failure to failure until you get what youre being fighting for, without losing your enthusiasm. However i realized that the time period its not the same to the one that were living on. Company Association, Churches, and Governments are not alike as before, because now if you are trying to achieve something and for some reason you failed, people will start judge on your acts that youre not capable to become your dreams reals. Eventhough failure plays an important role in the pursuit of success. I would like to share one specific example that fail is the promotion that brings you to success. I would like to lasso the example of your first day on your new job. We all passed through that situation , you feel like youre not lace in, in the directions that your boss or supervisor gave it to you to do and thanks to that some employees start laugh at you, about your failure and no one is loyal to come up to you and teaches you how to do it they stand by and wait until they see that you made it wrong then they try to help you. But, let me tell you something that you already know, the world isnt a rainbow its a very mean and nasty place and it doesnt matter how rude you are, it would put you into your knees and keep it permanently if you let it. Not you, not me, even no one hits that hard like life does. But, it doest care how it hits, the only thing that really cares is about how much you can take, how much you can get hit and keep moving forward. If you know what you worth, then go out and get what you worth, but you must have to be able to hold out hits and not to came and blame others and say; I cant be the person that i want to be, because of him or her, or anybody. Thats how winner is done. In summary all the proofs plays an important factor in how to be successful in life, sometimes is that shove that you needed to get higher. In addition to this, you have to be able to hold out the criticisms of others, if you are not capable your enthusiasm will get shrink and all the effort would be vainly.",6,4,5,5,4,7,2564,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
46,2081,CCDD77656701,"Do you thing that most danger of us lies not setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark? Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school. Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they dont do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you dont want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you dont go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you dont have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things. For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and dont tell anyone because some people dont want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they dont get it. Those kind of people dont want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and dont tell any body because you dont know what others want for you. Its better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesnt have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they cant do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you dont do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they dont want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it. When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they dont care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that dont like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to dont have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you dont want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you dont have those good grades and you just are copying others and when its test time you dont know what to do because you didnt do the work by your self. To get things that you want; you have to work for it. Its better to have friends that help each other and that also that help you to do your work and can be easy for you to also help others. People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they havent go through things like; one of your friends dont like you and they dont want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and dont tell everyone because you dont know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they dont care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they dont want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you dont stay in front of them as a looser because you didnt they dont know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that. Thats why people dont trust each others. Its better to do things that no body know because if you felt or dont get what you want, their will not be people that knew. You didnt get it and they will not be talking bad things of you or look at you as a looser that you cant do anything. You will be the only one that will know and if you want to tell them you can it will be your choice.

Guiding other will make people believe in what you are saying and that will make you feel great because you are teaching other what you have been taught. Influencing others can make others listen and hear what you have to say and then share it with others. Sharing there thoughts will guide people to doing good things in there lifes.

In life things arent easily handed to you if you want something bad enough you have to work hard for it if you wanna become a better version of yourself. Most people around the world look up to certain successful people and wish to become just like them with all the money, cars, and fame like the famous rapper "" Nba Youngboy "" which has made himself known through his music rapping about his life and difficult obstacles hes had to go through to make it where he is now. Growing in life and being successful isnt something thats going to happen over night it takes time and patience. With every task comes a difficult obstacle thatll try to put you down and make you wanna give up and people usually tend to give up easily. The only way you can over come obstacles and move forward is to get up from it and keep trying; Barack Obama one of our best well liked President worked hard for what he believed in and helped illegal immigrants around the country get an opportunity to get job legally. Obama had many difficult task but his passion and what he believed in never made him wanna give up he kept trying over and over again to grow and to help undocumented immigrants voices be heard too. Immigrants nowadays tend to have it harder than most people; they come from around the world looking for a better life, well paid jobs, and a safe home for their family. The majority of immigrants come with nothing but a couple clothes and shoes and usually no where to stay more than half of immigrants work twice as hard to get food on the table and clothes for their kids and wifes. The mindset of having goals and being passionate about something is a powerful tool, Many immigrants work hard enough to eventually become a U.S citizen which has a lot of obstacles to complete. For immigrants to learn the english language is difficult but after studying and working hard long hours they master it and they tend to grow in the american society, Which shows anyone if you really put your head into it you can accomplish anything.

Once said that ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" I belive, that failure is an important element that plays in the persuit of success, because the failure lead to succes, failure is unavoidable, learn from your mistakes, and the failures often leads to problems. One reason is the success that consist of going from failure to failre without loss the enthusiasm. Failure is unavaidable, the path of success is not a straight on. Every people have to fails sometimes in the life, but that is part of the life. For example sometimes, invest money in some bussiness, but we dont know if go to win a lot money, or lost all the money or just one part of money. If for some reason we fails, doesnt matter, we need to try again, maybe that would be the success to have your company owner. Never say not, before try it. Another reason, is to learn from your mistakes, if you make a mistakes at least you know, not to do it again. A failure might put end thing idea or opportunity, but lead you others. If you ready failure and you know what was the mistakes try to find a solution, and not come back with the same ideas, you need to learn for each mistakes. For example, if I say something wrong, like English word, if somebody heard me and corrigir me, I try to not say that word again. One more reason, failure often leads to problem, we need to solve our problems and getting throught difficul times makes you smarter and stronger as a person. By dealing with your failures you will to be prepared and have most experienced in the future. If you know that to fails before, so you are somebody with most experience in the life, you know that if you have a important roll in your work, that is why you to fails in some time, but you need always to continue ahead. Everyone have differents kind of problems, but each problem have solution. If for find solution is possible that we go to fails, just doing that, we need to solve each problem without doesnt matter what come ahead we always want the success. In conclusion, failure can change who you are, and what path youre on the life. To fails in our life is something that cannot to avoid, but we not wanted to be a failure always, we want to change and have success. Each mistakes is a success more in our life, I think that failure it plays an important role in the persuit for the success.

Technology today can do more things than the technology a few years ago. Technology today does have a positive effect on people because it can help people communicate with people around the world, and people can call 911 for an emergency. It helps people communicate with people around the world. For example my Uncle cant leave the country to go visit his mom but if he does he cant return to the states. So the technology now allows him to Skype or Facetime his mom when he wants. In fact 70% of the people around the world can communicate. All the people can now connect with anyone with just a simple button. People can call 911 for an emergency. For example my dad had witness a car crash when he was driving to work. When he saw the car flipped over he quickly got his phone and called 911. The cops came in like 3 minutes. When the cops arrived they quickly got the guy out of his car where he was flipped. So thankfully my dad was there to call 911 for him and saved his life. In fact 55% of people that call 911 save a life. So if you ever witness an accident call 911 because you might save a life. Technology does have a positive effect on people. It can help people talk to people all over the world. People can also call 911 for emergency.

Graduating a year earlier would be a great thing for student to do because there are people who are trying to manage work and school but its difficult for some people because they cant do both, If they work and they come late after work and the next morning they wake up tired from work that they are tired to go to school and it makes it difficult to go to work and then go to school. A reason why I feel students should graduate early is because if they graduate early they can go to college, and if college allows them to choose their hours they can decide on what time they can go to college or the days. It could also depend on what you want to do career wise. If they allow that you can work and go to college and it would make it easier for you and you wont feel tired after college to go to work. For example,My mom graduated early and she was able to work and and go to college as well. Another reason is that if you go to high school and work its difficult because you have to worry about school and work, sometimes thats a problem because when you come late from work and in the morning when you have to go into school your tired and you dont wanna go to school and your tired and you cant concentrate in school but I feel like when your in college you can choose your time and date and it makes it easier for you. For Example, I have a friend who works and goes to school to and he tells me its difficult for him to manage school and work and sometimes hes even tired to go to school. Even when hes at school hes tired and cant do any of his work because hes tired and its hard for him to concentrate. The last reason is if people were to graduate a year earlier from high school. They can also go to college and depending on on what they want in their career, they could also graduate college early and start you career early For Example, My Uncle graduated High school earlier and he also graduated college which made it easier for him to start his own business and it really helped him out in life and hes really happy because he graduated early. If you choose to graduate and do classes in the summer you would feel accomplished and you would feel relief you wont have to be there for 4 years and only 3 years.

58,645,35A1342EF397,"Is it good for a high school student to graduate in three years instead of the four year traditional? Lets call it the high school shortcut. Some school districts offer this opportunitie to high school students in order to make them graduate one year earlier. Based on my personal perspective, an early high school graduation is a very good experience for high school students. The high school shortcut makes student motivated to think about building their future quickly, increases the degree of their maturity and also help those students to proceed in life easily and faster. High schools should make sure that students are motivated to think about their future and help them by making sure theyre in the right path. Some students dont try to enter college right after graduating, some of them will take a year off and some of them dont try to enter college at all. By motivating to think about their future a mean that they would propably be more motivated to enter college at a young age than a certain type of age. Going to college and start chasing your dream at a young age will make students more mature. Life after high school is something serious weither you go to college or enter the military starting it at a young age would make students more ecxited and make them became mature at a young age. So with the high school shortcut students will have the ability of gainning a lot knowledge about the branche they want to study young and quicker. As soon as the high school students gain the knowledge that high school provides, proceeding easily and faster with the high school shortcut is and good opportunitie that should be chosen. Some of those high school students think that its a waist of time taking a four years high school knowing that a three year high school that provides the same type of knowledge is a possible choice for them. As far as Im concerned, I strongly believe that the high school shortcut which is graduating i three years instead of four years is a great opportunitie.

60,2606,2DE38160D46B,"I dont believe school should follow in businesses footsteps and do the four-day school week. I believe that school should stick with the five-day school week. Because it would be better for the students in the long run. If school keep the five-day school week there would be a lot of benefits with that. like if students have five-day school week there would be so much free time for students to do whatever they want like take care of responsibility, after school clubs, homework, study. And free time is way more useful to students. Now some can argue saying that if school had four-day school week they would have more time because they would have a extra day off of school. And that true but there a catch with that it only one extra day off like say if you were in a club and you meet on Thursday then you would have to show up to the club later because school was longer now of course im using that as an example. So if school did have the four-day school week then yes you would have a extra day but like I said before there would be a catch to it. Now even im not going to lie and say that five-day school week is the greatest thing they have there. They do have there down fall. Like for starter we have five days where we have to show up to school. And also school is long on enough with the five-day school week. So yea... five-day school week do suck too. In conclusion, I believe that school should keep five-day school week and not the four-day school week. As I believe that it is better for students in the long run.

Would you like to be treated like a criminal for the rest of your life with nobody talking to you or respecting you? 62% of the people around the world are not being treated with kindness or respect. People in many countries like Canada, France, and Russia are not being like a human being. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, that includes being nice, kind, and helpful to each other. In many countries people are not being treated right. 55% of the people have depression, loneliness, and sadness, because when they are not being treated with kindness they think no one likes or cares about them. Over 200 people around the world have committed suicide because they were not treated how they wanted to be treated. Not being kind or nice to others can cause damage to peoples feelings. People have been effected by other for not being treated correctly. Treating others with rudeness is not going to effect you or kill you, it is the opposite it will help you become a different and better person than you were before. Treating others with kindness can make peoples day wonderful. Some people might have a bad day and if you help them and treat them with kindness, they will feel a lot more better. Being nice to people will make your life a lot more easier and you will feel like you have accomplished something big. I strongly believe that people should start being nice to others even if they are not respecting you. Being nice and respectful to others is what everyone wants you to be, but if you do the opposite than your life is going to become harder. People should start treating others how they want to be treated, and that includes being nice, helpful, and kind to everyone.",7,8,7,7,7,8,1984,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
62,1159,6D6E937C3A67,"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate peoples characters, and makes them good in their own way. Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of peoples characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older. Peoples environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that persons character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him lets go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character. Culture has a big impact on a persons character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the persons character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture. In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. Peoples character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a persons character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other. This is a very important topic and it means a lot to me and other people Thank You for giving me the change to talk about it.

63,2051,4975FA2ABC9D,"In the future what would you like to accomplish in school. Well I would like to know how to play the clarinet and learn how to play it for many reasons. First, the good thing about about the clarinets is that I like when someone plays the clarinet and it sounds smooth it gives me the chills. Also when they hit a high note on it it gives me chills too. When playing high notes on it it looks easy. Although when playing the clarinet sometimes when I go to a concert there is always at least one person that squeaks when playing it. I tried to play on it once and its hard to play when I try to play it fast. But the worst part when playing the clarinet is chipping the reed, once when you chip it you wont be able to play as good on it. The only reason I want to learn how to play the clarinet is because I like the way it sounds, it sounds to calming and soothing. In order for me to accomplish to play calming and soothing is to practice at least 1 hour everyday . Also my last reason to play the clarinet is because i kind of think that it looks easy to play but I guess that it is a hard instrument to play. These are my reason on why i would want to accomplish and play on the clarinet. ",7,7,6,7,7,8,963,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
64,1384,6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go. In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and theres no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you shouldnt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective dont get involved as much as your other friends is. Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people dont like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials. In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students dont have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. Its just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to Kings Dominion and once your there you well be like Ive earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something thats giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view Im working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do. Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they dont because were a family and something we always say when were down is dream, believe, achieve . This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also youre parents and family . In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you dont have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

65,1947,39929B24673E,"The success is something that everyone gets one day. Some persons dont success, because they maybe dont have the opportunities to success. Others persons dont success because they dont want to success, they dont want to be a impotant person, with a perfect job, or house. Success sometimes have something bad; to get success, in jobs, or in life, people go throw a lot of bad things. I agree with Churchills statement, its a true statement, and so important too. First, people have to have enthusiasm, if people lose enthusiasm they breakdown, they deteriorate. Failure make some people more weak, and others so hard in thinking in perfect things for there life. Failure is something that every person have, or they go throw failure before. People can failure in jobs, people get fire from there jobs they failure. Second, failure plays a amazing role in the pursuit of be better; However, when people failure to much, the perfects things come after. In peolpe life something chance when they go throw to much failure. They think different way, they see the thinks differents. When people failure, they start thinking in different way, because they go from failure to failure. People maybe think that they are not going to be a respect, or a important person, thats why they think like that. However, some people failure a lot of time, but they dont care they try again, and if they failure they try again, they dont stop trying they dont loss enthusiasm. Example: A person go to a school, to find a job like a teacher, he want to be a english teacher, they went to the main office to talk with the principal. She said, "" We dont need a english teacher in this school, we already have one, and he is so amazing in his job."" The teacher went to the other school to find job. He went in, and talk with the principal, she was so nice, and she accepted him in the school as a english teacher. He was so nervous, and so happy to hear what the principal said. He did not loss enthusiasm, the first school he went they tell him that they already have a english teacher, and they dont need another one. The second school accepted him, and now he is a english teacher, because he didnt loss enthusiasm. He failure in the first school, but he success in the other one he went. Last, Some persons are amazing to failure, but others are angry, or sad to failure, there is different types of persons. Some they like to failure, some they dont like to failure. All the persons failure in one time in their life, but they maybe success when they failure. Some success and they dont failure anytime. Enthusiasm is something important that any person have not to loss it. Success is something in your life, but people go throw a lot to get success, they failure and failure, and than get success. Some people dont success, because they dont want or they cant. Once people success, others are going to success too. A person success everyone success. People have to not loss enthusiasm to success. Some people success and dont have failure? Some persons success with not having failure, but later in life failure comes.

66,2773,C2F34D6A76D4,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Although the word failure is the lack of success, is the loss of the ability to work normally. As humans, we all know that sometimes instead of get better in life, we currently loss our capacities to start over and follow what we want for us because as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""do not loss the enthusiasm"". To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?. The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success. For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered. Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure. What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress. For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues. This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand. In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer. I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

Second failure makes us humans learn from our mistakes. we humans are not parfect we all make mistake and learn for it. it like me I am a teenager who cant speak english everwell, whenever I spoke to someone my age thay kept on making fun of me, but I never give up on myseif I know that if I learn from my mistakes I will be better at speaking english. Finally failure make us stronger. in life in other to get what we want we have to go throught failure it teach us to be strong and to nevergive up on yourseif. everyone go through failure for example president Donold Trump in other to be a president he has to go through som failure.

69,1196,AD6986B56719,"Michelangelo once said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If youre setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and youll most likely get no satisfaction out of it. Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that youll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; theyll want a hard working and determined individual. A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car youve always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if youre not getting any of those youre doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person. Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why youre not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person. In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelos statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you cant complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.",8,9,9,9,9,7,2335,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

71,2857,F91EFD0443E6,"Have you ever though of people who use technology has limit their communication to others? Nowadays people who use technology are consistent spending their time on electronic device. Technology has a negative impact on human lives due to their daily routine. The first reason is peoples communication skills will decrease over time. Spending a lot of time on technology without comminicating with others, will affect your communication skills. Therefore, talking to someone who you havent talked with for a while can be awkward. This shows that understanding between two people might have consequence and will be not accurate than it should be. The second reason, people who use electronic device are unlikely aware of the surroundings. For example, people who are walking in street using headset or earbuds on that cover their ears is a bad choice. This shows a sign of danger, because you wont be hearing anything. People who are aware of surrounding are more safe to cross a street and communicate with people who are passing by. This shows a negative effect of people who block their earing has higher chance to get into a accident. Some people say that technology helps them communicate by commenting on a website which is true, but that is not important because the person will be not always active and able to comment back on time, whenever they are on. If you are communicate in person you can read the persons mood. You can get a faster respond than waiting for the person to comment back. In this way is more accurate and able to trust each other more by communicating in person that you have meet or have not meet before. The final reason is library is more accurate than reading books online. For example like reading online recommendation is not always accurate because of the peoples preferance. You can ask the librarian for recommendation and librarian also assist you whenever you need help. You can read on your device but it is limited because of the battery. Unlike books, have no battery which means it doesnt have any limit. This shows reading on books is a better than reading on a device. In conclusion technology had a negative effect on people lives. People should be aware that around them and spend their time in their technology on a necessary way. There should be a limit of how much time you are using on technology. Is better to communicate in person and dont wear anything that cover your ears while talking to someone. This affect our daily lives, so limit the time you use in technology.",7,7,9,6,7,8,3747,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

73,2743,62243789233B,"In todays society, many people agree that having a simple goal and achieving it is better than having a huge goal and failing to achieve it, but i disagree. One of the greatest artists, Michelangelo, said that setting our aim too low and achieving it is a great danger for some of us. He stated this thought because he failed and made mistakes before he was known as a great artist. Michelangelo rather fail by doing something big than his life than doing something small and achieving it. I agree with Michelangelo because you learn from past mistakes, you learn to take risks, and having bigger goals help you improve ones self. Michelangelo is a great artist because of his work, but he learned from his own work to keep moving forward. People can learn from past mistakes by seeing what went wrong and practice doing better at it; for example, in a show called Masterchef, chefs must impress the judges by their skills in cooking but one chef gets eliminated every episode. When a chef gets eliminated their dreams may get crushed, but they had the courage to go on and did their best and can learn what they did wrong. Another example is taking the permit test as a teenager. The permit test is something big for teens since it is something related to their future. When I took the test I was nervous and failed by one question, but i checked the answers I got wrong and studied them a bit more and passed the next time I took it. These examples prove that you have the ability to learn from past mistakes, grow as a person, and that you might have to take risks in doing so. Taking risks are mostly involved in big decisions that involve jobs, education,etc. I believe that taking risks are better than small decisions even if those risks dont turn out the way you wanted them too. In a show called Shark Tank, people come in to persuade investors to invest in their products, but they do not always succeed. The people who do not get investments keep moving forward and take their own risks to get a investor. If you learn to take risks, you later get use to it and you can speak more in front of people and state your opinion. Another example is having a meeting for a job. It is best to have a meeting in person than online because it is not as easy so you get challenged and the person interviewing can know you better and you can most likely get the position. Taking risks can make you a better person as a whole and those mistakes can help you improve. Michelangelo and I agree that having a bigger goal and failing is better than having a small goal and achieving it. Having a bigger goal can increase your confidence and help you put your head in the task you want to overcome. People view their mistakes and overcome it so they can do better next time. Small goals do not involve much effort and work as bigger achievements; by choosing to accomplish a simple task, you as a person may get use to the easy way out and can get lazy over time. Setting a higher aim for yourself is better because you can improve your skills and knowledge. Bigger goals are better because of how much they help you improve. A great artist once said it is great danger setting a small aim for yourself. Setting a bigger aim and failing is best because you learn from your mistakes, you learn to take risks, and bigger goals help improve ones self. Smaller aims are a scapegoat compared to bigger aims because of how much easier they are. It is best to challenge yourself so that you are ready for anything that comes your way. Even if you take the high route and fail, it does not mean you can try again. In conclusion, setting a bigger aim and failing is alright and better than setting a small aim due to it being more easy.",6,7,8,7,8,8,1280,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
74,1386,9145AB74E1DA,"I dont think its a good idea to work from home theyre a lot of kids that would just take advantage from working from home. Kids would rather be at home then have to go to school at seven in the morning. Theyre different kinds of people out there who would stay at home just because they didnt feel like getting up so early in the morning. Other kinds where kids put effort into going to school. I dont think working from home is a good idea for school students. There are some kids that cant really work at school, but then theyre others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later. School may be difficult but thats why we have teacher to help you the staff and your parents they will always be there to help. Even the classes online that you do if you work from home have people to help you if you have any questions or if you just need help. Some people are visual learners like right infront of you thats is why i think kids shouldnt work from their homes. People are different some work better by themselves others work better in a group or with a partner thats is why working in school is the better idea. Im not saying saying it wouldnt benefit the kids who are doing their work online im just saying working in school is easier. Im saying some students wouldnt benefit from working from home they would just sleep instead of work or they would just goof off instead of work. Theyre a lot of reasons is to why I dont think working from home or working online is a good idea. You never know who your going to meet online. Some kids dont have internet access so they wouldnt be to work online and when your at school you have all kinds of resources to help you. My opinion in this is that working at school is better than working at home kids actually have a chance to get stuff done and at home kids would just sleep and not do their school work because well, theyre at home. Learning at school is way more helpful then learning online you always have someone there to help.

75,115,C8EBB096262B,"To Begin with, many student have many excuses to not attend school. Of curse, that we can change this to not be happen anymore. Student may not complete the school if they lose the year. What would happen if student get affected for all student that not attend school? For example, like I seen in me that I have a lot of appointment that is affecting me and my grade. We can not let this happen we need to do many thing in order to not let our child lose. In addition, principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year. First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we dont know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them dont find any solution of their problem. In fact, we dont know what it will happen if we dont give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem. Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in theres no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient. To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away. ",6,4,5,5,4,5,2731,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someones life, and even you never give up, just do you and you will see the result at the end. First of all, Its amazing how much may be done if you always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking to much dont wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain dont feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because hes girlfriend didnt want to with him, for the fact that he only thing he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree. In addition, this is why dont stop doing something. Who knows probably a girl/ guy could fall in love with you, or you could also make people feel strong for whatever situation you could be you will see the result at the end. Keep doing what the people with illness do, never give up, they always have an smile on their face.

I dont know why people dont accomplish something in life. People always says that things happen for a reason. There could be reasons of why things happen or not. In my opinion, people should always by doing something. If people accomplish what they want, then there would not be a purpose. It doesnt matter where we are, we could always be doing something. We could accomplish more by: helping our parents, being active, and helping our community. My first reason, We could be doing something by helping our parents. It would be wonderful if we could help our parents at home, or, most thing may be done at home. Helping them by with laundry and cleaning the rooms, so, they dont be tire that much because they just come from work. Helping them with the chores would be a great choice because they would not be too tired from work. Helping our parents is good because they help us when we were little. By doing the chore is our responsibly because they could be mad. My second reason, helping our community. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash so it doesnt pollute the our where we live. Helping other people good or bad. Some people could rape you or stole the money you have in your wallet. It depends of the people some people could be hypocrite and some people could be nice. The most important thing is help our community by pick up trash and cleaning the community. Our free time we could be helping the community so it doesnt pollute like other countries. My last reason, being active anywhere we are. our health is important because if we dont care about our health, we could get disease. Doing one hour of exercise, workout, or something it could be good for our health. By always doing something our health could be healthy, and eat a good diet. Some of the disease are cholesterol, diabetes, and are other more disease if you dont eat healthy or you not do exercise. Being active is very important for you and other people. Helping your parents is a great option because most things could be done. Helping the community is a great choice because we could pick up trash, so the community doesnt pollute where we live. Being active is very important because of your health. Your health is very important because you need to eat right and do exercise or workout.

He went out in public and did these prank that inspired me to try them. My first prank I did was on my family by putting a woppie cushion on they seat it was fun and it made me laugh. I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas. My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks. my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off Amazon and at 5 Below.

81,813,2C9EA803FF3A,"Success comes from failure and failure occurs when something doesnt happen. As I think and based on my experience I am agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, because when someone dont do anything they will never get to the success and cant achieve any skills, so its important to mastered and have skills in your life. everyone should have skills in more than one because life is hard and without trying more it will become more harder. As Emerson says: ""you will never grow"" it means that no succeed is possible without skills in different things. If someone doesnt know anything without their profession in daily life, what do you think will it be easy for him to live like that? Off course not, because life need everything and we will face hardships too and for being successful in our life we have to know everything and try everything beside that we have mastered. For example: someone has skills in engineering but they dont get any job and he want to start his personal business in which he doesnt have any skills, we know that it will be difficult for him to start because he doesnt know anything about business, so if he try and make a way for his business then he will get skills. Our skills in more then one profession make us famous and shows our personality to other people and makes us more responsible in our life. Getting mastered in more then one will make you famous and successful. Life does not remain in one situation and life is going to change in every second. Also humans are not same as well because everyone is getting older day by day so who knows what will happen next without Allah. For example: Everyone of us need to do different tasks and get our skills but beside that our life also need skills for our future generation and it is very important for every human being to have skills in their life because they have to show the right and wrong ways to their children. If you are a skillful person then everyone will want to meet you because everyone need to know from the person who is mastered and you will become famous and fame is the way to success and without trying noting success is way too much hard. Knowledge doesnt ends because its like a sea and sea doesnt stop. All of human beings needs to learn and they must learn. knowledge is not just a book and a school that we do in daily life. For example: We cant achieve more skills from our books but we can be mastered if we try different from the book and try something new. If we just try and learn from our books then it will be too much harder to achieve everythings skills from reading book beside reading we have to work and search for it and again trying is best option for success and growth. We know that knowledge is more important then everything else but also without skill even knowledge is nothing. If we dont have skills then we dont know how to use our knowledge and our skills comes from doing different tasks and without trying something different success is hard and growth of mind is impossible. I am agree with Emerson and what does he says is based on his experience and if we think of those things then we can find the right answer. As I mentioned life is hard and our life need more skills to go further and getting mastered in more then one profession will make us famous and successful in our further life and being famous and successful needs more hard work to try different from what we already know. Work hard, be active and dont fear because time doesnt wait and our growth of mind and success comes from try different and hard in our life.",7,7,6,7,5,6,592,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

First, working in groups is better because we get extra help from classmates. For example, we divide the assignment with our classmates.

First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we dont take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we dont gonna know how much can be done if we dont try to do the things that we wants or needs to done. Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives.

86,435,34A066E69905,"There are two types of working. one of them is workinng with a group, another one is working individually. Although some people prefer to work alone. I belive it is so much better to work in a group. If we compare these two working types, the benefits of group work are more then those working alone. Firstly, I prefer to work in a group because group work allow a person to work according to his or her strength, since the the group members apply their strong side to the work, the completion time will be faster. For instance, I was involve in a car desgin project several years ago. one person made engineering calculation to understand which parts are critical for our design, I made the drawings of the car components, and another friend of mine made the presentation for our project, then he present it to the teacher, He gave us a good respond and additional points since we completed our work before the due date. to be more precise, we did a great job, because we devided the work according to our strong sides. Another reason why I prefer to work an a group is that I think that this type of work establishes a stonger relationship between the group members. As humans, sociallzation it important for us and working with a group give us a chance to improve our relationship. when people are in a group, they have to communicate with each other at each step of the process. for example, in our last year elective course, I made new friends becaude we were involved in a group project together. Thankds to the project, we did build a great relationship among each other, and we are still in touch. lastly, group work improves the sense of responsibility. All group members are aware that their perperformance effects the group, so all group members try to do their best and work hard to get better results. For example, A few years ago, some of my friends and I participated in a competition which was related to optimization. since there was a lot of thing to do, we devide the topics among each other. we did not have enough information about one of the shared parts. however, a person who got that subject made a lot of effort to learn the topic well. He attended online course and read books related to that field. Eventualy, he accomplished it and did a great job. what Im trying to say is that in a group work, even if a person does not have enought information related to his or her working area, he or she may learn things with his or her effort becuse he or she knows that a miskake will cause negative outcomes. In conclusion, working with a gruop makes things more easier and helps make the group member work more happily. If we take the info account to all these factors, we may reach the conclousion that working in a group has more advantages than working alone.",7,7,7,7,7,6,685,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

The more work you get done during summer it counts your GPA scores. Doing everything done with work at school can get ready for everything to be done. Do students do online classes and night school right now? If so, how do students get it done with all the activity and what programs they do to make it done. Some school offer programs for students to help them with there grading and work they make during the past school year. I remember all the year that I did all my best for high school Ive done after school tutoring and morning tutoring to just get everything done so I can just graduate and help my family. This oppoturniy graduating early helps me get ready for school. Classes in school is hard because they helping you out to get ready for college, because when you enter college its very different than in high school because all the oppotunity you can make for your self. Being orgizinize with all the work you do in school can help you with all the work you will do in college this is you being independent for everything you do in high school because teachers helping you out. For me being a high school students all the elective classes I do helps me with the course Im taking in college and doin online classes was the best way to get it done. Programs you make in school and trying to be in it will help you with all the work you have. Early gradutes, yes, theres alot of them in the country to just get there education done with everything. Colleges do look at your scores and work you do with all the information you do in school all the records and everything. Having good grades and always in school thats one of the records to make college look at you and be like I want her to know to be in my college. I will say that offer programs from different school you can get accept with all this around you because this can help you out with all the career you do in high school. Graduating three years instead of four years you can get everything done. Thats why students graduate early.

89,2945,76E5D0DEC30A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. There is a quote that says, ""If you want to go fast go by yourself, but if you want to far go with someone else"". As the quote says, I think that its very important to have someone to guide us throughout the course of our lives. I agree that seeking for guidance from experts to make wise decisions can have a great impact in our lives. Experts and authorities can provide us with advices to make good decisions in life and accomplish our goals more easily. First of all, having someone to guide you throughout the decisions you make in life could help you accomplish a goal a lot easier. For example, when I was in middle school I used to think that doing individual work was faster and easier. However, I noticed that most of my classmates who worked in groups finished all the assignments in less time than I did. This experience showed me the importance of always having someone to give you their opinion to accomplish a goal quickly and avoid wasting your time. Thus, seeking for guidance from experts can help you achieve any goal you set in life and avoid wastig your time on making wrong decisions. In addition, you will learn and gain experience if you have someone expert to guide you. For example, having an expert guiding you will allow you to see his different points of view and learned from his teachings. This will allow you to learn from his teachings and experiences and reflect about them. Furthermore, relying on with an expert will give you the chance to learn new lessons and in the future give you the opportunity to make your own decisions. Finally, you will learn how to make wise choices by learning from the lessons that an expert or authority could offer you. Some people say that having someone telling you what to do will limit you from choosing whats best for you. For instance, when I was 10 years old I really wanted to make my own decisions that I thought were best for me. In whatever manner, I rarely got to choose my own decisions because my brother was always there telling what decisions to make. As I grew older I understood that my brother was just guiding me through the right path. Because my brother had experienced many of the situations I went through, he was able to help me and in many occasions avoid me from failing. Therefore, experts and authorities will be there to not let you fail and always look for whats best for you. In conclusion, seeking from guidance from experts may not give you the freedom to make your own decisions, but it will help you accomplish your goals rapidly and efficiently. Since experts have already experienced many rough situations in life, they will know how to make decisions that will benefit us in the best way. Furthermore, in the course of the path with an expert guiding you, you will learn a lot of things that will help you make better choices. Finally, you will avoid wasting a lot of your lifes time trying to follow your own instincts and ideas.

A way of having a good attitude is by seeing things n the bright side of things, even though its bad. Another reason why having a good attitude is important, is because people appreciate when someone gives them a good feeling either their sad or mad. Another reason why its important to have a good attitude is becasue you get things done properly, for an example, when you have to do a project due in two days you take your time and dont rush, you do things with a good attitude. If not your project will be at the end a mess, and youre going to be frusterated. Having a good atitude is impotant because, you can help other when theyre going trough tough times, for an example, whn my mom was sick and she was dealing with asma, we had to take her to the ER mant times. It was sad for me to see her all sick, not only that but she was pregnat and couldnrt anything because she had acid reflux. So whenever she felt sad and stressed out, I knew I had to support her and have a good attitude. By having a good attitude I had to help her with some house hold things because she couldnt really do anything. Another reason of having a good attitude is by also having a good mindset, because when you have a good minset you can go through your tough times easly. And when you are stresse out abput something you have to have a good minset and a good attitude. For an example when I had to deal with by spine problembecause my disk was moved,I had to hae a good attitude because if I am ther complaining about my pain, its not going to help me. So if I just relax and take rest and tak my medications then I will have a good attitude, because I know that everything will be okay. So this is why having a good attitude is very helpful, because you can help others when they are going through tough times, or whenever you and I are going through tough times, and how it helps you succed in things.",6,7,7,6,7,6,3308,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

I think young students should not commit to a career yet because their minds can change at any momment and if they commit to a career and if they start to not like the career they wanted they will wasted all their time and effert to that one career. Also, If the classs for the career are defficult they and they give up halfway and drop out the class and never try again. So their goal to get the career they want is not in reach for them anymore. Also, you may still not be ready to commit to a career because there are different things you may be into and like doing more then the job you want to do. However, some people may not feel the same way as me on this topic. people may think that is a good idea that young student commit to a career because they have an idea of what they want to do later in life and wont be stuck as may other students may be. I still think at students that are young should not commit to a career yet. so For my conclusion if you are in high school and if you dont know if you want to commit to a specific career dont because you can chage youre mind at anytime.

92,2068,24C508ED6FE2,"It is true that there are many ways to influence others. Its not your behavior that defines your actions. Its how you show people by your actions, having goals and to have motivation to be able to influence others. Sometimes you dont even have to be positive to be able to influence others. For example, in the movie ""The Princess and The Frog"" , she wanted to open a restaurant because it was her dads dream. So she kept working to get enough money to pay for a building she wanted. She didnt get it in the beginning, but at the end of the movie she did. What im trying to say is that she had one goal and it was to open a restaurant. she also had motivation to keep working to earn enough money to do so. For my first reason why you can influence others in different ways is by your actions. The best way someone can influence others is by your actions. For example lets say you help out by donating food to your local food bank. That wont make much difference but if you do it daily, word will eventually get out on how you kept donating food for people in need. Especially if it gets on the news about the good deed you did, then more people would donate more to help out their community. For my second reason why you can influence people in different ways is by having goals. Many people whit goals accomplish more that people without one. For example lets say that your trying to save money to buy a new game that coast eighty dollars. But you dont have any money left. So you do chores like cleaning, washing your parents car, or cutting the grass. You still dont have enough. So you start going to your neighbors house and asking if they need anything done. Eventually you earn just the right amount to buy the new game. Basically, if you want something set goals and accomplish them to earn what you want. For my last reason why you can influence people in different ways is by being motivated. You cant influence others if your down. You have to try being inspiring and energetic. Because if others see you being motivated they would most likely do the same. Being motivated is important because it shows purpose of completing a goal. It also shows how hard you are willing to work to accomplish something. some people may say that,a persons behavior is the best way to influence others because it sets the right mood on someone to be motivated. But on the other hand behavior doesnt show how a person can be influence to do something. Therefor the best way to influence people is by showing them your actions, goals, and being motivated.

I was a clear example of this situation, last year I take an online course and of course it benefit my self a lot. How I get benefit: well first I pass the class that I was needing. It makes you feel more comfortable, because youre attending to class from home. It is more flexible, what I means with flexible you have more time to work in other things, also you have the option to turn in the homework a little later, one last thing you administer you time whatever you like.

If some student ask me I obviously recommend them to take online classes, it is a good way to improve your weakness and also you are going to be more success.

My opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always rremember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didnt do homework club I would sometimes miss fun friday because during fun friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up.

95,56,506A69171959,"Do you have a goal in your life? How can you accomplish to your goal? I think everyone can get a goal, but many people ask, ""how can I get a goal?"" Because they cannot wait until the finish goal line, also they cannot concentrate on their goal. We cannot see the finish line,that is why people always give up in fort of the finish line you are always doing something, then you can do accomplish more. This is three reasons you can do accomplish more if you are always doing something. First is when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Concentrate power is amazing, Every history of the scientists were concentrate one thing and always do something. For example, have you seen the Newtons notes? He always thought and concentrated to gravity and earth. He took notes every seconds and minutes, he never stopped take notes. Today, we learning his notes everyday like Newtons first law, second law, and third law. If you think about it and concentrate one thing, you can closer to your goal. Second, If you keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. For example, David in the Bible, he practiced throw the stone everyday. He never forgot to practice throw the stone, and one day he met an enemy. Everyone thought David will die because David was so small and young, but the enemy was really big and strong. Do you know the end of story? David won the battle because of the stone, he attacked enemys head. what is the main idea of this story? Throw the stone is really small and tiny thing, but he attacked enemy and saved the nation. If you keep going on any small thing and tiny thing, you can make it and you can make more biggest thing, you could not imagine thing. Third, you keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. Keep trying and keep dreaming are really important. If you dont have dream in your life, you can never get that. For example, Aristotle was experiment everyday. Also the result was different everyday, but he keep trying figure out the result. If you gave up that time and stopped challenge, then maybe we dont know who is the Aristotle. Many scientists also said this, keep dreaming is better than not dreaming. Keep dreaming and get more closer to your goal in your dream, get a hope and keep challenge. Finally, when you concentrate on one thing and think about that, then you can get a power to get in your goal. Becuase the concentrate power is amazing. Do not give up and keep going to your goal, you can get into the summit. Whenever you are and whatever you want, if trying to do that, you can make it. You keep dreaming and keep trying to your goal you can get the accomplish to your goal. If you want to something to do and something to accomplish, you have to know what is my goal and what should I do for my goal.

Teachers and students should start meeting after school this idea would benefit students by getting extra support, turning assignments on time get a better understanding of the things that the teacher teach on class, establishing the club would help those students who dont turn in assignments on time or those who like to do things early. In order to students to be successful they need extra support a better explanation of the things they learn, many students struggle with the assignments and most of them dont ask for support through the school year I have seen many students raping the assignments because they dont understand them, but if the school make the the idea of starting a club there would be no excuse for students to not be successful in their homework, tests, and class assignments. Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who dont turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they dont understand the assignments and if someone dont understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students. In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students dont care about school because they dont find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they dont understand. In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you dont understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",6,6,6,5,5,6,1633,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families.

Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom. One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school.

To be yourself in this actual world its difficult for some people because sometimes they dont support the judges from other people and most of this people just decide to end with their life. For example the LGBT community get a lot of hate, judge and bad things from other people that is not part of it. People in this world just talk about others without thinking the pain that they can cause by saying just a few simple words. Other example is the people from other country that travel to another, there are people that are racist and make people feel that they are from another world, when they are actually they same, the only thing that change is the culture and language. To be yourself in a world that is contantly trying to make you something else is one of the most important things that people have to achieve, to live the life better because you will never progress in your emotional life if you dont make people accept the way that you are.

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on peoples lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans. Although some people says that technology had positive effects on peoples lives, actually technology can have negative effects on peoples lives because technology cause addiction to peoples. Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesnt cause negative effects on peoples lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on peoples lives. First reason, why does technology had negative effects on peoples lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology . Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents. The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on peoples lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They cant stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.

105,1772,16005A45A20A,"Theres 90% of people in the world that wants to be someone in life, but some people never had the chance or some people just gave up on school,and now they regret it. In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that thats not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we dont do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if its really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in. I want to be able to see if the career I want to take its really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldnt just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasnt really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldnt do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever theres a problem with my moms car or my dads car, we go to him. This is what Im talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I dont want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me. If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career Im interested in. It does not only help me to see if Its really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didnt know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, Im attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because Ive heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because thats what he is, but I told him that wasnt really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldnt be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since hes the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friends house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me. There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so Ill just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you dont like the job you are doing everyday, then you wont ever be happy with what you are doing. Thats why you have to find a job thats really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people thats going to need your help. This is why its important to know what you really want for yourself. I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision. Like I said before, if Its not what I want, then thats okay because Ive learned new things that will always help me in life. If its not for me, then theres always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know theres more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. Its not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out. I want an opportunity to see what I really want. ",8,6,6,6,7,7,300,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

First students can have more time to learn. For example, in a year students can learn much stuff, and they have energy to learn, in the summer students just have two months to study, so they dont have much time to learn all the stuff they learn at school, in evenings students have three months to study, the classes start a 5pm and end at 7pm, so at that time students are tired and the dont have much energy, so its difficult to concentrated and learn all the stuff.

Beside that, they also need to release stressful after two or three hours from studying. Its a good condition for students to recharge and heighten their energy for the next efficient block when they take the classes of art but it wastes time for students who wont spend time to practice it. Today, studying in high school, which turns to boring with almost students because they cant locate where they are, what they are interested in at school. In that case, finding the funny things, which is the best way to counter that situation, is helping us to reduce stressful and recharge us from hold blocks study. For example, there are multiple choices for us like enrolling a band, joining a drama, taking part in an art class for making motivation in studying . We must be required to take those classes because that also is what we choose. Beside that, choosing to sign up an art class are not only helping students to clean up their brain, which become easily to adopt information from the following block, but also increase efficient- adoption. For instance, after a serious block with full information in our brain, we must to clean it up by singing, acting or drawing class, it will help our brain feel relaxing and ready for adopting more information. It also depends on our type of favorite in entertainment that your body and brain can feeling relax when we are into it. We agree that every students should be required to take those classes but if such classes wont be electives to select students natural abilities; a huge students, who arent serious about a music, a drama, an art class, will make other students feel uncomfortable. Like they are going to sleep or make noise which effect to everybody around to enjoy their fresh time. To sum up, we know students should take a class from arts to make them feel fresh after a tired day or two to three blocks in a row to recharge and make our adoptive abilities improving; it help students produce motivation from school and make them feel comfortable without pressure. But classes of art still need to be electives to choose which students own availability to take part in that class to make sure they dont waste time in the block they even arent interested in.

108,1162,85F4C57672EA,"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didnt do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home. Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You cant control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. Thats why you cant predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isnt good. Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If youre sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didnt understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you cant do it because youre at home and nobody can explain the material you dont understand. Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. Youre free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time. You be able to kill two birds on the same shot. To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. Thats why i would never change them for one computer at home.

110,1978,163AC455E1DF,"In my opinion i think online schooling wont benefit any student because, you dont have a teacher in front of you explaining what to do. Video conferencing is something different, you basically at school but on a screen. Youll be able to hear the teacher while shes explaining the assignment and teach it to you better so that way you understand more and you can be able to ask questions. Looking at a screen and reading an assignment isnt going to help you much. If you have an actual teacher, she/he goes into details and shows you examples of how to do an assignment. Being home schooled is pretty challenging. Most online schooled kids tend to procrastinate and end up falling behind. Most shy kids are home schooled or video conferencing because of problems or any other thing thats going on with them. If students want to attend online and video conferencing, then thats fine as long as their getting their education and finishing their assignments. Its the law for every student to go to school or to do something thats related to school. Online classes are pretty expensive to pay up, so students must complete their assignments because theyll charge you for it either way. I think attending school would be better. Teachers teach you better and help you out when you dont understand something. You get less homework and maybe even easier homework to do. You dont need to pay anything for your child to go to a public school. Your student gets taught well. So in that case i think going to school is better then online class and video conferencing.

My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas . Examples: If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online. If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class. With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home . If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time . Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it s not easy . I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing. One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace . My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult . My reference is the option class FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptops , computers , gaming systems and their smart tvs. Now with this new technology the school systems have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes. Some would say that online classes would not benefit students id say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefits way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free shed finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when shed finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together. The people that say that online classes arent beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes wont have to worry about those issuses. Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention. Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free. Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students 8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house. In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples ive given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. Ive given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell.",7,6,6,7,6,6,573,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
115,2039,9E49399B42B4,"Some people belive that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art clases. Should students be required to take a class in arts, or should such clases be electives? I belive that students should be require to take these clases because it plays a great rolls in our lives. students should take these clases because theyre part of our daily activity. Some students are really good at arts, and some are good at music, while the others are good at drama. So such clases should be allowed in schools for students to take. I also agree with those that says that students should be required to take clases like art, music, and drama because some students wants to become an artistic, some wants to become a musician, while the others want to be a dramatist, so it should be allowed in school for students to take them. I believe that through arts and music, or even a drama, people are able to express their emotional feelings, or their passed lives. As for me music and art should really be allowed in schools because through those subjects people will be able to express their grievances. Some people may say these clases should not be require for students to take and such clases should be electives because not evryone are good at them. Well its true, but these clases are really helpful to the society because not everyone have the face or the abilies to really express their emotional feelings to peolpe, however, people have their passed life stories to tell, but they dont know how to let them out. Probaly through arts, music, or even drama theyll be able to express them out to the world. Through this subjects many people are rich today, and many people was able to let what had been in them for years upon years out, so they should be required for students. For instance: Beyounce, Rehanna, Nici and so on. I believe those people didnt just come up to become rich today they study music because that was their goals in life. In summary, music, arts, and drama should be required for students to take, and such clases shouldnt be electives in school or for students.",7,7,6,5,5,6,2110,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

First, when you meet someone and you see how they act you get those feelings about them if it was hate or love. Second, you may never meet that person agean, so the way he act this one time is gong to make you judge them. Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions. Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act. For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life.

119,2922,8A4D99910F10,"Students will struggle to learn the subjects that the school requires them to take such as History, Math, Science, and English. Attending to school can have a huge impact in your life. How would it affect you, if you dont atten to school?. would it be the same if you learn all the materials by watching videos?. would you be able to ask questions just the same way other students do?. Making a decision of taking class from home can make a huge impact in your life and the future. For example a high schooler that takes classes online that wants to be a history teacher they can struggle a lot because a video cant give you enough information, for you to know the story. a video only summarize the story comapring to when youre in class you can ask questions and also have more information from your teacher. Having a teacher explalining you everything and working with other students can help your grade and also your GPA for you to attened to good collages and be able to have a lot of advantages. Students will have more benefits and advantages of learning the materials, if they atten to school. students will also have good grades and apportunities for them to get a scholarship and have a higher GPA that would help them attened the collage they want to go to. For example if students dont have a high GPA, the most common thing that would happen would be that they will be rejected by a lot of collages. Having a high GPA can help you get into good collages without having to pay and you can also earn money while youre attending collage. students will be able to graduate early from collage and with a really high degree that could benefit them by finding job where they start at the top like others professionals people. Students will struggle a lot looking for collages that are not too expensive or collages that can help them save money. For example nova is an academic instutude collage that has a lot of benifits for students such as saving money for collage. Have apportunities of going to others university or instutudes where you can work as an asisting and get well paid. Nova can be very helpful institutude that students can attened to because they only attened to nova for two years. At nova they prepare students to when they are ready to move on to a four year collage but you need to have a good GPA and have all the requirements that nova asks for. However not everyone agrees that atteneding to school is benificial for students. some students think that having to show up to school is a waste of time and that it would be better if they learn by looking tutorials on youtube or being able to attend classes from home. For example if students dont attened to school they wont be able to understand anything which it will cause them to stress out and make them give up on there dreams. students wont adchieve if we let them attend classes from home. Students also dont agree about having good grades and a good GPA. For example students think that they can still go to the collages they want to attened without matter of there grades and GPA that all they had to do is pay. but the question is ""do you have the money to pay collage?"".

120,623,F66B2BAB7E4C,"Do we choose our own behavior or is it controlled by other influences. Well it all has to depend on the type of person you are. For example if you are somebody who gets influenced by other people then you are going to act like those people. And usually those people are bad influences, but if you are somebody that chooses to be who they are then that is really who they are. And mostly it is to be nice to others, and those are some reasons why it can go either way, but for me i personally think you have a choice to be who you desire to be without any influeces. When you get to be who you want to be life is easier. You are going to be true to yourself and people will have respect for you. And many people all over the world are scared to be themselfs, and would rather get controlled by other people. And because of those type of people they spread that nagative influence off to other people that get controlled easily. But in the end it depends on who you hang around with. Choosing the way you act is very important not just for you but for your future. Because your future is what matters at the end of the day. And because of that reason is because if you want to find a good job you have to be respectful and kind. But if you didnt have a good attitude then nobody wont hire you. Its reasonable too, because nobody wants a bad attitude person in their jobs. Many people who have chose their characters have been successful because of it. And cause they have confedenced they can achieve anything they want in the world. And all that just because they went on to be themselfs. Meanwhile those who have been influenced by others have been stuck like that their whole lifes. Depending on what type of influences they get, because some are good and they get to high places in life. So at the end of the day as long as you choose something that is good for you and wont take you to bad places you will be great in life. But unfortunally it usually ends in bad places for those who are weak and would rather take influences by others who are in bad situations. And thats why for me it is better to choose to be yourself then to follow others. But if you are somebody that likes the influences then choose people who are good. That is how i see it in my eyes.

We have to do something always everywhere in the world even in the bad times of ours life time. For example we have to work, take cares of our childrens and also ours country. As we born and grow up we have the right to work harder at school until we finish than we have to work. we always have to work in untied state because we have a lot of bills every month in the Mali box everyday a bill is coming from different companies, Every month the rent of the house. Than the rent of the cars we drive. And the insurance of the cars. The bills from gas and water so from every where. We work this much money and we pay back more than we make and at the end nothing will left for us. Than we have to take cares of the kids always something new when ever they see something we have to buy it to them no matter what you cant say no we have to work so that we can take cares of them anytime anywhere. Unit they grow up they always asking for milk if the government dont give the families or the kids the snap which is a card they always or each month they sent money into the card so you buy food from it and thats for kids. If they dont help people and the people have to work even at night to prevent every things for their kids. We always have to do something for our country to do our jobs like we have to work hard to protect the people from dying we have to take cares of our jobs better. We have to help the government by paying taxis so they can do something to the country make the roads safer for us so we can drive in a better roads. We always have to do something that the people whos lives in the country proud of us such as the police mans, military and air forces or anything else who ever work they should be honest with their work. That way we can do something for the country. In conclusion we always have time to work its never late if we want work or do something and instead of staying home is better if we work outside.

122,550,F93A5B7E57AF,"Being ourselves in a world strongly influenced,manipulated,and corrupted by people. Make a big difference in our lives .This also make us to know, who we are. Because we should not change our personality,our cultures,and how we were educated. Although being like other people make us to socialize easily. Nevertheless, we should not change our personalities. Because our personality is what help us to become our dreams in reality. For example there is a case of two guys who were twins one of them was nice all the time, and the other rude because he was influenced by his friends all the time having even a weird personality, that nobody liked. They attended to the same school their last year in high school, the one who was rude had many problems and one of those problems took him to death, however, his brother who was upset by his death, never stopped being a nice guy and having a great personality,he graduated from high school and attended to one of the best universities in the United States. Additonally having a real personality without any change help us to be more honest with ourselves. I remember last year in my math class my teacher told us to check our assigment by ourselves. In the honor system and I only got six of the ten questions right which was a sixty percent I told her the true and after she checked she gave points extra, she said that I deserved for being honest. In fact our personality gaves us an attitude and help us to be honest with ourselves. Another important reasons for which we should keep being ourselves is because we should not lose our culture. Because our culture makes us special and different to the rest. For example there is a story of a girl who moved from Colombia to Canada where she always practiced her culture even made a club with her traditions that colombian people in Canada visited,so she became famous really fast and made a lot of money. Additionally it is important to keep our culture in anywhere because the culture is an important legacy that children adapt from their parents. One amazing example of this is Leonel Messy a great soccer player, from Argentina, who has been living in Spain for a long time. However he is still practicing his culture and does not change his accent thanks to his family which made him to beloved by all Latin America. Therefore keeping practice our cultures will make our families, and others to be proud of us Also it is important to be ourselves, to show how we were educated. Due to our education is what define by itself how we threat other people. For example on the newspaper was written a story of a guy who teached a long time ago English to his students in a particular way giving them candies when they participated,he never changed his method and all his students got good scores always. Actually our education is most the most need in our life. For example my uncle graduated from high school and ten years after that. He attended to college and the university where he studied languages now he has a family an really good life,but he never stopped being the nice man he was and still being today. in conclusion,we must continue to be ourselves in anywhere, anytime to have a real and nice personality. That will open doors to become our dreams true. Also to keep our culture alive for the next generations. Making our families proud of ourselves. Finally it is important to be ourselves because it shows the way we were educated. Because a good education brings a good life. Therefore being ourselves bring so much good things to our life, that we should not change by the influence of other people.

123,1988,52F9582F9C86,"Every student should have the opportunity to be involved in extracurricular activities for them to enrich their educational experiences. Here are some reasons why they should be involved in activities, when theyre involved in activities they have the opportunity to do different kind of stuff outside home, school, and even work. They also learn how to be independent and responsible. Also being in extracurricular activities could also help the students health. First, when students are involved in activities outside school and home, it gives them the chance to experience different things outside school, home, or even work. They learn different kind of things. Things they wouldnt learn in school. For example during school they learn about math, science, history, and english. When theyre home they do nothing but homework and help around the house some students have to work. If theyre involved in activities, they have the opportunity to experience different kind of stuff for example: if a student decided to do a sport they would learn about that certain sport and they would also play it and enjoy it with a team. If they play a sport they would have to also practice at home, but not verse others or be in a team to practice with. Second, students learn how to be more independent when involved in activities. For example, when I decided to join figure skating I wasnt independent, I didnt really know how to do things by myself, and when I joined at first it was kind of hard because I needed help with everything but as time passed by I started to learn how to be more dependent. I started doing almost everything by myself without any help, I was more dependent at home, school, and figured skating. Being involved in this activity, also taught me how to be more responsible. When doing activities you need to learn how to use your time wisely because you will need time for school, homework, family, and the activity youre involved in. Being involved in an activity is a good way to learn how to be responsible, how to be independent, and how to manage your time wisely. Last, joining an activity can help with your mental and physical health specially if its a sport. Joining an activity is a good way to distract yourself from school, home, or work. This is because you will be thinking about the rules of the activity or about the point of that certain activity. It also helps your physical help meaning that it helps you exercise and it helps your body do what it needs to do. Being involved in a sport is a good way to help you exercise and distract yourself from other things. Being involved in activities such as sports or school clubs allows you to enjoy that time. If its something you really like then its something you can look forward to after having a bad day or a stressful day. When I had a bad day I would always think about skating and what I should do to make my jumps better. I would also go to the skating ring and practice, this helped me be more active and helped my physical health too. Being involved in a sport or any other activities is a good way to help students look forward for things. Some people may argue that schools should control student involvement in extracurricular activities because some students dont have time to do school assignments but that shouldnt be their problem, that would be the students problem because students should know that if they join more than one activity they will still need to do school assignments such as homework or projects. Students should learn how to manage their time and use it wisely. Students and families should control the student involvement in extracurricular activities.",8,7,8,8,8,7,1085,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
124,22,E52ADC86DFFC,"Based on my experiences i would say that is not true because people always can change. Im my opinion i think people say that because with the person that they are talking to or they are meeting does not show interest on them. The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change. One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment. If i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend. The first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer. To conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3305,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
125,1813,F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages. First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school. second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students dont work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear. In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day. Obviously, its probable that students feel more easy in this way, for making their homework with time, wisdom, and decoration.

First: Students who live far away will get tired. these students will not have enough time to do their homework because of the time they spend in their journey back to home. This may be a problem for the students who want to stay after school. they will be not able to do it because of the time. In my case im tired because I dont have the enough time to sleep. scientist say that students might sleep for nine hours, but I cant because of the time I spend working after school. Second: These new changes will bring problems for the students who work after school. They may lose their jobs because they cant be on time. The students who live by their own will not have the money to pay for the things they need in order to graduate. 50% is the percentage of students, who work after school and they will get in serious problems if the school makes these changes. They will get bad grades, tired, and also this can make a person to think about doing bad things such as robbery or drugs. Finally; These students will not have the time to spend with their parents. parents enjoy spending their free time in the afternoon, but this is a problem because of the four days of school. student do not have the time for their parents, because they arrive home late. these students will feel they are alone without any support. because os the amount of time the have with their families. Some students say it is a great idea to change to a four days of school. but they are wrong because of the students who live far away, it will be hard to finish their studies.

127,472,3AFA78FFFC15,So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that wouldnt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people wouldnt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport. Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too. Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives shouldnt be lazy because that wouldnt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason. Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. wont have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time youll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play. Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life isnt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment.

Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that. Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening. With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs. Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.",6,5,7,7,7,7,1416,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
130,1362,245B5CD11772,"I beleive that if somebody wants to have succes there will always be some failure. The most important thing is that the person dosent lose there confidence or entusiasm. Ive also been through that to where I want to succead at something that I want to achieve and theres failure down the road. Once I failed I told myself to be positve about it and not just give up or get stressed about it and know that I needed to work harder at it. There are people who want to have succes but forget that its not that easy. People have to remember that it takes time and to have patience,and stay positive. Its not easy because that person has to work hard and show effort but even after showing and doing all those things there still can be failure. When somebody fails its better to think about what can be down next time and to try harder after the first try. Anybody could lose confidence or the energy after they keep failing but he or she forgets to see what can be down better next time. After that to check what has gone wrong and not lose confidence because eveybody has the potential to do anythung. Failure will always be there but it plays an important role for that person to remember that nobodys perfect and that theres always mistakes. The important part is to keep trying and to fix that mistake and to keep that energy up and confidence that it can be done its mot impossible. Ive also been through this to where i have a big dream and i chase after it and I think its easy but then i realized it was starting to get harder. After i tried so hard to keep working and trying i lost confidence after i kept failing again,and again. Its better to stay positive because people might say that i cant do it or many things that can cause me to lose confidence. But i choose to stay posive because i realized nobody is perfect even artist,singers,and many other things that people wanted to be because they also had mistakes and had to try harder next time. I realized after failing there were improvements better then the last time i tried and it kept happining becuase i tried harder each time but eventually i got there. Its best to know that in order to have success theres failure but it has to movitate to try harder next time and then eventually when someone works hard enough they have success.

131,2572,B312F104B015,"I agree that the option the some schools are offering is very beneficial for students, which is the distance learning option. Distance learning is being explained in the prompt it says ""distance learning is an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing"". I think that this option that some schools offer to their students benefits them in many ways. For example the food and transportation are tow big things that some students worry about. This essay will contain the benefits that this option will provide and some of them might apply to you Some benefits that students will have being in this program are the food and transportation. Lets say that a middle school students always have problems with transportation because their parents work and he have to wait thirty minutes after school everyday, in this case this option that the school offers will be beneficial for him. Another thing is the food. There are some students that do not like food from school some of them bring their own food but some of them opt for not eating anything the whole day. Last year I had a friends that never ate at school because they did not like the food. This option will be beneficial for students like my friends because when you take classes from your own home your are not force to eat something you really do not want. The benefits that you get does not end there. We all as student had struggle at least once trying to find what cloth to use the next day and if you do not find what you are looking for you might have to go out and wash cloth or use for second time and no body likes that. Well taking this option that the school offers you will not have to worry about that and you can use the same cloth you had when you woke up in the morning. Another thing are the uniforms because not every school let you use the cloth you want. When a school require uniforms you have to use it like or not. By taking the option that the school offers you benefits you in the way because buying a required uniform that you do not want is a waste of money that could have being wasted in cloth that will really going to use. This where tow more benefits that might apply to you. There still one more benefit and is the liberty to choose whether to do things or not because of the free time you will have by taking this option. Like for example lets say that you are in high school and you like sports but you want to work you will have to choose one of them because school consume a lot of time. In my case I am a senior now and I stopped to play basketball which is my favorite sports to start working because being in school take a lot of time. Taking classes at home take less time than being in school and you could do both things if you want to which are to work, sports or just to do whatever thing you want to do. Concluding my response regarding to this topic my thoughts are that this option benefits students in many ways. By taking this option you will not have to worry anymore of transportation, food, or making the things you like the most. Like for example you do not have to decide whether to practice your favorite sport or having a job. As you can see above I talk about some benefits that you should consider by taking this option and that might apply for some students.

132,155,01A65BA4080E,"Most schools let students use their cell phones during class for educational purposes, however, other schools dont think that allowing students to use their cell phones would be better than using computers in the library or computer labs, by allowing students to use their phones there will be a higher chance for them to get distracted doing what they are not supposed to intead of doing their assignments. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers. Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and its made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers. By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well. If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesnt mean that every student has to use their phones too. Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers. By allowing us students to use our cell phones its only increasing our chances to get distracted and it would make our grades drop. If we were aloud to use our cell phones during school we would not pay attention to our teachers and we would never get our work done. Us students should not be aloud to use our cell phones during school because it will not benefit us, it will only make us distracted. Teachers and parents would not be pleased if schools let students use their cell phones during class, were teenagers and we get distracted very easily.

Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be. First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work. The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right. The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend.

135,721,3B81809AA132,"""Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something"" yes people accomplish more when they are doing something. I believe that when people put in the effort to do more things that, it could help accomplish more for them in life. The reason why people accomplish more is because since day one theyve been working hard and every chance they had of doing something productive that it would help them get to where they need to be in the future that they would take it. They knew that at a point of time when they get a job that they would have to take care of their parent when they older. This is why our parents always push us and tell us to do better in school because they already been through our situation and it took them the hard way to learn and they dont want us to learn the hard way they want us to learn the easy way so that it would be easy for us to get a scholarship. Back in the old days when our parents were growing up they didnt have no technology to learn they had to struggle to learn, they didnt have no bus to take them to school like how we do now days. But back in the old days is was easier to get a jobs and it was easier get into colleges because all they needed was a GED. But now we need a Masters Degree, and a High School Diploma just to get a job that pays good enough for us to live by yourself and to start a family. Now it very hard to get an academic scholarship because now you need at least a 3.8 grade point average (GPA) to get an academic scholarship. This why we need to be always doing something so that we can make our parents happy and also make ourselves happy that weve made an accomplishment. These are the reasons why i think we should do more, push ourselves more to get to where we need to be in life as a teenager because our parents cant keep telling us the same things over and over for us to listen we should just listen the first time so that we could make them happy and take care of them as when we get older and into our adult stage.",6,7,6,6,5,7,768,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
136,635,9A36D8AB4818,"Community parks provide a lot of fun ways to spend time outdoors. One of my three favorite ways to spend time outside would be playing sports, gardening and exercising. Its a productive way to spend your weekends. First, Playing sports outdoors is very fun way to spend the day. You can play with your family and friends. You learn about communication and teamwork while playing sports. Communication is a life skill that is used everyday.

Knowing your teammates worth and dreams is always a great way to start a lifetime friendship. Playing sports outdoors is a great way to spend your time.

137,2735,827D807512AB,"churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Success consists of going from failure without loss in enthusiasm. I think that churchills is wrong about that failure of the plays in the pursuit of success because not many people are failure of there success and many people are in inspired from what they are going and so many people are pursing a failure. Firstly, not many people are failure of there success. For example people that are failure is not succeeding in doing something else. Lets say that student that goes to school that they dont want to succeeded in there education. That they dont want there education for college or a university if they dont succeeded . Another example is if you are not succeeding then you cant do something just as outcome. Secondly, many people are inspired from what they are going to succeeding. For instance people are are working or getting a job they have to be inspired of there job they have to succeeded in what they are going. They have to love they job or do a better to succeeded in there job. If you succeeded in your job you might get a raise. Thirdly, so many people are pursing to failure. They dont want to pursuit anything because if they do then they are not succeeding in doing something else. for example if a students want to graduate on time with there class mates they he has to get good grade pass the sol then he has to succeeded in school. They have to be enthusiasm meaning they have to be inspired.

139,2632,B204869FA146,"Is technology a positive or negative effect on human life? Technology is a negative effect on all human life because it is a limitation on communication. With technology there is no talking to others, so you become socially awkward. You would not be able to talk infront of a crowd and you do not go out to meet new people. People become socially awkward by not having the practice to communicate with others. You can not spend the rest of your life shopping online hiding from people. People who do not socialize hide their face when speaking, they can not even order food without getting shy. It is sad how the world is relaying on technology to do everything for them. Something that is amazing is having someone to talk to in person. You would be able to see their emotions and feel their energy when you are talking to them. People are not their just to listen but to also give advice to you. I do not think technology does the same. It does not ask how was your day or how are you feeling because it is not human it is a robot. When you do not talk to enough people in your life you start to become shy. You will start to realize that in almost every job you need to talk in front of a crowd of people. Even if you can not do that you will have to because that is part of your job just to communicate. That is why in school they start to teach you at a very young age how to communicate. Teachers asign presentations for the students to get comfortable talking to others. Practice is the best way to handle talking to others because talking through the phone and in real life are two different things. When talking on the phone you do not need to see the person you are talking to or you can even just hang up. But in real life you have to learn how to start a conversation with someone and keep the conversation going. People do not go out to find new friends. Yes, it is awkward going up to someone and saying, do you want to be friends. But that is where it all starts by making one friend you have achived a lot because now you have a friend that you can talk to and not feel alone. You can not stay at home just being online. You should ask your friend do you want to go watch a movie or go eat. That is better then staying at home a playing games all by yourself. Yes, you can talk with your friends and play games at the same time but it is also important to change things up a little bit. Just once in a while find something else to do rather than sitting at home. You can do a sport. You communicate a lot when playing a sport. Being at home you are just surounded but technology and you would never really get away from it if you do not try. Another thing: making friends on socail media is not the same as in person. There might even be a chance you never meet the person you met online or might not even be the person you thought they would be in person. In conclusion even though technology is a great way to communicate with others that are long distance. It is still important to communicate face to face. Even if it is just for a couple of minutes you should still have someone to talk to. So that later on in your life if you get a job that involves you talking to a crowd you would not be scared. Also going out once in a while is not bad. You should not just stay at home playing games with your friends asked them do you want to go for a walk then you could talk to them in person. It is always a good thing to stay away from technology just somethings. There are other things that you can do even alone. You can read a book, sketch and color, or even just have a nice relaxing walk just to think. Technology should not stop you from having a good life and communicating with others.

141,2928,EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because theyll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready. Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high schools dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school. Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have. Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others. This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

But having a negative attitude will make poeple fell unsafe around you and you will be lonely and not welcomed to the most of people. Having a positive attitude also help you to be a teacher because you will always motivate your students and provide for them education. The reason why students skip classes is because of the teachers attitude. students prefer the teacher who give a friendly smile. Positive attitude helps me alout to be an successful athlet because my coach is always happy from the way i act and my leadership that i do infront of my teamates. It makes me a respectful person and trustful guy. In fact attitude is the way the person present his/her personality. People with a negative attitude are mostly asocial and introverts. In my opinion having a positive attitude helps you to be a parent because the childrens get scared from the person whos always angry and frustrated. thats why most of the parents hide thier nerves and they act nicely infront of the child. Couple relationship consider attitude because most of momen prefer the guy with a positive view and whos open for evryone. The best way to live your life and be polite all the time is to have a positive attitude most poeple respect the person who give a smile and greet them. One of the importance of good attitude is bieng a family member. My uncle is the type of person who communicate and discuss with evryone and the way he talk is likeable from evryone because his always friendly and welcomed from poeple. Politicians with positive attitude are always persuasive because they use communication skills to convince the audience by telling thier speech. Attitude is a way to find a job because when the person get an enterview with a manger he has to answer the question kindly and with a respectful way. One of the reasons of bieng a good student is acting with a positive attitude infront of my classmate. I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life becuase its the way to live with poeple and find a job and create a family.

144,2573,6253F73FBABF,"As my opinion i disagree because ""you could be someone beyond the world"" if you are positive of yourself. you could take a risk of many things you want to do in life and become something wonderful of it. you can graduate and became someone you wanted to, thats growing masterly of no matter how many times you have try but where has got you. Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again. If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them. In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it. be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person. Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things. Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because there really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are. being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you. could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best. Sometimes is just matter of time for you to really tell yourself that you could try your hardest and not give because life is not about just being a completely fail nope you could tell youself you can do it because you got it.

But, if you are a person that likes science this is for you. one educational activity is a experiment because there are a lot of people that like to record data and find out how something works. Many people like to like to record data, so they might really enjoy a experiment. For example, in a experiment that a person has to measured and put the data in a table. Some people would fight for this task, that is how much a person love recording data. There might not be author person to fight for it but there is always going to be a person that wants yo do it. Experiments might be enjoyable to some people that like recording data. Some people might be in a math class recording data, but I think a experiment is more affected. This is one reason why I think experiments are a enjoyable activity. In the other hand, some people like to find out how something works. For example, a person might want to find out how the Faces of Matter changes. Maybe that person already knows, but want to know more about it. Therefore, that person does a experiment to find out more. Some people love to learn different things. other people will spend all their life trying to fine something out. It maybe new or not. This why I think a experiment is a enjoyable activity. Recording data and finding our how something works are just two reason why experiment is a enjoyable activity.

148,208,3CDD56FF3477,"Today, at school, most people are required by teachers to work with a group in order to prepare them to work in society and be able to communicate with their future colleague. I believe that there is more benefits for students to work with others rather than working by their own because they can share their ideas together and dont work alone allow them to be faster. First, by working with a group students can share their ideas and discuss on the work they have to do. By sharing their ideas, their work will be stronger and longer because every person of the group bring his own point of view, his own examples or experiences and their own way to work, to proceed. While working alone can be difficult when the student have no ideas or is lost and dont know how to do his work, so in a group they can help each others to understand and push them to work For example, if in a group a person have more facilities on the topic than others, she can help others who have more difficulties to work. Working by groups allow students to grow and enrich their skills to be better because they learn from each others. Working with a group help them to be prepared for working by their own. Secondly, working with other students can be more efficient. Students, by sharing ideas, are working faster because they dont have to find all by them self and do all the work. They can share tasks so one person have one job rather than do everything alone so its more efficient and beneficent for all the group but also for the teacher because the work will be done faster, so the class can move on and do more things during the year and if they help each other they probably dont need help from teachers, so teachers can be focus on students with real difficulties. Working with a group can prepare them for their future jobs so they can be able to communicate to other people and learn how to work not only for them self but also for everyone and they learn to help each other so they will be more productive in the future. For example, if in the future, they will work in a society where they need to work together on a project with many people and their boss dont want them to work by their own, they already learn how to be efficient in a community so it wont be a problem for them. They will be already used to work with a group and they will know how to proceed. Some people can think that working by groups can do the opposite and prevent students to work by talking, laughing, having fun with their friends, which can be distracting them or if a person in the group dont want to work it can impact others work so its unfair for people who really want to work and are motivated to have a good grades. However, students can keep working at home if they are late on their work, they can communicate by phone or they can meet during the weekend or after school so the work can be done in time or teachers can make the groups in order to prevent distractions. Also, if a person dont want to work and impact others work, the person will be graded lower which can motive her to work or if its not the case, students from the group can help her and to be motivated and push her to work by giving her little tasks to do or easy tasks. In conclusion, I think that working with a group bring more benefits for students rather than working alone because they can share their ideas, their way to proceed and work faster by helping each others. If teachers want their students to be more efficient and enrich them self for their future, its important that they do more activities and work in groups.

Since i started to be more positive in my life, everything was looking better, i found the job that i wanted, i bought my first car, and, me and my family move to a new house, overall everything was looking better. Based on my experience people should be positive and be around positive people, listen to positive music and found activities that incorporate positive attitude. People should find new friends that give good vibes and help them become a better person, because sometimes the problem might not be themselves , might be people thats around you telling bad stuff, and always making you a have a bad day. Changing the music that you listen to, could help you be more positive, because most of the songs and artists that most people listen to these days, sign about, drugs, killing people, gang related stuff, and thats good if you want to be positive. Founding activities that incorporate positive attitude could help also, like going to church, going to the movies with the family, or going to a motivational speeches, will get you into a positive mood and forget about all those negative stuff going on in your life.

This can improve human society in many ways by making life more easy, even kids nowadays are using different sources to find something fun to do or watch for example on the platform YouTube kids can find toys reviews or cartoons which its fine but thats also keeping them from playing outside.

152,3076,8DD09D4FCD4F,"Is attending classes from home by way online of videoconferencing a favorable method for students to study? Attending to classes from home by way online or videoconferencing is not a highly recommended way to study, because students will not have the same learning that they have while they are at school. If attending classes from home becomes a common way to study, students will not have the opportunity to build strong friendships with the other students around them, nor with the teachers. Also is not a recommended way to learn because students may not take their courses serious as they do in school because of the instructions of their teachers, or the advice of the counselors, or administrators of school. In the first place attending classes from home is not the same has being is school, because at school students take their homework, quizzes and exams more serious that they can do at home. When students are in class and they have any question about the topic that they are learning of the can freely ask their teacher and the teacher will give them a clear explained answer and examples in order for students to understand everything they are teaching them. In addition, if students attend to classes online they will not have the opportunity to stay after school for extra help, or to retake a quiz or exam, nor to attend to a learning center to have other students helping them with their homework; or to just study with the company of another student. As a matter of fact, students grades will decay due to not having all their questions answered, and their problems being solved. Secondly, if attending classes online becomes a common way to study, students will not practice their communication skills by not building relationships with their classmates, not discussing their concerns with their classmates, nor just having fun with their friends during lunch ship. They would not feel the same way because at school sometimes students get inspired by other students, they see other students not just as their classmates but also as their friends, they could even see each other as family, therefore, students with the time get to see the school as another home where they know they have people that could help them with school stuff, but also can give them personal advice, as counselors and teachers do. Moreover, when students are receiving classes online at home, they will feel bored, and also lonely because they will not have anyone to discuss their questions or doubts with. In addition, in our present a large percent of teenagers are dealing with psychological problems such as; stress, anxiety, and depression; being at school distracts teens from their problems at home or even at their jobs, and it is a great way to receive help and advice from people willing to help them; such as school counselors, teachers, and friends. Being in school is better rather than being at home alone just studying. Lastly, attending classes online is not the best idea for students who tempt to not take their studies seriously. While they are at home they wont feel the presence of a teacher standing next to them telling them to get their work done, or asking them to pay attention, and to not fell asleep during class. Also they will not feel the obligation to do their homework, in order to turn it in the following day. When students have to work in groups they learn lots of things from the teammates that they did not before, is a awesome way to inspire each other, and also to have fun, as students see other students work hard for their goals they do it too; but if these students are working alone they do the complete opposite. Therefore, this kind of students will think that they can do what they want and they wont take their courses in the serious way they have to be taken. In conclusion, attending to classes online is not a favorable way for students to learn because they will not learn the same way that they do while in school. The students will not work on their communication skills, nor their social skills. In addition, students will not take their courses with the grade of seriousness they have to be taken.

I am agrees because when being yourself the people see something special on you and try to be a person you like to learn new things maybe in the first try thats no gonna be perfect but you never give up to be different around a lot of person. three reasons for being yourself is important: first other persons gonna be like you, second you gonna be inspiration for everyone, third your accomplishments can change the mentality of many people around you. First being yourself is important because other person they gonna be like you, in a situation like you always do the extra mile, is when you help other no matter its no your job example: in the school you explain to your friend how resolve any equation of math but is not your job in the class, because you are only a student and it is the teacher responsibility of the teacher explain to your friend, and the accomplishment many person they gonna be like you Second being yourself is important because you gonna be inspiration for everyone, in many area like in your house, neighborhood, school, college, including church. For example: if you neighbor look it you clean you yard or your house or helping others neighbors, like cut the grass and help each other you can be motivation for other person, thats how complete your accomplishment of be inspiration for other person. Last being yourself is important because your accomplishment can change the mentality of others, than the people see it your progressive on your life doing thing the other people ask them self, how they did it?, you can leave a massage and tell them how you did it , and if you did it they can do it too. For example: in the family always we can see different type of family, one they have job but with lower salary, and one with their own company, if we are the type of person like to help your own family you gonna transmit that like good vibes, hope, etc. In conclusion, like the author said is constantly we like a humans trying to do extra things to have a great result and accomplishment in the life, and more then 50 percent of the world do that because the majory of the person see the benefits of help to others, and the most important the world see a positive side of this massege that the author said always do something else and our greatest accomplishment can be example for another person around of us because more than example we can be inspiration for many people in the world.",5,6,6,6,5,6,1462,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

I know that I cant just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life. ""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if weve gotten tired of doing other activities together, weve never got tired of fighting each other in the game.

Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I wont have to have help from my family.

Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you dont get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldnt do that thing again for a while.

I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because class would be more longer. If schools board add one and a half hour to school each day every class would be more longer. For example my civics class is two hours if they add one and a half hour than my civics class would be two and a half hour. If class was longer teachers would have to work more. They would have to work more because than they have to make more projects and grade more papers that each student turns in. Students would have to work harder then what they usually do because they would get more work because the class is longer. Secondly I disagree because if school board adds one and a half hour to school each day then we would get more homework. students would have to do more homework since class is longer that would get more projects and some students dont get to finish their work in class so they have to do it for homework. They would get in trouble if they dont finish their homework. some students dont get to finish their homework because they have to do more work for another class. Lastly, I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because when students get out of class they have to do things or go somewhere. Students have to take care of their siblings. Some students when they get out school have to take care of their brothers and sisters because their parents have to go somewhere or they have to do some work. Some kids practice sports in the afternoon for example soccer, basketball , etc. When I get out of school I have to go to soccer practice at 4:30 pm ,so before going to practice I have to do my homework and sometimes I dont get to finish then until I come back from practice. Sometimes I do get in trouble with my teachers because I didnt finish my homework. Some students have to go visit their family because maybe that are going to a party that they are making or they are sick and you have to go see how they are. Sometimes my mom waits for me until I get out of school to go visit our family. Some of then have to clean their room, wash the dishes, and take the trash out. I still think that they shouldnt add one and a half hour to school each day because each would longer, get more homework, and do after school activities.

156,1739,D26C9B0368D0,"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school. For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. Im not saying all students cant attend online classes at home, but most cannot. Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i cant speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them. School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You cant forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. Another reason being home schooled isnt a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them. School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. With out school you life wont be to bad but you know you can live a way better live with school. ",7,8,8,7,7,6,2919,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
157,1247,CFD0D13D3180,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill got the concept that ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."". Many people failed and successed in life. Some people learn by their own mistake, fail is part of growth. Others, feel like to fail is being a loser and cannot admit their defeat from a battle. In other words, they have no modesty. Success consist to not give up on your goals, to not leave your dreams from a simple mistake; to not describe yourself as a coward. Many people failed during their career, even the most professionals, but they kept trying. It may be that to fail bring some issues of closed minds, fears, etc. For example, There is a doctor that knows the hard work to finally done with college plus to achieve what youd love to be. This doctor studied for 7 years, this is a huge and long way of his career. As you know doctors never stop studying because the technology changes every year. Therefore, the start is not easy as, others, thought because the first stage of college, it may be the hardest stage than the others. Some people fail the first test, or the first semester so they prefer to abandon their studies than do better in college. This doctor have failed on the way of his career, but prefered to ask for help instance of giving up. The importance of failing is to learn and the importance of learning is to success in life. Above this, a 15 years old guy used to fail in High School and this student was down-hearted, but the family supported him without criticize him. It was not easy because some are not smart enough, but this 15 years old guy put a little bit of effort and now he is a doctor in Spain. Failure to faliure is the key of succes. Besides, Failure gives you more knowledge of your mistake and opens your mind to discover news to things to learn. For example, a cook is trying to do new dishes from differents cultures. Now, the cook wants to try peruvian dishes because the gastronomy of Peru is one of the most populars in the world. Also, this would be a benefit because will gain more money. By trying these new dishes, the cook fails because most of the customer did not like the food plus received many critical comments. As many cooks receives many critical comments, they decide to abandon the kitchen and do something different. This cook enjoyed when he commited a few or big error; to do better next time. Learned to do better the new peruvian dishes, listened to the rest of people and finally, succeded in the kitchen. Some feel ashamed to fail, they usually compare themselves to others because life is a competition and this may bring issues of insecurity. That is one of the biggest problems that many people have in these days. If there are 2 lawyers that wants to face a case of an innocent and important person, who is involved, in a serious problem. The best lawyer would defend the case and will be recognized as one of the best, would get inmmediatly many jobs for being recommended. On the other hand, if a lawyer fails a case would not get inmmediatly many cases often. Therefore, the lawyer knows that to fail have a positive side of learning, gives you more skills of how to face any case. In conclusion, as Churchill said that to fail is the start to success. As many people fail, they learn. Some people are not smart enough, but they put effort of what they want to do. Even though they fail, they keep trying because is the ability of their knowledge. People that are already professionals, they make mistakes and enjoy of their mistakes because they learn more of their speciality. Finally, even if you want to be the best of something, do not feel ashamed because life is a competition and do not closed your mind of making a few mistake.

158,1961,B6F445EE304C,"Dear principle: I think that changing policy so that students may not participate in sports or other activities unless they have at least a grade B average is a good idea. Students mostly dont try hard unless theyre rewarded. If you change this policy maybe students will try on theyre best to get a grade B or above. They will see their friends playing all these activities on their hard and best work. So next time they would want to try hard and play those activities. On the other hand though, not every kid is good at every subject. If kids try their best on the subject and still dont get a grade B average, this wouldnt be fair to them. They would be a lot of students who wouldnt agree with me because of this reason. Changing school policy isnt a great idea, but to make the students get good grades and to benefit their lives, in that case then it would be good idea.

I personily believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think its head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they cant graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill. Most of the students dont want to take a courses during the summer because they want to have free time , they dont want to work on summers. Some students work and save some money for college. They dont want to work for schools on summers. Theyre some family who love traveling with theyre kids. Most of the students want to take a elective courses but not in summer. Couses whay want to take is art, muise, and language they want. Some of the classes that students take as a elective courese can help them in college or in work force. Some of the elective courese that students take can help them find out what they like or dislike. Overall my position on this issue is that schools should offer a four years hight schools, instead of three years because its can hlpe students to get ready for college and work.

160,476,D45A0B7F9D48,"A topic that is frequently debated is whether students should be required to take a class in the arts,or should it be elective? Because of both students and parents opinions I believe students should not take a class in the arts,besides it should be an elective. There are several reasons to consider when debating this topic,for example:the class in arts will require a block that could be used for a class the student is interested in taking,or it could be used for a class the student requires to take in order to achieve graduation. As a student interested in having an advanced diploma,I believe art classes will not help anybody to achieve their goal of obtaining the advanced diploma,also if students are capable of choosing their own classes they will gain experience in that field,and be more successful. Students should be able to make their choice when deciding if they are really interested in the class,if someone else choose the class in arts for them and they didnt like it;they could ruin the experience of other students who are really passionate about arts. Students who are not interested in art could be a problem for the class and even their grades could be affected if they dont participate,or turn in assignments. Moreover,it could lower their GPA and their dream about graduating could be affected. In addition,art classes will not give them much credit as other classes,will not help grow their GPA,and it might not be as helpful as other classes. As mentioned before:not passing the class will lower their GPA,even passing it will not give them too much credit,and of course school want students to be successful during their journey through high school. The choices they made during school and the classes they took during school will impact when they graduate. As you have read,giving students the opportunity to choose either they want art classes or to take classes by their own choice could have a big impact in their graduation status. Schools should offer our students classes they are willing to attend,a class they feel will help them succeed in life,and in a way they enjoy their journey through high school. It might see insignificant to debate for something too simple like this,but letting our students take their own choices could help them take better choices for our society. Moreover,if our students are able to graduate and accomplish their goals our society will have more people that could help to assure a better future for our legacy.

If I ever get the opportunity to visit any place on Earth I would I would decently choose Europe. I would love to experience their culture and try new things while there. I would also go sight seeing and exploring every second I could. The first thing I would do in Europe is try out European food. I would go to a small town or city and ask the locals where their favorite place to eat is and what it is that they like to order there. After eating I would go around the town I was in and talk to the locals about what its like to live in a place like Europe. Another thing I would like to do while there is try out their fashion. I would go to different designers and ask them about the difference in the fashion from Europe to the one in the United States is. Lastly, since it is a special trip I would treat myself to a shopping spree. The most important thing I would be doing while there, is going sight seeing to famous places. Firstly, I would go visit the notorious Mona Lisa I have been dying to see in real life. Secondly, I would go on a walk to visit the Eiffel Tower. While there I will take cute pictures to post on social media for memories. Lastly, I would visit a bunch of art museums and look at paintings sculptures for hours on end.

163,2353,9B69DE203555,"When asking for advice, 93% of the people in America talk to more than one person. I think seeking multiple opinions will help you make a better choice rather than asking one person for advice. It could also help you out with other situations through out life. This is why you should talk to more than one person when asking for advice, you can get other peoples opinions, the way others understand your situation, you can see situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you can get other peoples opinion. Everyone you know thinks differently. Sometimes people may have some of the same thoughts but not every situation has the same solution. What one person has to say is different from what another person says. People understand things differently. Some people you talk to will not understand your situation. They will not see the situation the way you see it. If they do not completely understand your situation they could say the wrong thing. When they say the wrong thing it could make your situation a lot worse. You should always have multiple people you know you can trust and you could talk with to ask for advice in any situation. While others will know exactly what to say and do because they probably have been in situations like yours. You can see other situations differently. When you talk to more than one person to ask for advice you start to see things differently. It changes the way you think about any situation. You will have an open mind and you will know what to say when other people ask you for advice. Knowing what to do when other people ask you for advice can help you out with a lot through life.

164,373,BD9FE34E4670,"I agree with this statement, because one theres no knowledge without imagination, secondly Albert Einstein has made many inventions and he has succeeded, and lastly you can be creative with your imagination. one reason, is there is no knowledge without imagination, because your have to be open minded about things. Imagination isnt just a picture in your head. knowledge is something to see, and think about. its not hard to use your imagination its fun, because you can think about anything you want. even if you have to write a essay, then you need to use your imagination as well. Many people invent things, but before they make it they think about what they want to make, and they imagine what what they want. People invented cars, motorcycles, bikes, and skateboards, But before they made all those things they drew it out they took there imagination, and put it on a peace of paper. My second reason is Albert Einstein invented many things he might of failed on some, but he succeeded on many. He said "" imagination is more important than knowledge"" he made that statement because he used it to make his creations great. It helped him on many things. and it can help us too. For example if your are writing something, you have to use your imagination on it. If you are listening to music, then you are using your imagination as well. Albert Einstein was a very smart man. he had made many things in life, and we use it till now. Even if your thinking about something then your using your imagination too. People had made phones all different types of phones, People have made flip phones, iPhone, and androids they all invented that, and used there minds and creativity to make all that. My last reason is to be creative with your imagination, I chose this because if your making a book you need to let the reader think, and picture the scene in there mind, or if your reading a book then you have to imagine it in your head instead of just reading it, and doing nothing. Also if your teacher is explaining things to you, then you have to think about what shes saying, and think about what your going to do. for example I once had to make a assay for my teacher, and it was about life bellow water it was pretty hard, and I had to explain what was going on in the ocean. It took a while to make, but I ended up saying that people keep throwing trash in the in the ocean can you imagine how many animals, and creatures are dying every day because of that? I imagined all of it, and people should not throw trash in the ocean. Every time I read a book I saw it all in my head, and it was cool, and fun! Also every time I wanted to draw something, I would have to see it in my head, and see what I should draw. Even if you are trying to make song or some thing, then your have to imagine how the beat is gonna go, and figure out if it sounds good to you. Even if your making a poem then you have to think what rhymes or doesnt rhyme. Also there are doctors that have to see if they can save someone, they have to think and see in there head if they should get this, or that. Everyone uses there imagination there isnt knowledge without imagination. There are kids that get read to, and they imagine whats going on they dont just listen they think about what they hear.

165,1836,A87C80DEAB08,"People use to say that working make better life. In now days people who are self-reliance define as they need people to follow their instincts or ideas and their is also people who are usually follow their own ideas. Both of them are working ways that are preferred to people, But I think that people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters, Because it will make their life easier and help people who are having troubles in their life. There are a lot of thing that we cloud talk about people asking help from expert,But I got two of the story that I want to talk about and made peoples life easier. The first example is a true story that happened to me when I was young. It was a summer in 2010, I was in a summer camp for basketball at Generic_City, It was the first practices day and I was so happy, Because I could finally start to have real training for basketball. At that time I was in a private school that have no sports, So the only way that I cloud play sport is going to camp in summer time. Well that day at middle of the practice I hurt my ankle because of my teammate so I had to stay in hospital. In hospital I thought that I will not able to play sport anymore so I was really upset about it, When I was thinking about that, My father told me that life is easy and hard some time and life will never follow the step that people go, so they have to be stronger to be able to control their own life so they will not follow the step that other people went, After my father told me that I start to realize that life aint easy so I have to be way more stronger than before so I could be better me in future and it happened now, So that is the reason that I think with others help peoples life will be way easier than before. The second example is a story that my mother told me when I was a child. It is a story about a young man trying to make a hammer. It was a winter in long time ago, there was a young man that live in a really old house, At one day he was trying to make a hammer so that will help him to make a new house. So he traveled a lot of place to find a perfect iron for that hammer, In the way to find perfect iron he found so many iron thats not perfect in his eyes. But in one day he found a old man that are making a hammer, when young man came close to old man he found out that is the perfect iron that his finding all day long so he asked old man how did he found the iron, After old man heard what he said he laughed and said"" young man in this world nothing is perfect if you trying to make a hammer like me you have to make everything equally, And nothing is perfect on lest you treat them perfect."" After old man told everything to young man he realized that the iron that he think is not perfect is perfect if he treated is nicely and in the end he made a normal hammer that could really help him in the future. After my mother told me this story I realized that with older help you will know a lot of things that you never knew before, And this is the second reason that I think that with experts help your life will be better and you will learn a lot of lifes matter than before. Some people often think that they will decide everything by their self, And there are some people are seek guidance from experts and authorities. But I think that people should ask form expert and authorities help, Because it will make peoples life easier and help people who are having trouble in there life. There are a lot of expert that helped me a lot, And I think that it will help all the people who is having trouble in their life.",7,6,6,7,6,6,2250,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

167,2608,80E36876B2CB,"No more junk food in the cafeteria anymore. Students need to start eating healthy, and take care of themselves so they can stay energetic for the rest of the day. Cafeteria needs to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu, which would eliminate some of the students favorite cafeteria foods. Its a good idea to change to a new, healthier school lunch menu because students will eat more healthy, students will not be obese, and they will be healthy instead getting sick every other day. Majority of the people who eat healthy on daily basis are always in good health. My mom always eat healthy, and takes care of her diet, shes 60 years old, and she doesnt have any diseases or anything. Shes in good health. So, she always tells me to stay determined to eat healthy, stay hydrated, and that should be the case for everyone else as well. Changing to a healthier menu is a good idea because students will eat well, and start to like the healthy food instead of the junk food. Eventually, students will start to like fruits and vegetables instead of chips and chocolates, and drink more water instead of soda, juice, and stay hydrated. They will be diligence towards their diet. Students will eat oat meal, milk, yogurt, and some fruits in the morning from the cafeteria. It would digest easily and students will not have stomachache or any other kind of pain in the morning after eating breakfast. In lunch, they will eat proteins, for example: meat, nuts, and beans, also milk, water, stay energized for the rest of the day, and not have any disease or pain. Students will not be obese or gain a lot of weight. They will stay in shape because they will be eating healthy food from the cafeteria, and they will not have unhealthy condition of body or mind. Students will maintain their health, and stay fit by following their diet. Their body will not contain any impurities, and they will not have any diseases. Students will be able to play sports, run fast, accomplish their goals, and discover new things in life. Also, they will be more active. If youre fat then you become lazy, always not willing to work which is not good for health. You have to be productive in order to achieve your goals in life. Students will not eat junk food from the cafeteria anymore, and it would give students the opportunity to keep up with their body and be fit. Students will be healthy instead of getting sick every other day. Eating healthy is good because you learn how to maintain your health, and it helps you to eat well. Students will the eat the food that is good for their health. Eating healthy on daily basis, and going to the gym maximum twice a week can keep them in shape, and get rid of the illness. Healthier school lunch menu would benefit a lot of students, and illustrate them ""To purify, and be bright"". My cousin Generic_Name used to eat unhealthy all the time, even from school cafeteria as well, and always used to cry about how her stomach used to hurt. After six months she gained weight, and she was crying about it that shes never going to be fit again because she gained too much weight, but my mom told her that theres always a second chance, she was eating unhealthy, and wasnt taking care of herself so thats why she gained weight. She told Generic_Name about her healthy diet and convinced her to immediately start eating healthy, stay hydrated, do not eat junk food on daily basis, and be diligence about working towards her goal to be fit. Generic_Name listened to my mom and started eating healthy, she lost weight right after 8 months, and her stomach didnt used to hurt like it used to before all the time, thats why students need to eat healthy food from the cafeteria, and take care of their diet because they spend majority of their time in school. It might not be the best food for the students but its good for their health. Junk food is not good for health. Cafeteria should have healthy lunch menu. So, students can have the opportunity to eat healthy and not face any dificulties related to their health. Its a very good idea to tell students to fix their diet, and start to become responsible for what is good for their health and immune system. Students will not gain a lot of weight if they stick to their diet and eat healthy from the cafeteria. Students wil not have stomachache or any other diseases. They will be able to trust the process of eating healthy, and keep up with it. Cafeteria should only have healthy food. So, people can minimize the amount of junk food they eat on daily basis.

168,731,F673BCEC3BD1,"People who value self-reliance define dependence. Following your own instincts and making your own decisions is the whole point of life in my opinion. It makes a person more independent and trustworthy. Also, helps a person learn from own mistakes. A person will always have guidance. Whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you dont even know can give you some type of guidance. It always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. Independence is very important. Having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. Also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. Understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier. People need to learn from their own mistakes. Mistakes happen every day. A persons instincts may not always be right but it will benefit them in the future. Another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something. They may think they know whats best for you but personally for you, it could not be the best. Knowing yourself and knowing how you like things to be done is another example of self-reliance. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be the right thing to do. It can save a person from debating too much on a decision. Help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. As well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. However, a persons own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. And know whats best for them. Who knows you better than you? To conclude, its all about self perspective. On how you view things for yourself and your future. Being independent and not rely on others opinions. Having your own thoughts and opinions. Accepting that making mistakes is okay not everything has to be right and perfect. ",9,8,9,9,7,8,3678,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
169,2844,BA5DC45B0E3F,"Our character develop sometimes by our own choices, and other times it develops by the influences in life, we can choose what kind of a person we want to be either good or bad, some choose to be both you cant really pick a side and stay at it , theres good in every bad and theres bad in every good. Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs. Theyre wrong in my opinion because being a good person is better than being bad who are most likely the selfish ones that dont care about anyone except themselves. But in my opinion having a character isnt just about being a good or a bad person , its about having a good personality , loving yourself and loving people , making others happy , having a positive energy , but also most importantly not forgetting about yourself. No one can really have a perfect character everyone got a dark side in them but only show it when needed , like if they were hurting or something bad happened to them or any other life reasons, thats if you choose your own character and choose to be good or bad. Sometimes you really cant choose your own character because the influences of life will choose it for you nothing will be in your control , it all depends on the life you were born in , like your culture , religion , and the people around you , but thats not all sometimes the way life goes is the reason your character change you can choose to be something and lifes decisions will choose something else for you , life can be like a puzzle it never lets anyone stay as they are , they always change , grow up , be mature , or things that happens with them in life will make them grow up even if theyre young or still not an adult yet. For me I think age isnt the thing but a number , the thing that make you mature is your character and the way you think , if life didnt force you to have a specific character then choose your own character and make it different dont try to copy someone else and be life them , just be you , be different its more beautiful.",7,6,7,7,7,6,2507,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time. When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin. Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting. Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience. They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion. Playing the violin Is hard at first but when people practice and they want to be talented It gets easy.

Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students dont have a way to search a subject or a problem because they dont have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons. However, some students can take to other side,and dont pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia. Using social midia at school can cause a bad point of view of the school,examples of it can be recording fights, or sexual things. Most teachers dont allow studenst using cell phone during class because students can be out of the subject that the teacher is trying to teach,this can be a rock inside the boot.

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online. The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before.

173,986,CFA55621F274,"One of John Lubbock famous quotes is, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"". Some people think that setting yourself goals is something that cant help you in life and you have to follow what others do to be able to find success. They feel that people dont have enough potential to do things and by doing that they have to do what others do and not showing who they really are . I believe that choosing your own character is a way on finding who you really are because you can be able to show things that you never thought you were able of doing, you can set goals and try to put your best on accomplish them, and by setting your own character you can be able to help other people to follow the right path to success. My first reason why is good of showing your own character is that you can show things that you never thought you were able to do. you can be scared of certain things in life or wont be brave enough to try them but you have to be able to get out of your conference zone and try to step for yourself. this can help you in so many things later in life because you can create or be able to experience new things that can be come very interesting in your life. setting your own character can provide you on setting yourself goals too by believing in yourself and working hard everyday for what you want. it can help you in so many ways because you can see your own potential and see who you really. not being lazy it all and you would be able to have more energy in your system and try to work for something that can help you in the future and being proud of doing. Last reason why setting your own character is a good thing because you can help a lot of people too by showing them the right path of success. you can be able of leading them to work hard everyday and help them in motivating by not giving up easy on what they want to accomplish. try to provide them certain thing what they can or cant do making them things a little hard but believing in their self and working harder then usual. As you read, setting your own character is something that can bring you always to success, it motivates you and you can believe more in yourself on what you can do and getting out of your own conference zone.

In the follows paragraphs I would like to tell you what I think about this issue because i believe that everyone got opinions or some ideas about this new ""proposal"" as well. First, I would like to discuss if this ""proposal makes sence to me or not and wich are the advantages and disadvantages. First thing I may say is the advatage and the disadvantage that we probably can see or find in the proposal. One adventage that comes along with this proposal is one schools day less. If the school follows the whole proposal; we can say or expect that friday or anyday will be off; wich means no school for us. In addition, we will have three days free. So, we can spent more time donig what we most love or enjoy. In the other hand, we have the disadvantages. I personally found one hugh disadvantage, the time. I personally think that the time that we will spent in the school is alot. Just think about it , how do you going to fell staying about 10 hours in the same place , spacially when that plece is not home. You might be get uncomfortable, or little irritable. Secondly, I totally agree with the proposal because we gonna get more help on schools subject wich is good for us. Also we will avaible to do more school activities such as sports, fell trips, math stuff or any other amazing things. Besides, we will learnd more things such as lenguague stuff. like I said in my las sentence more time in the school could works for many of us. Lastly, One more day free. We gonna spent more time in school, but at the same time we also can get one more day free. Folllowing the proposal we also can get other day free like Saturday or Sunday wich is good for us because that day could be any day of the week. So, this means that we are avaible to do more thinghs that we most enjoy or love, for example, play videogames , go to the park , take wallks and other amazing things. Conclusion, the new proposal has a good advantages over the disadvantages. I completly agree with this and I am sure the proposal is benefial and will work for us. Also, we will save energy and resources , at the same time we gonna get benefits from it. ",7,7,6,6,6,5,424,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we cant accoplish it. For example: some people aim to be perfect; but thats imposible because no one is perfect. Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they dont have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en theyre wasting their time. The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if theyre aiming to high. Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short. Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure. This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for. Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if youre a failure, then youll face many challenges and suffer. Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people dont have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals. Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set. The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark.""

Working alone helps you complete what is task to you with no distractions, and creates an important skill to be independent. Working in a group helps with your commutation skills, and each person has their own role to play in a group, so its less stressful. Although, working alone is more beneficial, actually, working with a group is best beneficial. Those who believe, working alone is more beneficial have a point because you dont need to relay on anyone. You have more control on what youre working on, these are also your own ideas not anyone else. Working alone keeps you concentrated on what you are working on. For an example when youre working alone its less likely to get distracting by someone. Working alone can develop independent skill, this skill is good to have in the future. In reality no one is there to hold your hand and guide you. The benefits working alone are completing your own work with your own reasons and less distractions. However, the benefits on working with a group helps to get the job done faster. Listening to what others say is great listening skills; people like when you listen to them. In a group you can combine ideas and relay on each other. For an example youre confuse you have your group to explain to you what you need to do. This benefits your commutations skills and willing to speak up when you dont understand something. There is nothing wrong with reaching out for help, it shows you want a better understanding on the topic. Working in a group also has an advantage in speeding up the possess since each person is working on what theyre assign to. Everyone has their weaknesses and strengths, the goal is to find what best fits for everyone in your group, so you work together as a team. If you make a mistake you have your group to give you feedback on what you should work on. Additionally, working in a group can reduce stress because youre only focus on one part on what youre working on. We know projects, assignments, etc..can be really stressful, all you have in mind is "" I have to finish all this."" Working in a group isnt so stressful because everyone has their own role theyre working on. Everyone relays on each other to finish their own part, so they can finish faster. In conclusion, working with a group is best beneficial because you finish your work faster and its less stressful than working by yourself. You can learn new things by working with others, also it increases your communication skills. You can also help one another by focusing on their weaknesses and giving feedback. Therefore, this is an important experience to have because in the future youll have to learn to work with one another at any job you apply to.

178,1475,46977B27324C,"We all may have failure in life. In fact, we live in a world where everyone decides whether to be success or not to be success. In these days people are giving up on things that they might can do it, but they do not believe in themselves, going from failure to failure it does not mean to give up without trying. To be success, you must have to think positive and try it as many times as possible or as needed. The pursuit of success is a key to be someone in life. However, each individual has their own thoughts or opinions. Unfortunately people loss their enthusiasm that takes them to never be successful. For example, many people play sports; they do not always win. They have failures. Sometimes they win, sometime they loose. Having those failures makes them to keep practicing, learn from the mistakes they made and try to fix them. It is a important role that later on in other games will help them to win. Deciding to give up will help them to be successful in many things in the future. I had have many failures in my life. One of them is when I started to play the piano. I was twelve years old when I started. There was a time when I felt to give up because it was hard to play it, but I never loss my enthusiasm, I kept practicing untill I learned it. Having this failure make me think that if I never try, then I will never be able to success in life and neither to accomplish things in my own. Another thing, people had told me that I would not be a successful person because I have a son, who is only five months, my answer has been that I know it will be difficult to success, but not matters I will never give up untill I have achive my goals. Believing in myself is a thing that have help me to success. In conclusion, success is a word that everyone should think with positive. Having a positive attitude will also help to be success.

180,416,EEB4D170D513,"Albert Einstein said Imagination impacts more than education on people, I kinda disagree with this statement. In life there many things people want to accomplish something in their future life. Like learning a new instrument, to play sports for a team and others. One thing I would like to do is to stay on top of all my classes for school to be succesful in life. People say its a challenge to stay on top. When I look at it, I say every challenge always has a way to get through it. The reason why I would like to pass all my classes is because I want to use that as a skill in my life. At the end of college, people always wanted to be big things like presidents, surgeons and other important jobs. In real life people who cared less about that, are just sitting in a cubicle just to answer calls for a living, which is not a bad thing. I dont want my life to end up as those people, I want to make a big impact in our everyday society, like Steve Jobs. He made a big impact in peoples lives by releasing a new iPhone model every year, but he didnt just start a company that fast. He needed to be educated and was the smartest kid in his school, all the way to college, he was a smart and cooperative guy until his passing. Thats why I am planning ahead to stay on top of school and college so I can try to make a great impact for people. Instead of trying to stay awake in a boring office with the meanest boss in the world and with a low salary to one meal per week. Another reason why I would like to be successful in my classes is because It made a huge impact on my uncle, Generic_Name. Back in my uncles time, my parents and my uncle lived together in a small town house in Generic_City, he was uneducated. My uncle was an outgoing guy but didnt care about his education back in college, he was always on the couch eating Cheerios and watch Tom and Jerry on the T.V. My parents and I started to convince my uncle to start repeating college, but he didnt care, he just wanted fun in his life and not care about anything education related. That all changed when he realized that he had pay rent and that he wasnt educated, so he finally took the opportunity to repeat college, we were happy for him to do it. He scored high scores in all his tests and was awarded a scholarship for Generic_School and graduated with a high masters degree for law and got a job for jr lawyer. Now, he rose up to make the best lawyer in Generic_City and makes 500,000 thousand dollars a year and lives in a mansion with nice cars and to share all his fortune with his family. This story has inspired me that I should stay on task with all my classes and to plan my future career ahead in time. The final reason why I want be a successful kid in all my academics is because of opportunities, just like my uncle, Generic_Name, He came to the top because of smart he really was in college. Just like my uncle, I want to be like him and to open the door to so many career opportunities in which society has to offer, like Will Smiths movie, The Pursuit Of Happiness which was based on a real story . This talks about some emotional topics about a man named Chris Gardner was not making money and has his son with him to look after. He wasnt able to do his job right by selling bone density scanners and barely enough to pay rent or daycare after his wife left him. He got his life back together by repeating college and moving, but soon he opened the door to so many job opportunities and later in his life became a multi-millionare in 5 weeks. Based of this act, I started to think that anything can be possible as long as you put your mind to it. That way I can open many opportunities in my life. These are the reasons why I want stay on top in all my academics is because I want to change the world the way people see it. I want people to know my name for all the hard work and impact I did, staying on top of classes accomplishes anything, it can make me into a very important person who makes a lot of money, but in order to complete that task.

Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they wont have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,theres a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because hes always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldnt have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people dont tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,its an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, whove unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasnt for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldnt have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldnt really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we couldve ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning.

184,2194,332F7B4392BA,"Former BirtishPrime Minister Winston Churchill Once Said That ""Success Consists Of Going From Failure To Failure Without Loss Of Enthusiasm"". In my opinion, the former Birtish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement, saying that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Because in life, before you achieve any of your dreams or goals, youve to pass through some difficulties. Some people may disagree with Winston Churchill saying because theyve not experince any hardship, or any failure in life before. The reason is because they were born with silver or gold spoone in their mouth. They dont even know how hard ship is or looks like. Those people have no idea how it feels to be a failure, or a loser, or to even loss enthusiasm in life. Even though, some of them are rich today, but they when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and they even lost hope in themselves to the point that they couldnt believe that they will make it in life because of the stuggle or hard ship they when through. In addition, failure plays an important roles in our pursuit of success. The reason Im saying this is because if you dont have any experince of failure or without the loss of enthusiasm, you wont know the important of that wealth you have or your parents has. For example, my mother once told me her story that when she was in Africa in my country Liberia, she when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and hard ship during the civil war and after the civil war. According to my mother, she said things was really hard on her, and she said that she had no one to helped her to the point that she used to asked people in the community for food to eat just so she and my oldest sister can be able to salveged from hunger. In summary, the Birtish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statament that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.

185,1406,0E3C1F059C31,"Technology is the best way to contact your family members . For example in emergency and on special occassions like religous holidays , birthdays, anniversary, wedding that you didnt have time to attend . Also you can contact them if some one far away from you is in the hospital or someone died in your family you can contact one of your family maembers to see what is happening at the house at that moment. Also You can play games on your phone or listen to music while you are going some where in the car or in the airplane. Also you can order food from your favourite restaurante to eat at home or at the hotel you are satying at. Therefor you can check out books from your phone and read from your book on your phone. also you can book a hotel room from the technology now days or you can also take pictures and send them to your love ones. Another example can be that where ever you are in the world you can order anything from online store. Like makup kits, dresses or other things from the online store. Also you can purchase movie tickets , zoo tickets or you can go on a cruise with family. Also you can purchase tickets to travel to your dream country and do fun stuff there. Technology is also bad , because what ever you post on social media it will go everywhere and everone would see what are you doing and what are you up to basically the photos you take of yourself and you post it on social media the people are going to see it and it probably hurt you future career or your job that you are in. Also technology is bad , because people out there are literlly photshoping what ever you post basically girls , because they do inpropreate things with the photos of girls. Another example of why is technology is bad. Its bad , because of cyberbullying. People bully other people on social media and the people who are getting bullied cant do anything ,because the people who are doing bullying. they dont know who they are if the people who are getting bullied said something to the bully they will do something wrong with them. So thats why technology is good and bad try to avoid these things lif you want to post something out there just be aware of those people who do all these kind of things like cyberbulling and photoshopping.

189,827,7600F1C7D884,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally dont think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of youre classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think youd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily. Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when youre being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me its so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because theres no one around to tell me that I cant get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that were similar to that one probelm I couldnt figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face. When your in school youre never alone in a classroom because theres always other classmates and when youre homeschooled and its just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isnt always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes its good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you dont know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I dont really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work im doing, but thats just me i dont know how others are. Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you dont have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldnt talk to no one that worked at the school because I didnt trust them, until this day I still dont trust them but it wouldnt hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since theyve already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and thats because school can help you achieve youre goal and youre career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve youre goal. In conclusion, I think youd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldnt you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesnt matter wether theyre the ones who want to be homeschooled because youre the parent and your in control not them.

Accomplish more and always doing something is important to me because it gives me more opportunity to be successful in life . To begin with,by practicing playing my favorite sport ,soccer everyday after school and on my free time; because I was in my school team and I was really bad and weak at it .Practicing helped me to overcome my weakness and to learn from my mistakes ,and also to know the rules of the game and basis of soccer. Some people believe inactivity serve a purpose that led you to success;however, we gain life experience and learning from our mistakes if we are always doing something or we accomplished more . Also,by practicing soccer everyday and working hard on it,I learned tricks and how to kick the ball directly to my teammates and how to be good goal keeper and catch the ball as well. And that gives me more experience and strength to continue. Another example,one day we were playing and their was judgments there,choosing the best player to be in the ""International Soccer Team"" ,depending on how the player plays and how they follow the rules. Three days later, I got nominated to participate in the International team and I also got honored for being the best player in the game and of course, that led me to successful opportunity in the future.

Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own. First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it. Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesnt work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it. Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem thats why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. Thats doesnt mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do.

So after student done from work ,they can take online classes fom home that will make them more relax. Because after work is hard to focus in the classes but if students take from home they will have time to ate and more fouse. Online classes can give more time to do other activety,like sports, go out with friends. Sickness,transportion ,Parke if students sick so bad do they can go to school ofcurs not first of all the student who is sick can make the other student sickt too. So thats why the online classes can make the different for students additional sick persons may can not drive too ,and may not all students have cars and parking some time students vhave to pay fo parking too. Frthuer more the wather may not help smoe time to dive to anywhere. Families responsiblit,it is good benefit from families ,being to attend classes online.

It is true that to be success first, you need to have a clear mind of what you want to be or to do. Because in some of the cases can be very struggle and difficult to be success. For example, a very famous statement says, ""After the storm comes the calm."" This can be similar with the Churchills statement. Because this explain that it doest matter how worst you see it but it would be great after the problems or you are struggle with. Furthermore, to be successful you would pass by a hard things, for example something that people says, ""Nothing is impossible if you dont tried."" and ""Nothing is easy in this life."" This is a true statement that all people have to do and we have to know. Additional, the word ""failure"" plays an important role to be success. One important thing is that if somebody loss her or his enthusiasm or will power can be worst because that means that you are giving up what you have already and for that you already worked for it and dont want to fight that victory of success anymore. Sometimes you can fail but that doest matter because if you tried and tried again and again after you can get it. That would be one of your goals that you would remember. This shows how important is going from failure to failure to be success.

201,418,840619A0CF0B,"Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...Its is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something,or does inactivity also serve a purpose? The way you determine to do things is pushing yourself to do it, nobody gonna be there to tell you, when you gotta get your stuff done. We the people shouldnt be idle at all ,it would be boring ,not doing anything like just relax at home,and get fat on the couch,being lazy from time, to time isnt as bad. Also you want to have a break,so you wont stress out as much. Most people are determine to be inactivity and will get upset or,have a panic attack,health issues,It can affect your life to be honest ,and it sucks! thats how life is,it gets harder,and harder and you need to motivate yourself, makes your mind stronger. People who dont motivate themselves they got to at least try to get things done, and it never gets any easier....you just got to do it like this essay;Im writing. An inactivity does serve a purpose based on people who dont accomplish much by being lazy and not realizing how the situation can get worse instead of getting it done on time. People got to be always doing something ,and be well organized,it will also be wonderful too see people not being idle too always be doing something,so they would feel good about themselves and be like ""Yes! I did it!""and that way they wont have to deal with it anymore ,and move on with their day,just like anybody should. In order too always do something you should just look for something you like to do,to keep yourself busy like: playing soccer, working out ,rather not doing anything ,and just being on your phone on social media. In my opinion being be responsible and accomplishing is a whole relief ,and taking your time getting stuff done can also help to focus. For us kids our responsibility is to get good grades in school, and graduate,be successful in life to become better than what our parents were,or be a better person by being active and helping a church out .People sometimes need emotional support because everybody is different, everybody handles their attitude,or situations differently,and they might be going through something and it will affect their life. Taking a position of where I stand in school is me failing tests because,I dont study and I know,I should study but when I try too, I forget ,and forget the next day ,and I hate that, I know ,I can pass my tests ,and get better grades, if I studied this is one of my accomplishment I need to work on. Thomas Jefferson wrote that because, he wants to motivate people to accomplish more by doing things and finding a job, and work hard,by being successful. Thomas Jefferson also did some things,He wrote the Deceleration Of Independence,he is one of the Founding Fathers and accomplished being our President. There are lots of people in this world with different point of views of how they accomplish of always doing something,people try to plan out ideas to see what will work out for them, and help them think harder based on how they handle what works for them because,their is plenty of strategies in the world people can use to do something,what makes them feel more comfortable .It is very important for people to accomplish things that they need to do to get it off their hands and help each other out, if they need help ,and not stress about it but,most things you cant depend on someone being their,you got to do it on your own ,and if your stressing about it, you just got to relax your mind ,take yoga if you have too! but than again everybody is different and at least you need to try because,if you dont do that than where do you think your set of accomplishments is gonna go?.

202,2326,3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home. Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up. Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate. The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer. Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home. ",9,8,8,8,8,8,789,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
203,926,F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college theyll be ready because thats how college is online. Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed. Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work.

206,1641,6E3D46F9AAE1,"It is true that as soon as you stop learning, you stop growing as a person. Learning is what we spend most of our human lives doing; when you stop learning, you almost stop living -because what are you going to do then? Do the same things over and over again? You will always eventually reach a point when you are not even satisfied with what you do and know. I think we all have struggled with dissatisfaction at many points of our lives, it is as if we have reached a point where we do not know what to do next. Satisfaction restricts creativity; you start doing the same things over and over again, and like a scratched disc, the music gets irritating. Life gets irritating. The stuff that used to bring us joy have been overdone and gotten boring, we need something new. We are always looking for something new. We never reach complete satisfaction. It is part of our nature, curiosity. Even the things you are passionate about will lose their meaning. We need to do other stuff that we are not as passionate about to know what we are actually passionate about. Imagine me, a two-year guitar player with dreams of become a musician/music producer, going to college to study music and only music (mastering the guitar and only the guitar). It might be a bit unrealistic, we all know we have to take multiple classes to get a degree, but imagine if that was my only things. How will I bring something new to the table when all I know is what the past musicians have discovered and put together? My only option is to replicate and do over what has been done. I will need to find a new inspiration, a new thing to influence my music besides my music studies. This new inspiration will affect how my art grows, which is a reflection of how much I have grown as a person. We need growth. Limiting what you do, causes you to shrink. I have always put limits to the kind of people I can become friends with. It was not always much of a choice, but now it is. I have reached points where I could not be with anyone because I was stuck in a group of people that I did not like. I still get to those points sometimes, and I get sad very easily because I am unsatisfied with my friendships. Dissatisfaction has become a normal and almost natural part of my existence, which makes life much harder than it has to be. You complicate the human experience and it makes you shrink as a person, something you should avoid doing (you should always be going after growth). Limitation in most cases is not a good thing. Sure, many might say mastering on something that you love takes you through all the processes you need to grow as a person, but that is putting limits to how you grow and what you love. We can learn to do new things that we love and get to know ourselves better. There are always parts of you that you do not know or have not discovered because you limit your loves. As has been said before, we need to get to know things that we do not love to know what we love; it makes everything you love much more meaningful when you have to get to know something that you do not like. Doing things beyond what we have mastered helps us to grow and be happier. Once you stop doing and learning, dissatisfaction (and sadness) consumes your life and leads to a dangerous path. Emerson was right and very wise about what he stated. We should always be going after growth.",9,9,9,8,9,9,1438,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
207,34,DE8EAEAC72D9,"Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you dont have to worry about for college. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines. The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and dont need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you cant stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because hes so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two. The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you dont then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff. The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you dont have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you dont have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you cant stop because people that put the work they dont stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others dont because the were born with golden life. Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something dont have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didnt so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that dont wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.

Will I think its a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation. So this are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea. Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor so she can get put in a art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she good at while getting a grade for it. Students can learn how to draw if they had a art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students a art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students dont know that. One day, my mom took a art class because she want to learn how to draw. But the art class didnt just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing. Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to be come a artist later on in life. I know a lot of artist who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can be come famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students.

209,1452,E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in peoples minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives. The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called "" I Have A Dream "" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites segregation laws was. The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset. The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration. In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.",10,8,10,8,8,9,3354,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 10"
210,839,95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses. Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money. Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked 4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days. Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more. There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours. In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .

Every schools should have this option for students. This is make easy for some students. First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body cant make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he cant do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school. Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you dont have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you cant find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesnt have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor. Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class. Some teachers go to students home for the teaching just for one student and focuse to just one student. For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me. Studnets, should go schools this is not matter do you want go home school or normal school. some students have some physically problem I think they are need home schools because is easy then school because in school maybe somebody push and like some accident. For the physically students schools home is good because they can learning easly and they can focause better and nobody obsses. Some students, need go school for the understand better. Some students need go school because if they are stay in home and they want home schools maybe in not listen to teacher or make copy. For friendly some people is unsocial and need make friend in school.

I get that people use technology because of their jobs, but for other people is a distraction. Im not saying its a bad to have technology, what im saying is that now people dont hangout like they used to, they dont go shopping anymore now, they only want to be at home this is why, I considered a negative effect to peoples lives. Now almost teenagers, dont hangout with their friends anymore because they just can face time or call them without going out of their house. If they do hangout they are only on their cellular devices and not socializing; thats mean to the person that they are hanging out. They are only worried about their social media for example, they only see how many likes, comments and followers they get. Also, about what people say about them in social media and if they get tag in a picture. This is how people is now, they dont see the importance of talking to each other, they only want to know about what people say about them in social media. People now does not want to go shopping stores anymore, which this means that stores are closing because of people buying everything online. So buying everything on online is the new thing on technology, therefore people now doesnt need to go out to buy what they need, now people just can order it thats why, they are being more lazy. For example, if they want pizza they just order it online or they saw a cute dress, but they didnt wanted to go to the store and buy it, they just order it online. And they get it to their house, so they dont go all the way there. In this generation, almost everyone stays at home because they just want to be alone watching Netflix or being in their cellular device. Back then, people always went outside and play with their friends in the streets. It was fun to play with other people, people enjoyed it. Sometimes they even got the chance to meet more people. Now, if they want to be play with other people, they just download a game on their cell phones, computer or even on social media; now they have games too. Also, people used to go watch a movie or hangout at least, but now people stay at home because they can see the movies or playing videogames with other people online. In conclusion, people dont hangout like they used to, they dont go shopping anymore, now they only want to be at home. Technology had people changed a lot during this generation. But, what i have seen technology is a negative effect on peoples life. This why its not a good thing of having technology, because is keeping people away from the other people.

Also failure is a common thing that happens to people, and it also help us to learn better from the mistakes, then giving up. For example my friend Generic_Name, he had 20 dollars in his pockets and he went to a game store to get the news video game at was only 25 dollars. But there was even a new updated on a game that he already have, and it was 10 dollars. And he wont get paid back until two weeks and the updated wont be availed until next week. so he went bought the updated game, but he didnt knew there was a sale on the new game on the online store that was only 16 dollars. But now he sometimes check to see if there any sales or deals before he goes to the store. For another example a old man said he bought a new car but realize it was missing some pieces. Then he started to look round the internet to see if any of the parts that he needs are buy able. So far there wasnt a whole all of the items for the car. but he didnt stop giving up that easily. But one day he find all the parts and fix his car. Also I had a friend who was going to the park, but forgot where is the park is and sometimes forget how to get back. Because he takes along way back home and to the park. Which he should take the short cut like I tell him, but he doesnt care, he like long walks. but one day he designed to take the short path thought the area, and he kinda like it its easier get to places for him.

215,2052,F6194DEBEFA7,"Teenage is a part of life where everyone wants to be cool. Most teenagers are not mature at this specific point of age. They think if they will not follow rules they will look cool. Some people think curfew should be adopted for teenagers and other think it should not be adopted for teenagers. Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart. The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues. Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be. Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They dont do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent. There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.

217,2740,CEE41F7526FA,"I have some reasons why I would disagree with the school board because I dont like the idea of staying more time in school. Either way it is not a good idea because the school would face alot of work with the time extended plus its gonna be more work than ever with the school extending. And I have a lot of reasons why its a bad idea so I guess start the reading the paragraphs right now. First extending the school day would get a lot of students mad at the school because they want to go home and do whatever they want. The students would have to stay longer in the school and some would be mad and some be happy about it. And students that are bulllies would have a bigger chance on picking on people during the extended time of school. The next day the school would most likely be getting emails from students and parents complaining about the extended school day. While other students and parents wont care and go to school like a normal day and al lot more. Also the jobs in the school could change like the teachers job and other jobs in the school time would be extended. Some teachers would complain by the extended school day if there gonna do a extended day everyday they are gonna have to be payed more or else the school would die slowly because all teachers,staff and other jobs in the school would quit and go work somewhere else better and get paid more. If one teacher does quit their job because of the extended time he/she would most likely tell other people that the school is terrible then the school would barely get people to work there and in a couple years later probably the school would be abandoned for other people to explore to see the leftovers of the dead school. Finally the school would change by alot than before it ever has in its couple years of existance. The school would have to face a lot of consequnces like a lot of students posting on the internet about how the school is trash,boring and now they want to go to a different school. And the teachers would complain about if they are going to teach more than ever they want to get bad even more money. And they would have to change the whole school time of the day,the bus time and the students classes time which would took a very long time to do. Either way other jobs in the school would be more difficult than ever for example janitors,staff and teachers. Even though the school really does want to change original time to a extended time its not the smartest idea in the world because theres gonna end up being consequnces to it and they are not going to be fun for anyone. Either way next thing you know the county that owns the school will just die because of the extended day. Because then who knows probably no one then later on wants to go the either school in the county anymore and would probably just moved out to go to a better school. So this is why this idea is a bad idea. ",6,6,6,5,6,7,2847,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Second reason why talking to more than one person too seek for multiple opinions and make better choices and it will develop new ideas is because people will be able to get new opinions and for information to help them with their career.

People need more than one person to seek new opinions. They also need others to make better choices.

219,1144,C3429FEF8AEE,"I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes. One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my countrys weather not to cold weather. Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days. However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break, a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night Its mainly because were exhausted at that point we cant focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because were bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now. Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night. There are a lot of bad things on the road at night and you as the driver could of course from your long drive an turn tired and maybe crash. In conclusion I see why you dont want us to go driving at 10PM or even past midnight because of there being dangerous things in the night but I do also hope that you know that we dont stay up because of random things but were actually staying up important things like our jobs or after school activities and that we will be very careful in the night because we know of the dangers of the night.",6,7,6,8,7,5,1640,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
223,2243,35A7E263AC71,"the prompt says ""Unless you try something beyond what you have mastered you will never grow"". one would say that is something very wise to say .But due to the lack of wisdom around the world it is basically useless to say anything wise. I personally agree apart from physically growing Im almost done. Going back to the topic I do agree with what author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote, That if you dont try something beyond on what i have mastered am I really growing in any way ? I have try anything new and just do the same routine over and over im not going to make far in life .Although I cant think of a reason why someone would disagree the statement. I have tried many thing my seventeen years of being alive, and I can say I have grown to be the person I am now .Many people dont try new thing only because they are quick to judge on the presentation of the new item or new person , but if people actually gave the new experience a chance it could be life changing for better or worse . So going back to you trying something beyond what i mastered I wont grow or something like that its all in perspective if I wish to try something new and be a better person in society I will but if I wish to not try anything at all and just to the same boring routine day after day .Sooner or later I will get bored of everything .Even though some may argue by saying ""thats how I got successful in the first place by doing the same routine over and over"". In some cases that may work for example in sports the athlete must do the same thing over and over until the get better at the sport or like a dance they practice the same dance over and over until it;s ready to be shared with the world how well one can dance . And for others trying a new routine can lead them to success (well maybe not everyone is talented) In conclusion trying something new does change who you are in a bit by either helping or destroying yourself .People do grow to be wise and old and other dont grow old wise just young and reckless. Author Ralph Waldo Emerson was a wise man to say ""Unless you try something beyond what you already have mastered you will never grow. thank you for taking the time to read this essay .

224,1527,CF7AF5FA5DDC,"Some people say that having a positive attitude is one of the keys to success in life. Everyone around the world is trying to be successful in life, people fight for that everyday. A positive attitude is really important when you are trying to be successful, is sometimes what motivates you to keep going and achieve your goals.

This is important because it is not easy for students have expecifics aspirations and good options of careers at a young age. First, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you have to be sure about what you really want, you have to inform you about others posibilities, you need to know what are the benefits that some careers offer to you.

Students some times dont have time to go to school every day, some of them works in a part time jobs; Thats difficult to them because, they need to wake up earlier to go to school and do homework in the afternoon. Some students decided not go to school any more because, they need to work to pay bills, and help their families in home. Also, with this option students can be relaxing in their homes and studying at the same time. Another example why this is a good option for students is because some of them need classes to graduate, and they can not get that classes done by the school year, but if they have the possibility to take classes online they can finish during the year. However, this beneficial option is good for those students that are not eligible anymore to attend school because of their ages. There is a final age that students can be accepted by the school, and if they had more than the age the school said, they can not attend to school anymore, even if they want to continue going to school and graduate.

228,2153,FDE0B653AD74,"When you play activities or an instrument, dont you get a relief when you play them? I like to play volleyball, because I can make new friends, it gives me an opportunity in life to have a good life, and it is really fun to hit the ball when it flies really close to you. My first reason is that I can make new friends. Having friends is an amazing thing, because you can always rely on your friend and have some kind of connection to them. Friends will help you at any time, whether it is hard times, bad grades, fight with someone, arguments and others. Friends are always there for you and it does not need to be a daily conversation with them to be friends. If you have friends, you will have more success in your life and it will give you new opportunities in life, such as, jobs and etc. When you become friends with someone, you become a different person and everyone around you are happy and you also can make a difference in the world if you have more opportunities to have a great life. My second reason is that the games give me more opportunities to participate in any activities that I am interested in. Doing activities is good, because it keeps you healthy and a more enjoyable person. When you play sports it teaches you math, because the ball is circular and it has a circumference, radius, and a diameter. People dont just play sports, they play sports, because they enjoy them and when you play it, it feels like that you are free and able to do anything in the world. When you believe you can do it, you will be able to do it, you just dont need to give up if something goes wrong. My third reason is that it is fun to hit the ball when it flies towards you. It is fun, because it give you new experiences and different feelings that you have never had felt before. But to play a sport you have to have good grades and a good spirit of wanting to play the game. Sports are like your new life, because when you start playing, you cannot stop. It feels like you are addicted to the game and that it is so fun that you cannot stop playing it. When you are in a team, it gives a different feeling, because you have to work hard to get into the team. You dont just go and play a sport, it has to include how hard enough you have worked to play in that sport. My fourth reason is that you should never give up on any sport, if you already started it. Sports also give a different point of view of people. Having feelings is a really good experience, because it shows a whole different part of our personality. Sports give you a life experience that you will never forget, even if you are old. And, whenever you feel along you can go talk to your teammates about it and they will help you out with it. Teammates are the best part of the game, because they open so many new doors to you and you just have to work hard enough that you can go through the doors that you chose to live with. My final reason is that even perfect people make mistakes in games. If you want to be perfect in a game, you just have to practice a lot to become better and better at it. Practicing show your teammates that you care about them and the game. New friends always pop out from different angles in your life. Life without friends would be miserable, because you have nobody to help you in anything. Playing volleyball is really important to me , because I can make new friends it is really fun to hit the ball when it comes towards you, and give opportunities for a new and better life. In conclusion, sports are really fun, because you can always gain courage in the game. You can experience things you never experienced before. It can make you want to become a coach, because if you are a coach it will be fun to give kids what they want to play and get new ideas of new kinds of games that they can play. Your life doesnt always depend on the game, because we always have something else to do even if we have a game and it is always hard to find what time you are going to play the game. It is how the life will be when you are a grown up. Our lives always give us surprises that we dont expect. Sports are the most important thing in our lives, because they helps us overcome our fears of communicating with people.",8,7,7,8,8,7,3854,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

First I would visit the Eiffel tower with my friends. The amazing height of the Eiffel tower. When we were walking to go see the Eiffel tower, it didnt seem big, but when we got closer, it seemed huge, I was shocked because I never knew that it was very huge. Then on the top of the Eiffel Tower, the city can be seen. As we were on the top of the Eiffel tower I could not believe that I could see the beautiful view of the lights of the city. Finally we took pictures of the the beautiful surroundings of the Tower. My friends were very happy when we got to the ground, so we decided to take pictures, they had a big smile on their face as we took the pictures, the place was beautiful, we walked all over the place, and took a bunch of picture with the Eiffel tower, and where it was located. Visiting the Eiffel tower was a very exiting experience for me, and my friends, we got to see the view of the Eiffel Tower. Second we can experience the life of the other people that live in Generic_City. Meeting new people in the park is very exiting for me and my Friends. When my friends and I went out for a walk on the morning, we walked by the park. My friends spotted a groups of friends that were walking in our direction, they introduced themselves and we did too, we told them that we were visiting here, and they were so nice, and we started chatting. Then we experienced their food, and the Restaurant that Generic_Name and his friends like to go to. Generic_Name was a very special person, he invite us with him and his friends to the restaurant. When we were walking to the restaurants that they were taking us to, I could already smell the delicious smell of the food of the Restaurant. Finally we got to the museum and saw the famous art of the Monaliza. Generic_Name and his friends gave us a tour in the museam, and he told us that the most famous art there was the Monaliza, it was a beautiful art, but we couldnt take pictures of it because it the not permitted. But we got to see her beautiful smile, and I was inspired by the way, the artist colored the background of the picture. There was a lot of things we learned about Generic_City with the help of Generic_Name and his friends. The way other people talk, or the differences that we have among each other, and other places doesnt mean that you cant find good people, wherever you go, you just have to let your self enjoy an amazing experience in Generic_City.",7,6,7,6,5,6,2604,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

The reason behind this idea is, students are expected to identify a career bt hte time they enter high school, some good high schools helps the students, with the courses they taking, as a high school student they talk to their parents or counsellor about the career choice and what college to choose. In my opinion identifying your career choice as high school student. Because parents and counsellors looking forward to what career im having in the future. And identifying what is the best college for me to attend, because of my career.

233,2703,4E0094B179E0,"School is a time where you will receive assignments and it is your decision to complete them. Doing your work affects how teachers will think about you and how you will grow in the future. However there is one thing I disagree with in school. It is how the teachers praise students who arent giving their best efforts. I believe that true self-esteem comes from achievement and it is not right to support those who arent really trying. The first reason I disagree with the teachers method to boost kids self-confidence is because they are too dependent on others. They will look for someone to always keep them up but in a world like this you cant depend on anybody. They cant always depend on someone to help them succeed. Students can become too attach and expect to always be praised by what little they do. What would happen if their was no one to support them. They would do nothing because their wouldnt be anyone to motivate them. My second reason would be that they dont accomplish their achievements. When you accomplish a goal you have this feeling of happiness or relaxation. If students are always praised for their efforts they will never actually try to complete the task because they will have the feeling of completion. They have no reason to keep going if they seem to be done which could be a bad in the future. In the future they probably will fail their assignments because they believe that they have done good when they have but not good enough to complete it. Their are some benefits on teachers motivating students such as them gaining confidence and self-esteem. It could really help people in the future. You motivating them could later cause them to motivate others in to doing their work. I just dont want teachers to go too far and praise them for writing their name,sometimes you have to be strict. It might hurt at first in the end it will all work out. Those are some of the reasons of why I dont support teachers motivating students. Students should learn how to work alone and shouldnt ask for help. However im not discarding the option of teachers helping student. Im just saying that they should only focus on what those who really need the help. Hopefully their will be change and teachers will only help those who actually try.

In this essay I would talk about why is important to learn others people experiences. In my point of view, learning the experiences of others is important, because you learn something that someone had already commit that mistake and they tell you not to do when you grow. First, one person that had shared their experiences with me is one of my friend. He had tell me plethora of experiences that he had when he was young. One of the experiences that he had tell me. Is that when he had the same that I have, he use to go out of the house without asking permission to his parents. Almost every week he used to lived the house without permission. One day, he realized that he was doing something wrong, so he stop going out of the house without permission. He tell me his experiences, because he want me to learn that is your are below 18 you still have to ask permission to you parents to do anything. Next, when people had tell you their experiences that they had when were young. You already know what not to do when you grow up, because someone had already tell you not to do it. Maybe your grandfather, parents, friends, e. t.c. had tell you plethora of their experiences that they had. They tell you does experiences, because they dont want you to commit the same mistake that they did in the past. In addition to, they want you to do better them what they did in their best moment of life. Furthermore, they want you to do successful in life. One day, you are about to do something wrong, but then you realized that someone that you know did it before, and they had already tell you that it didnt went well. Then you stop and you think what happen to that person that did the same mistake you were about to do. In conclusion, maybe when you were young you did something wrong. You would shared that experiences to your children, grandchildren, and others, because you would not like them to commit the same mistake. Even that someone had already tell you not to do it. Finally, in my point of view learning the experiences of others is important, because they dont want you to do the same mistake. First, one person that have shared his experiences with me is one of my friends, he had tell plethora of experiences because he dont want me to get in trouble as he used to be when he got the same age that I have. Next, when people tell you their experiences, they want you to do better them what they did.

There is a bounch of students that have problems with slow internet, some times the internet doesnt load the wed pages and with slow internet we can not due our online classes. One time i was with my friend in his home and he was taking his class online like every day and then the internet when down and he did not finish his class online and the internet didnt work until the next day. Most of the time we get distracted at home, for reasons that are not even important at all like we wan to eat, our parents need help and they call us and we need to use the restroom every time and those reasons can be a big issue for people who take classes online.When i was in LOCATION_NAME i took some classes online, it was my first class and my uncle did not know what i was doing classes online and he call me more then 3 times and because i was using my headphones and i did not ear when he call me the 3 times he get mad, he disconnect the computer and the computer shot down, i did not finish the class beacuse of my auncle and the teacher tell me that i was so disrespectfull to her and she didnt wan to give me classes again. One of the most common problem is the student dont have time for example we have jobs and we dont have time for classes online. Some of the students are in club or they go to church, they also take care of there little brothers, with these reasons is why taking classes at home is not a really good idea. Do you really thing that taking classes online can benefit student? Issues can occur, when we are doing the classes online from problems of slow WI-FI and also problems or differences with family that may affect us in our concetration with the classes, thats why i dont agree of having classes online.

Well,I think students can be benefit this program,if they can work at home by the way of online or video conferencing,because students have more opotuniry to study like have more time to work,they dont need to walk or take a bus to come school,can be more effect to students,students can feel better when they try to stury because in his home there is not people talking a lot abuot things,but people talking not about the class. Also student can choose the time to they can star the classes,because some students have to work in a job,so when is cold outside and students they dont like to come school,they can wort at home by the way of online or video conferencing,students can be more responseble or maybe not is depent what class of student are you,but the things is there is a lot reasons of benefit for stundents can have that classes. Some students feel good working at home,there is not streess for them,they can take a break,they can eat and his work. They spend more the energy of his mind etc... I think the best option for students to attend classes from home by the way of online or video coferencing to learn. But also is depent waht classes student do you are,because some student are lazy when they work at home. Also parent can check his work in look if they do his work good or bad,take classes online is one think like because for me is more aesy to do my homework,so inconclution students have benefit from being able to attend classes from home.

242,1602,9528CA8FFC22,"Farmer British prime minister Winston Churchill once said that Success consists of going form failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with Churchills Statement because some time in life u fail but never gave up in life. keep fighting and you will get to the place you want to get. Work hard if u fail and fail never say im done trying the same thing over and over. Because one day u will not know what will happen if u keep trying. Firstly,Some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss some time people feel safe without loss in their life. For explane you trying to became a prime minster in the future and people telling you. Cant became a prime minister but all you get to do is work heard in life true in yourself you can do anything you put you mind to in life. Secondly. some people think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Some people think that failure to failure is good because some time people like to try one think over and over on tell they do good at it so that what some people think in life to gave when the chances to do the same thing over and over even if they couldt do it they just when to keep trying. Sometime people think that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss. Because they dont like to keep trying one thing over and over so they feel safe without loss in their life. But other think that success consists of going from failure to failure with a loss. Because people like to try the same thing over and over on tell they do good at it.

But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals. The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant. Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping. In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing.

According to the Minister Wistom Churchill from Britain about the phrase tha he said ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiam"" is 50% percent true and 50% percent wrong. For example a person who reached the success in hard way is the now trending disigner of the brand ""Off-White"" he said on a nterview that ""it wasnt easy to be in here that Im now you know?"" cause when ll this started I didnt had help so i find my own help with the company/brand Nike to use some of they sneakers to make my shoes design come true, i didnt have the answer of they in one day- NO! I tried and tried to get one response until one day that they say ""Yes were working together, you can use all of our sneaker desing to make your work"". Now the colaboration between Nike and Off-White in a trending colab now in these days. This example is a hard way to reached the success but now we are going to see two cases of ""easy success"" Two exampe of ""Easy succes"" are the actress Natalie Portman and the Ex-Proffessional Boxer Mike Tyson,they got their success cause they are naturally borned talented. For Example the case of Mike Tyson, he was a 12 years old fighting in the streets to gain some money for his family till one day a man saw him fighting with an older boy with him in which fight Mike won, the man saw in Tyson a potential legend in the world of the Box. Another caseis the case of the famous actress Natalie Portman, she has been a talented actress since she was a little girl. One day a friand of her mother told to Natalie to make a try to win a paper in a Hollywood movie in which Natalie won because she was naturally born a proffessional actress, she just make her future with her talent.

245,1448,6642E181B08D,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else. no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework. In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people) they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it. Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer. I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do ) to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue. and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter. In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.",6,5,6,6,4,4,1334,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I think that learning about the future is something I would have never thought I would do in times to come but here we are, they talk about it all the time but never do it so I would like to change that reality. Therefore that is one thing I will like to accomplish in the future. Have you ever heard Never knock it till you try it, thats what i will be talking about. There are a lot of thing I have never done in my life, one of them is playing music, I always listen to music like rap or pop. I have always wanted to do the guitar but i was too scared to do it. Now I take lessons for it, im trying to play it in other places. I have also wanted to rap I have it in me I just have to try and get my vocabulary up so I can say more in my music. I will start to take trying new thing serious. Fact checkers say that people who always play sports will live longer. What I will try to accomplish is playing every sport. I already play soccer so I am try to play more variety of sports. I have stared to play basketball more, I think right now playing basketball is more fun than soccer. I have played baseball and its fun but it is not for me, but as I said this is what im going to try in the future. The limits of your language are the limits of the world, once said by Ludwig Witgettein. In the future will like to learn more about peoples language and where they come from.

First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now. People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesnt understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesnt talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better. People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didnt know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasnt good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he wouldt get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesnt have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes. The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world wouldn be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesnt know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they dont have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they dont even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as its today, everything would be in peace. In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again.

250,129,6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources. I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things. I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week. My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do. Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students. My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think. My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they dont add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers.

251,2754,FF7FE6BD8509,"I agree that first impression is almost impossible to change. No matter what you always want to stand out of the crowd and show the best of you. People are always going to think of you of how you first were when they met you. The first impression isnt just about you acting in a certain way. Its also about you showing them your character but most important to get them thinking good things about you. I have three examples of why first impression is important. My first example is that Generic_Name wants his parents to meet his girlfriend. He thinks thats her first impression of how she acts or on how she greets her self towards them is something his parents are going to be looking at. Most Guys like Generic_Name want their girlfriend to have a good first impression so their parents like her. Then second example is on the first day of school teachers always want to give their students a good first impression about them. Either on how they teach or how smart and fun they are or anything so the students like them. Last but not least my third example is when a school goes on a field trip to a museum or to another school. They want to have a good first impression on any other school thats there or anyone one because, youre representing your school. There are people who believe that first impression by a person dosent always show how they really are. For example when youre on a date and you might be dressed in a way or talking with a different type of slang. But that dosent trully demonstrate that if the first time you guys went on a date. That on the second date you can give a better impression than you did the first date. You cant always judge someone by their appreance or on how they are. Another example is that if youre best friend thinks that you want to be with the prettiest girl in school you might want to step it up and change the way you are. You can change the way you are and the first time you meet her you were rude but youre best friend thinks she will like you if your sweet and friendly. Not everyone thinks the first impression is hard to change. However,I still believe that the first impression is the most important no matter what the situation is. I also still believe that the first impression is hard to change. Some people are different then others they dont all believe the same thing but in my case its hard to change how people see you the first time because,after that they are going to always look back at that and remember how you were. You always want people to think he best of you because,there going to be a situation that if they need someone they are going to look for you. To the people that think first impression arnt important they really are. You always want to show people the best of you no matter what. It dosent matter who youre with or where you are its always about showing the best about you so people can always look back see that you stand out in between so many people they will look at you. For example If your getting a job and you have a job interview at a certain time; You either might want to be there earlier then the time they gave you or on time. You have to impress the boss or the person interviewing you and blow their mind and why you would be a good person to be hired for that position.

Most of the students prefer online classes because they cant get transportation from home to class. Video conferencing and online classes would benfit students in a way that their will be less distraction and work in your own level. Society now in days has many bullies in school that it comes to the point that studuents dont want to come to school and prefer taking class at home by there self. For example I had a cousin that took online class at home because he had no transportation to get to school. He was able to benefit better at home because even when he was sick he would still be able to accomplish his work. Most of the teenagers want to go to school but they cant because they have no way to get to school. Online classes and Video conferencing is way were students can get education and graduate without leaving their house. My cousin got education and he graduated and he only took online classes and it helped him a lot due to not having tansportation to school. There are many kids out in the world thet get bullied in school and they want a education but they cant due to bullys. Classes at home can benefit kids getting bullied in many ways for example, you wont have to worry about getting bullied at home if you take classes at home, you will get less distraction, and you will work in your own level taking classes at home. Therefore, This is why I agree that students can benefit better taking classes at home in many ways. Online classes and video conferencing may benfit some people but due to experience with family members and friends I feel like it benfits most of teens in the world. Not all teens get to have education due to many reasons which is why I feel like it can benefit many teens in taking classes at home.

257,1645,9A5193D1C19B,"Positive attitude is the key to success in life. It has a big impact in our life, and remove negatives thoughts in an incredible way. Also, if we do not start thinking in a positive form; life will be hard for us. Furthermore, positive attitude guarantee a different way of thinking it can change the way we are, and how our minds are more open to others opportunities. I agree with positive attitude because it can change our lives for a better future. Positive attitude is the thing that all humans needs in life. Firstly, if we have a positive attitude our lives can change in the way that very few people can reach. For example, we will gain more opportunities to jobs like have a good recommendation of the society, finding jobs would not be that hard, and gain to have more friendships. In addition, other case is the behave with the family that almost all young people has for example: having good communication, feel good around them, etc. Also, discussing with other people would not be a issue because we are prepare for how negative attitude appears in the persons who does not want to change the way of think. Moreover, our positive attitude can change the mood of a person. Secondly, positive attitude improves our mind state in the way that negative thoughts cannot go into our brains. However, sometimes this negative thoughts can also ruin our day by putting obstacles like, the boss is angry and we do not know how to react, having a bad lunch, or no having enough hours of sleep. but, positive attitude has a big impact that right away make us think in a different way and make us feel secure. In sequence, an experience at school that all human being has is when we have a test and we are worry that we will not pass, the teacher comes and say ""is not a big deal, i know you all can do it"" and that is where positive attitude comes. Also, positive attitude has to influence in everybody, so we can have a better world. Thirdly, we all are different, but we can try to improve our skills in positive attitude by reading books, listen to other people, and make a change in our habits. On the other hand, we can try to make contact with people that has positive attitude to the maximum, they will help us to see things from a different perspective of view. In addition, introducing new people in our lives will make a big change. Also, it will make us more responsible at the time that we have to read, write, or talk in an appropriate way. lastly, this will lead us to a better and different way of think; it will improve our knowledge. Lastly, positive attitude can support us by building a better future for our lives. But, sometimes it can be difficult to manage our emotions. Positive attitude can improve us to do better in our emotions. It will make us strong in whatever situation we are passing through. A lot of people that are around us would not like it but, is a process that we want for be different than them. Positive attitude is ambition for those who wants to live better and wants to reach their dreams.",8,6,6,6,7,6,2048,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
258,1285,144671E445D0,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote ""Do you think that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control?"". Well some people believes we choose our own character traits or influences by our control. Other people doesnt agree that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control. I think that we choose our character traits, or our character is formed by influences beyond our control because were doing things that maybe enjoy doing, or we get to choose what we want to be. And I am going to talk about this and why I agree on this. I Agree that we get to choose our character traits or formed by influences beyond our control because you get to do anything when it comes to you becoming what you wanna be. Another reason is that no one can control you on how you should be later on in the future. I also think that doing the things you like to do would change you for example, helping people that are in need will make you a better person because youre controlling yourself on what you are doing. Another example is that if youre doing bad things, it would make you a bad person because of your actions. Thats why people think we change our character traits by choosing our own or formed by influences from our controls. Other people doesnt agree that we can change our own character traits or formed by influences from our controls because they think it cannot change their own character traits from the actions they do. Also many doesnt believe that doing what they wanna do wont change them later on in the future. Another reason is because they dont believe that we cannot choose our own character traits and that it should only be 1 trait about yourself. For example doing something positive wouldnt effect them because they can easily change and do something negative later in the future. Last thing is that they dont think we get to choose our own traits and basically say that we are born the way we are without changing our character traits. This makes me think if people who doest believe that they can change their character traits or controlling their influences can be a bad thing for them. the reason why i think its a bad thing is because they dont think they cant change the way they act with actions they do normally. For example, they think doing positive actions would not change their character traits. Changing your character traits can make you a better person because of the positivity you are spreading. if you spread positivity or have a good mindset could change your character traits. So in this essay i believe that people can change their character traits or formed by influences beyond our control. I say this because you can choose what you wanna be or act later on in life. Another reason is any actions people can do also makes them change their character traits. This is very good if you treat others with respect; you will be a positive person. This will also help you in life because if you think down you wouldnt be motivated, but you can change that by doing something nice to yourself or to someone. That will give you a good mindset and want to do it more often if it helps you feel motivated by making someones day .",5,6,6,4,5,5,278,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
259,2149,603863409B06,"Most of students live with so much stress for study so hard and each time they depress more. They need to take a break sometimes. May breath fresh air and entertain themselves in something that can motivate to follow forward. I agree that students should be required to take one of these classes. Its very important to be creatives in some moment. Taking that type of classes make to students being relax forgetting for a moment the problems, helps to lose some fears, and above all they can benefit in their future. Arts in general can help to people who can need a break of all the problems they have everyday and thus not live with stress. I have a friend who live with so much stress for every thing he pass. He try to be the best in all of his classes, but that cause more stress on him. For that reasons, he decide to take one or two free hours everyday to relax himself. The best decision he take was to choose a music class. After he start to take the class, he told me: ""The guitar class is very amusing and interesting. It helps me to forget all the problems that cause me stress. It was the best decision I take."" Now I see how my friend is so happy and calm after he start his guitar class. He changed because he found something that he really likes to do and that helps to be relax. The performance class helps students to being more sociable with the others and lose one or more fears. Im a girl with a lot of fears, but my biggest fear is to talk with others. That fear start to appear with the passing of the years. I was not a timid girl when I was a kid, but little by little I think more in what the rest think about me. Thats why I decide to take a drama class. I need to confess that the first classes was very hard for me because I didnt speak with anyone, but with the passing of the days I start to speak with my companions. They were kind with me so that was more easy to me to have a conversation with someone. The art classes can be very important to some people because it helps to have a good future. I have a teacher who I always show her my drawings and sculptures because she is my favorite teacher. She is not a art teacher, but I know she appreciate me so much because every time we talk she told me: ""Your drawings are so beautiful, in the future you can be a teacher of art or sculpture. I know you are going to have a great future doing what you really likes."" I think a lot of what she told me and probably after I finish NOVA Im applying to some university about art, and maybe I can apply for a grant about art. In conclusion, its better if students take a music, a drama, or an art class so that can relax and have fun at the same time. Most of the people believe that type of classes should be electives because some students dont like to play a instrument, act, or even drawing. But I think that every student needs to take one of that classes to leave all the stress away. That type of classes are for students to turn on that creative part that they have inside and can have fun, not to being boring and stressing every time. Its good to take a break sometimes.",7,6,7,7,6,8,1246,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
260,1026,43B0E1211D58,"School is a very important part in a persons life, however it takes away most of students and teachers day. In a normal public middle school in Maryland, a student first class starts at 8:15 in the morning and the last class ends at 3:00 pm. Which means that a student spends 7 hours and 25 minutes in school, that is a long time for a person to be receiving information nonstop. The school board should not extend the school day, because that would take time away from activities that students need or will need in the future, such as: students would have less time to do homework or study, students would have less time to participate in after school activities like sports, and students wouldl have less time to volunteer in community events. Students would have less time to do homework or study. Students already spends more than seven hours at school and usually has 6-8 classes that last 45 minutes each from those 6-8 classes at least 3 would have assigned homework to the students which means that the students would need time to complete their homework with accuracy, if the school days werre extended students would have less time to complete their homework which means that their grade might go decrease for missing assignments. Students would have less time to participate in after school activities such as sports, or clubs. Every healthy person should exercise for at least 1 hour per day and at school not every student takes physical education (P.E.) as a course which leads to the thought that students might not me be getting the necessary amount of exercise per day, and even if a student did take P.E. a normal class lasts 45 minutes, which is not enough for a healthy person. If the school board were to add one and a half hours to the school day students would have less time to practice in an after school team. Clubs are just like sports are a very big thing in a school, clubs shows students opportunities they usually would not get in a school day. if the school board were to extend the school day students that are parts of clubs would probably get less time to spend time in those clubs. Students will have less time to volunteer in community events. Community service is usually a requirement in most curiculums, in past experiences I have had to have 75 hours of community service those hours were earned for volunteer work, like helping a teacher with younger students or helping a teacher organize her classroom before the school year, etc. . Those acts were usually done after school and usually took around 2 hours. If the school board were to extend the school day srudents would have less time to finish their community service and could eventually fail beacause of not enough volunteering hours. Overall it is just more convienient for the school board to not add anymore hours to the school day so students can have more time for their other activities like sports clubs and community service",7,6,8,8,8,7,881,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

I disagree because student might not like any of the options, have no time ,and want to just want to be with family. My first reason, is that student might not not like any of the sport,clubs or activities that they are offering at school. Many student do not want to get vary involved with school to much. They just what to go to school to learn,get good grades and pass. Some students do not think they are good at sports or clubs. student just do not want to worried about the games the days they have to stay. There are other students that might like other actives out of school. Like riding bikes,or they might be more in valved with church. They might be in a youth group at church and can not be involved with other things cause it nigh get stressful to deal with two things. This is why some students would not want to get involved. There for,some student do not have the time to join a team or do any clubs or activity. If a student has to join a sport or club after school. Some students would not be able to go or get picked up. The parents of the student might have to work long hours and every day of the weeks. There for, the students would not be able to get pickup after school. Which means that if the student would want to play a sport he would not be able to cause they have to work to proved for there families, which would make them not be able to show up for the games or clubs. some student might have to go home and take care of there little sisters or brother at home. They might even have to cook and clean up cause there parents are working or there are problem at home. there are so many things student have to do at home depending on there life style at home. There are also families that get home and have to help there mom out in the kitchen and clean up and get read for to go to church. There would be no time to join an active cause there would be no time to get piked up cause you might live far away from the school. This is why I disagree with making student join school activates. My final reason is that student might just spend time with their families. Many student might get home and there is no one wanting for them at the door. both of their parents are working. They might not even see them at all or maybe only a couple of hours. But it is those horse that they get to see their family and get all together and have dinner talk to gather about how their day went and what they did.

The program could help both of them learn something cool, interesting and the older ones can learn how to assist a kid and could share different opinion that they cant share front of the teacher about learning. One way the program can help both younger and older student is by. They both can learn about something they have never learned or what they young want to learn about. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say different stuff that they are learning. The older can each them what they are learning in class. This could be a mini deal that both have with each other and it could help. Another way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The older ones are almost ready for job. He could learn more about how to control a kid and teach them or assist them. The younger kid could tell them ways and teach them. This could lead to a good bounding with older students. I think they would see each other after years and be like I know who you are you were the one who assisted me. Last way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The feeling a student has is like why are we doing this. Is this even related to anything. They would able to give there opinion what they think about the topic or subject. Mostly students are shy front of class, but that would be only person to person, they wont be shy. This could help the students explain there self. I think it would make both of them feel comfortable. I think this program would help alot of the students confident to talk to people and learn in a fun way.

For example, if someone is going to vacations, breaks and traveling around the world all the time, they probably dont know that is going on in the present or what are the news of the day , they are not being educate but in this case we are talking about the students so i think if students have really logers breaks all the time they are not going to be educate when they grow up , they are not going to do things by them self because they are not going to know how to do something . second of all, giving breaks to the students all the time its is not good because, they are not going to have a good behavior in their future, some teachers works really hard to teach those students who dosent have the ability to learn like others and when they going to vacations or breaks , all the hard work that the teachers were giving to the students will be gone because, they will not been focusing in school or they will not being focusing in what they were learning about. Also when students go to vacations or breaks they only think about having a great time with friends or family and i know that their are some others kids or students that sometimes are not like those students who dont really care about their future and i honestly think that if all the students could be educate individually will be a really good idea . Finally, i think that the parents really need to know how important is to being educate when u are young because , when a person stars growing up everything in your mind change too. As adult i can say that it is hard to learn things when u get older. Sometimes when you get old, you star getting more lazy but when you are young it gets easy because , the only thing you have to do is study and focusing on school so that is why i think being educate is really important for a human and it is not good to be wasting time in longers breaks or vacations when we can waste all that time doing proyects, homework and activitides in school, and if the students have longers breaks then they will forget the knowledge during the breaks . As a result , i think having longers breaks it not that really necessery for students specially when they are young because, a student dont really need that much time to relaxing or that much time to have a free time doing nothing . Also i can say that a student dont need a really a long break because, when i was in high school the only thing that i needed to be focusing on was in school becuse i wanted to have education, i wanted to have a better life and be a good person in the future. I also think that when you are educate you have more opportunity to get a job. For example , if you are not educate and you want to apply to get a job, the manager it is going to see that you are not educate enough to be working in the place ,so you absolully not going to have a chance to get a job. And i think that is really important for getting a job in whatever place you want to work in, so i really think that the students should not have longers breaks during the school year , that way students will be more polite in school and they will be focussing in learning more things that is going to take them to a better place ,to a better life and to a better future.",5,6,5,6,5,5,817,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
269,76,81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like theyve had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path. When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career. Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they werent good enough didnt just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. Theyve taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, theyve given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts. However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be. In conclusion, setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people.",8,8,8,7,7,8,1713,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
270,2547,45A86623B659,"Do you agree or disagree about the importance of attitude? I agree with the importance of attitude, because with your atitude you can motivate yourself to do the best in your life, and you can motivate other people to do the best in their life. Some people think that in this life your positive attitude is the key to do good in everything, because if you go to any place, job, or to the school with positive attitude your life its going to be excellent. In this life the success is the key, because if people have negative attitude in everywhere, they just dont want to nothig. For example, if they go to the school/collage with negative attitude, maybe they dont want to learn new things about the class, because they are going to be mad, and they dont want to do work with negative attitude, but if the people go with positive attitude they can learn averything they want, or learn more than they know about the class, because be positive means that you want be success in your life, also means that people want to do the best in everything. Second, people can do better in this life with positive attitude, because they want be graduated from collage wih positive attitude, and with them positive attituted they maybe motive to other people to do the same thing, with their positive attitude they learn more, they are going to do work, homework, and classwork, because in this life the key is the attituded, that means everything you do, do with positive attitute,if you do that you are going to learn new things easy. Some people argue that in this life you dont need positive attitude, because they only think if you pay attention, do homework, and finish classwork in the school/ collage so you can be success in this life, they only think about to be responsible with their works, not about to have positive attitude. People also argue that in the works you dont need positive attitude, because the only thing you need is experience, work, and be resposible. In conclusion, if you do everything with positive attitude we can learn things more easy, and you are going to be success in this life, because you motivate yourself to do the best, also you can motivate people to do the same thing, to be success in this life, with positive attituded you can do everything, because you want to learn new things in this life.",6,5,5,6,4,5,908,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Although some people think that a positive attitude will not help a lot help a lot to be successful, actually that is not true. A positive attitude is the key to success because, we can always be out of stress and bad thoughts, we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen, and we can always have a good and friendly personality wich makes others to feel good about helping us and we can use their experiences in our lives. Here are some reasons that explain why a positive attitude is the key to success. the first reason, is we can always be out of stressand bad thoughts. For example, when we are in the bad situation and we dont know what to do, if we have a negative attitude you will be filled with bad thoughts and anxiety, we cant think properly and find the right solution. The second reason, is we can always have a high confidence about ourselves and for something good to happen. For example, if you are studying for our test, and if you have a high confidence and you are certain that you will pass the test, you will absolutely pass it. And last but not least the third reason, is we can always have a good and friendly peronality which helps others to feel good about helping us. For example, if we have a problem and we dont know how we can choose the right way to slove our problem, when we have a good and friendly peronality itll makes other people to feel good about helping us, and we can use our experiences in our lives.

In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country.

Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school. In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation. Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money. The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general. The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",8,7,9,9,7,8,1323,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

282,33,FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do. The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports. Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people. If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldnt be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student cant join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too. Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage. If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career.

285,2458,8E6F35BA3EE6,I agree what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote about. I agree with him because if you do the same thing you Mastered you will never grow but if you do more things and then you mastered you will grow a lot. You need to have a lot of experience and be on top of everything so you can grow. Ill give you a example if you have a concrete company that you mastered you will be okay. If you sell concrete and do Excavation and commercial your company can grow a lot and you will do more what you Mastered and can grow a lot from that. You need to have a lot of ideas and experiences what you are doing. If you think you can do something or achieve more do it because you can grow a lot from doing that. Its good to have experience and knowledge because everything can go away in seconds if you dont care of it. Its always good to do more what you Mastered in life. Its good to do more what you mastered so you can grow a lot. I really do agree with Emerson and what he wrote is so true. ,6,7,8,7,6,7,1890,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Nobody cant make you want you dont want to do life because its your life not theirs they cant tell you what you can do or not, like no youre the that can control you body, mind and life not them. The one person who has my back since I was kid and encourage me to keep from giving up in life is my older brother. My brother has taught me some many things that are good and what are bad in life. He told that I can live my life how I want it to live because nobody cant make your decisions what you want or not to do. He told me that he has gone through a lot things in the past like the people that he called as ""friends"" or ""family"" try to take advantage of him what he didnt want to things that they wanted him to do, so what he did was that is he spoke up to all the people that wanted to do this and that you cant tell him what to do or cant push me to doing things that he doesnt like. Then after all that he learned that he will never let the haters get into his head and take his life and use him like a toy, so he told me that is that if people try to do use you or say that cant be this in the future all you have to is do ignore everyone who tries to get in the way in the way of your life.

290,1044,51DA4BA94C7C,"The research study has shown that there are 25% of people thinks that trying same things over and over can never make you flourish in you life. Some people believed that you always have to try something new everyday, while other believed that they always want to work in something that they always flourished in. Although, doing what they know can make people feel confident but, its salient for us to flourish in our life, because you can learn new things to be successful, you can have more experience, you can also mastered in more things than you are in right now for more opportunity. First, trying new things can help you to be successful, sometimes you inserted that into your mind that you have never done that thing then,you end up saying that you cant do that, but never ever make that egregious decision in you life unless you never try you never going to know. For Example, a friend of mine named Generic_Name, once said that ""Try Try but dont Cry"" it means that dont ever think that you cant do it, you can and you can do it in better way than anyone else dont ever break your confident because of you nervous or for any other reason, but thats not how it works, you just need to fight through whatever reason you had. A myriad of people thinks that when they dont know what to do they always give up instead of trying, but its salient for all of us to put that confident into your mind. Also sometimes it can erroneous your feeling when nobody going to gives work to you because you never have done that work and also you refused to do it. Moreover, it is important for you to have more experience of everything than you have in order to flourish. Experience can make such a difference in what you have learn because it can prepares you from the beginning, so then you cant struggle any more in future, it can be harder at the beginning for some people, but it will get way more easier as you work through it in future. For Example, a student at Generic_school named Generic_Name had said that ""if I take classes that related to my career in high school it can make myself to be prepare for career in future."" It means that he can have a myriad of experience in high school since, he is a flourishing student, also he can learn and experience things very quickly, so then its easy for him when hell going to enter into his own career field. Hell not going to have that much trouble of being in that field like now a days other people have, and also Hell not going to be full of experience when he will go their or how it works, but he can learn basic things that he suppose to have in order to be in that career field. Lastly, you can mastered more than you are right now. If you mastered more their are more opportunity for you to get more scholarships. Scholarships can help you to graduated from high school with more credits and their are more chances for you to get accepted in collages. you can get to the collage that you really want to go into. There are myriad of collages that want you to be more intelligent and have mastered in everything because thats what they stand for since, it higher level of education they need, so its hard if you dont mastered more its not always like how you think that thats going happened sometime collages look for some staff that you never good at, so its important for all of us always be active. Its not fun to mastered more but sometimes you just have to make fun by working hard and putting you best effort into that work. In Conclusion, it is salient to all of us to be good and stay active in everything that we can, because you never know when that all stuff that you have experience on can help you so we just need to be prepare it can flourish your future life. Its better for you to try flourishing from beginning of everything you have to have little bit of experience about everything it can also open up your future door to get success.

Yes it is a good idea to start young because your already step ahead, you will have background knowledge about the career classes you choose and once you get older you wont have time to choose an career. Also taking courses in high school will help you choose your career like for an example academy classes. As a students taking a career course, will help them learn more about that career and you will have background knowledge about that career. for an example Im taking auto technology in highschol becuase I want to learn more about cars and how to fix them. after high school I will be going to a community college so I can learn an advance auto technology class and move on and thats Im going to succeed in life. Another reason why its a good idea for students to commit to a career at young age is becuase it will help students choose a good career that pays good money and the students will be a one step ahead. by doing this they will accomplish their goals. others may say that its not a good idea for students to commit a career at a young age becuase they think its waste of time however, its not waste of their time, becuase once your getting older you wont have time to choose an career that will last.

292,1175,C1BED9EF3630,"Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and, they are able to pick elective classes. Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they dont their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they dont get good grades. The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. In spite of that you still need to do your assignments at the same time but being not in a rush like the others. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesnt matter. The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they havent took before. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early dont have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you dont need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn. In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses. Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year.

Schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students cant make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them dont focus a lot on their studying and education. My first reason that the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldnt have a good future. Secondly, when the schools control the students involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes. The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future. Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not.

301,2765,88FD7FAAFA90,"Some school require students to complete summer projects. This is a great idea, and it would be better if the students would be able to pick the topic. One of the reasons is students know what interest them more. Second they would put more effort and time on the project. finally studenst inprove there skills when writing something they enjoy. To start with, summer projects should be student designed. Students should be able to pick their topic do to they know what interest them and what doesnt. For example, Generic_Name a student at Generic_School was given a project about sea animals. Generic_Name doesnt know nothing about marine animals and has no interest on the project. Therefor, Generic_Name has no idea what to say and its not in his interest. Furthermore, Generic_Name will be in summer break it would be less stressful to talk bout a topic he likes instead of a boring one the teacher would give out. Also the students would put more effort and time to the project. Secondly, by the student knowing what he likes and his strength theyll aim for that A on the project. Students alfound do poorly on school project due to the topic they were given. For example, Generic_Name was given the topic to right about sports Generic_Name. Generic_Name has never done sports her self so there she has no interest on it. Generic_Name will do the project and get finished on time but, did not put time and effort to do her best. Undoubtedly, students do better on a topic they all feel good about. Finally the students will enjoy doing the project. Statistics show that when students write about something they like, they tend to improve in both reading and writing skills. For example, Generic_Name was able to right about a topic she likes, therefor, she enjoyed writing and improved her skills in reading and writing. Generic_Name enjoyed doing this project that she added more information about the topic. undauntedly, students summer project should be student designed. Despite this valid reasons there are does who think teacher should pick the topic. How ever they are wrong. Because students should be able to enjoy writing, and with the prompts the teacher gives out they just get stress out. Unquestibily, summer projects should be studenst desinged. To close up studenst will gain knolege and enjoy writing. They will aslo do better in the project do to is in there best interest. And finally a summer project should be fun not boring.

Then after they change the menu all the student will see all the change and they start to comment about how is the menu, of course it will a percent of students they will be not agree about the food, thats why i recommend the principal will do a session for student to start to vote what kind of food they want in their menu. I recommend these for the principal to listen all the opinion are students said, when the menu change we dont got any issue or complain from student because that will affect the change of the menu because the principal take the decison in him self.

303,1581,B54DBEF87F11,"One day Generic_Namehad to go somewhere important with his family, but the problem was that he also had school to attend to. So he decided to do a video chat with his class, so he didnt he didnt have to miss anything from school. Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them. First reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they have responsibilities. What if you get sick and dont want to miss anything then you can just video chat with the class. Your familiy decide to take a trip somewhere on a school week what do you do. You take your school stuff with you and a laptop to talk with the class. You cant miss more than like 9 days of schoo if you do you automatically fail, and thats your biggest responsibility on not failing, so you can take the advantage of video chatting with your class. Those are the reasons why I say students should do a video confrence because they have responsibilities. Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year thats when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or dont have a ride and you cant get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you dont understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you dont feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who dont know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them. Lastly, some people dont want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they dont want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they dont do anything because they think that they dont have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they wont miss that much work. Thats why you should either do online stuff or a video confrence with your classes so you dont miss anything or be left behind. Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. There are many reasons why students should take the benificial of doing stuff like that because they have responsibilities and also have a future ahead of them.

305,2902,1D47271C213D,"The students must be self- confident in order to succeed. I agree that hard work helps to build self-esteems because students must have faith in their own abilities, they have to learn from their mistakes, and be proud of them achievements. Thats why students can not be conform with insufficient work just to be admired by teachers or parents. Also, to able to be successful always needs high standards. Even though, parents and teachers decide to praise the students by giving them gifts or other things. It can motivate the students but there is some days were people are not in a good mood and forget to praised the students. Thats how students cant continue with the same motivation and loose confidence. For example, my Probability Statistics math class she used to gave us candy every single day so we never try to do our classwork, everybody failed her class. Several students make mistakes while they are trying to accomplishing something and they give up when they dont have an easy solution. In reality that is when they are used to be treated with extreme indulgence. Of course, it doesnt matter how many mistake they make; it matters to continue believing in them self. Eventually, my friend Generic_Name came from Generic_City, she used to go to Susbury University it was difficult for her to learn English she also failed three classes. But she did not care how many times she failed. She believe in herself and she achieved her goal now she is an ESL teacher. How does people becomes doctors or professionals? some people dont have their parents alive or they are far away from each other so they dont have nobody to praised them. From my opinion, they should be proud of them self. All the effort, dedication, passion for the school and they dont need somebody to award them to be trust. But also, its not easy for the students to succeed in this world unless they want to work for it. Everybody can notice when they gain something beneficial for their life and be satisfied with them great effort. From my own experience, my biology teacher it was very strict that she screamed at my face the first day of the semester but I showed her that Im better what she thought I was. So I passed her class with an average of 80 and I also passed the SOL. Finally, when the students are comfortable from what they already accomplished, its when they have a great opportunity to build them self-esteems. They do not need to be pushed with emotional things to able to be confident, If they get emotional later on, they wouldnt be able to continue without being praised. Some people do not survive when they dont get to achieved, then they complain on someone who dont give presents. Self-esteems always comes from achievements never comes from praising.

309,1732,F5817C081342,"Is a positive attitude key to success? Well, In my opinion I strongly agree, I believe a positive attitude will take you far in life and will let you accomplish many goals youve set for yourself. For instance having a positive attitude doesnt just affect you but it also affects others in a negative or positive way, for example motivation; you could motivate someone and inspire them just by doing you and accomplishing youre goals or you could even brighten somebodies day up by doing small gestures. In the other hand there will be people that dont want too see you do good, people that want to bring you down and people that have envy over you. That shouldnt bring you down that should be more motivation to do better because those are people who are jealous, people that are jealous of something you have and that they dont have. There are people who have started from the bottom with very little and are now doing big things, by having a positive mind set and believing in themselves. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people. In my experience a positive attitude is a key to success, why? Well, when I was younger I had a difficult time with the English language because I only spoke Spanish at the time, which then resulted that I had to repeat a grade. Being left behind made me feel dumb and stupid, I also felt embarrassed; embarrassed of saying my age to the other kids when they would ask how old I was, I thought they would make fun of me and call me names. Through out the years I got more mature and I didnt really care no more about my age, I then found out that there were other kids that were in the same situation as me, which made me feel better about myself after. When I got to high school I met my case manager, he was and still is a really nice guy and really cares about the students. When I met him he asked me many questions one of them was how old I was when I told him he was surprised because I was older then the other students. He then asked why I was 16 years old with freshmen classes, I told him why and he understood. A few days pasted by and he asked me how I felt being behind the sophomore class, I told him I didnt like it and how I felt a little dumb. He then told me how I would feel about graduating with that class, I then knew what he was about to tell me and I liked the idea of it. He told me I could do three years but I would have to do two years in one, I didnt care if it would be more work all I was thinking of was graduating on time. So, of course I accepted and now I am here taking my writing SOL with my positive attitude! If I didnt have a positive attitude I wouldnt be here right now, and for sure I wouldnt be graduating in May of 2020. Im very happy and thankful that I have this opportunity, and I know I will make it through this school year if I believe in my self. The other night I was going through my Facebook feed and I stumbled upon a link that one of my friends re-post, on that link there was an article of a women that is from El Salvador, and that women use to live near to where we used to live. On that article it said ""First women Pilot from El Salvador"" when I first read it I could not believe what I was reading, I was very happy for her and I know she worked so hard to get to where shes at. It is incredible knowing a women from a country that does not have much to give is now flying in the air going around the world. Reading that article motivated me to set goals for my self and to keep on going, if she can accomplish her dream I can to. I admire my mother, shes gone through so much and has risked her life to have a better one, not just for her but also for her family that she had to leave behind. Before she came to the United States her mother didnt want her to come she thought it was to much of a risk. My mom knew what she was getting her self into she believed everything would come out fine, the day my aunt was about to leave to Mexico my mother begged her to take her. My aunt would deny and deny her until she finally said yes. My mom packed up her stuff and left with my aunt behind her mothers back, but before she left she left a note for her mother saying if she doesnt leave now theyll never have a better future. My mother has walked thousands of miles and has nearly starved to death to get to where she is now. She worked her head off trying to make enough money to support her family, she had three jobs and as soon as she clocked out of one she would walk miles to get to the other one. Years later my grandma got her Visa and was able to come visit, she regretted doubting her and apologized for not believing in her. If my mom didnt have a positive mind set and if she listened to my grandma she would still be in El Salvador; washing her clothes in the river, eating beans and eggs everyday, and earning six dollars a day. She has a better life now then she had before, but she still has more to accomplish and I am here to help her. With her positively she can go far. Therefore a positive attitude is the key to success, negativity wont take you anywhere all it does is let you watch others have fun while they enjoy life. Positivity allows you to set goals and to accomplish them. Many people have met their goal by believing in them selves, no matter how difficult it is they keep on pushing. I believe attitude does have an impact on life choices, if you put no effort on a task your set to do, that task will never be done or itll turn out horribly. A positive attitude is the key to success all you need is to believe in yourself, have patience, and ignore all the ignorant people.

Etheir working as a group or not you are still getting work done, and learning as you go. When I state that you can ""learn"" it means that you can find out things especially as a group where everyone has theyre own ideas and facts about topics. Some people just take working as a group as an advantage to just copy and get answers just to get things done. Copying others does not help you learn anything other then getting your work completed. I think it is better working alone beacuse it would be better for me to learn. Yes, id probably take a long time getting it done just because I would be taking my time finding little details. Some people choose not to work independently but I do. One reason why I think it is better to work alone is because of the fact that after your done youll feel relieved and happy. If you did what you had to do alone without anybodys help besides the person who gave you the assignment, or job whatever than you done a good job just by doing your work independently. Working as a group isnt bad I just suggest it should be better for students or anyone to work idependently also to learn what their doing instead of just getting it done when you can learn and get it done. Some people end up just copying off someone else to get stuff done. Others they actually do it and share with others who actually also have stuff done to share. Not everyone copies, nor cheats just alot of people such as students take working as a group an advantage to copy. Working together as a group can be much more easier than alone but still working independently is much more helpful for your learning benifits. Anyone who is not used to doing independent work gets a little kick on working alone because their so used to working as a group. It helps people push them selves on finding more details, facts, and clues for what they need. If you do struggle of course you can obvisouly ask a teacher or anyone for a hand in help because you could be stuck on something. You can focus more on your work while your alone because if your in a group working it gets you distracted. If you hear other students or people talking to you, and the rest of the group giving each other ideas while your focued to find your own ideas gets you to unfocused. Somebody elses ideas in the group could be wrong, and when you write them and use those ideas you could be wrong as well. People usually rely on others to get answers which is not right. Also its hard for others to communicate with others as a group which it also makes it better for anyone to work alone. You could do things your own way while working independently. All of the things I wrote about help show that it is better to work independently than with others in a group.

But staying occupied is the way to go if you wanna be successful and achieve things in life. Sitting around and doing nothing wont lead you to anything sucessful in life. If your at home sitting around having nothing to do will not help you to be successful. If you try to find something productive to do it will help you in the future. To be productive or to do something productive really doesnt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community. Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate. On the other hand if your used to doing your work the same day its assigned and or turn it in on time you are less likely to procasanate because you are used to staying occupied and doing all your work.

Staying on track can help people focus. Some students from my school today lose track and end up not doing their work. Later on students fell unaccomplished from not doing the work and not accomplish anything. If students can focus and stay on track they can achieve more. By showing effort and working hard people can accomplish more. My mother works hard in the hot sun to accomplish her goals. My mothers goals are to work hard so she could pay bills, make sure her kids have what they need, and food on the table for her kids.

Getting thing done is reaching for accomplishment and later on be an achievement.

313,1558,A1D0490FD324,"I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools. Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common. At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. For example, In history there are students that dont understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. When we took our test we both got As. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher. During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others cant see.

They have schoolwork, homework, extracurricular and maybe work, all these things make a students life stressful so it is important that they get a break every once in a while. I believe that students should get a long summer break, instead of a year-round school year, because, firstly, there are other activities that can be done during the summer that keep students minds active, secondly their health is at risk and lastly, summer break is beneficial to school staff as well. From time to time, people need to get a break from their day-today life they need to take a moment to relax and enjoy their life and maybe discover an interest that they may have. Although school is important and necessary for success later on in life, so are outside experiences that can contribute to the development of a students real life skills. During summer break there are multiple activities that can be done in order to keep a students mind active, whether it may be sports, summer camps, summer jobs etc. All these activities allow for their minds and bodies to stay active. Eventhough, they are not keeping their brains engaged in terms of school work and studying they are exposing themselves to new activities that might require them to think critically, open-mindedly and collaboratively; which I feel is essential for real life. For example, a student might be at summer camp and they are put in a group with four strangers and are given a challenging task that requires them to collaborate with the other member of the group, critically analyzing the situation and coming up with solutions and be open-minded to listening and trying to understand the perspectives of their peers. This also reflects their environment in school therefore, it can be said that they are keeping their minds active while outside of school. Although, not all students might be involved in activities outside of school, some are taking a break from the stress of life itself. Due to all the demands in their life during the school year summer break is a good way to take a breather and take care of themselves mentally. Depression has been very common in teenagers in recent years, and although it may not be entirely due to the stress of school, school does contribute to the detirriation of their mental health. In addition, over-working ones self has negative impacts overall whether they are depressed or not. Too much stress in ones life can have negative effects on their health overall. High blood pressure, hypertension, severe weight loss are a few examples of the effects stress. Furthermore, when stressed our body releases a neurotransmitter called Cortisol, this neurotransmitter in excess can impair a persons thinking and reaction time; which is very important for students as they are required to think in order to complete school work and homework, therefore, if they dont take breaks their grades are probably going to drop due to their inability to think effectively, further contributing to their detirriating mental health. Lastly, summer break is and essential time for everyone that is involved in schools, such as teachers, administrators, councilors etc. Although schools are intended to educate students, its the school staff that make this possible. This is why we need to give our school staff a break because all the points I stated above also applies to them. In addition, with a long summer break teachers are able to have more time to thoroughly think about their lesson plans for their students as well as have an extended amount of time to live their lives and enjoy time with their family and friends, after all, teachers are humans too and they need to be able to life their lives and forget that they are required to do so much for such little pay. To emphasize further, I believe that schools should give students a long summer break instead of a year-round school year because a students mind will stay active during the summer through various activities that require students to think open-mindedly, critically and collaboratively. Also, students need a break in order to de-stress for the sake of their health mentally and physically. Lastly, a long summer break is needed for school staff as well because they also need to take a break, as well as the students.

If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that. I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then youll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and youll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that youll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place. Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, its scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine. Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,its werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People wont take you seriosly. And if they dont take you like you mean business,then they just wont talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing. In conculsion,I dont think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people wont judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%.

Some kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring.

We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime Many student dont like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I dont think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they dont pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life. Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable.

324,1587,C928D32FE5C5,"Are vacations a necessity to us and to our success? Why do we need them? While some say that inactivity gives us time to reinvent ourselves. Others believe that it instigates procrastination. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up and it allows us time for new ideas. Inactivity serves a purpose because it keeps us from giving up. For example, I was once taking a very long test that lasted around 4 to 5 hours. At first, I was just guessing my way through it because I was very tired and ready to give up. Then, we were given a five minute break so I got up and walked around a bit. After walking for a few minutes, I was energized and ready to finish the test. With my new found energy, I was very content with the test and my score. In fact, students who take mental breaks during long testing periods score 31% higher than the ones who did not take any breaks. In conclusion, inactivity keeps us enthusiastic about our work. Inactivity serves a purpose because it allows us time for new ideas. For example, one of my friends named Generic_Name once did not go to school for three days. During these three days, she organized her school essentials and cleaned up her room. Since she was working on a project before the break, she had time to finish it and she even had another project idea for her science class. She obtained a good grade on both projects. In fact, students who have taken breaks during long tests, like the SOL, say that after their break they had a better understanding of the test. Even the workforce workers are encouraged to take a few days off. It helps the worker get more creative. Even the owner of a business need a vacation. In fact, around 56% of entrepreneurs say that they came up with at least one new idea after a vacation. Inactivity helps prepare our minds for when we are active. Inactivity serves a purpose. Inactivity keeps us from throwing in the towel. it gives us a mental break; which, creates time for new ideas. Some believe that inactivity encourages laziness. However, it gives us time to rejuvenate our attitude and our mindset. If we take more breaks, to let our mind wonder, we would be more effective in anything it is we are doing.

Either their were problems with my camera or with my lighting just problems that I didnt know how to function well enough.

Thats why failure is a key part to success, if you dont learn from your mistakes how will you learn. For example, when I was in middle school my teacher always picked on me in class the reason behind it was because I didnt play my instrument the right way.

You are your own person you just dont know how to be yourself or you think they wont approve of you,So now you probably think if you do what other people do and act like them you will think your getting notice by other people that makes you feel good and you continue to do so. So you lost yourself and cant even recognize yourself because you went to far now you cant even choices what you wanna do because people expect that from you now you let them choice your own life. They have power you dont control yourself they do you let people get the best from you and you let them have it because you didnt want to be weird and now things you aint always easy so now you gotta live with it. Trying to impress someone isnt you,its just wrong influences make you do anything you pick from good or bad and it goes one way you decide if you want that for you not what other people think and how they can get to you so quick that you do it and it all goes down hill from there. Make your future about what you think is best for you and only you stop making it what you what other people to view you as do you. Influences may get you places but are they the right ones though or is it something i just want you to hear. Making the right choice is great you decide what your gonna do,how your gonna live your life,and be yourself,But choice tp make the wrong choice and now people control you they get to what they want because they went for it and you cant get it back any more. People like to make a little stop for themselves inside your head so they can persuade you into anything and get what they want so they do by telling you this is the greatest thing every its the most amazing thing i did. Dont be fooled by that its all in your head you want to fit in i get it but dont take it to far where even your own close people tell you that you have change .So many things are gonna be asked from you and not even you will know how to answer because you let other people control you and talk for you that it became a things that you cant even get out of. Its better if you just stay in your lane and go for the good influences and not the bad type you create your own story not other people. Wrong to right is always the choice being a good influence is great you teach people the right way not the bad type. So many people choose bad and not good they want to fit in so bad thats its going bad for them picking the good is always right. You dont need to impress people when you got yourself and no shame for you just do what is asked and make a great thing happen. Right chooses bring you more things in life then bad getting good people in your life is always the answer a good influence can get you to a lot of things in life and you wont even notice in till it has happened. A chance to pick a good life then a bad one ill take it bad influences bring you no where its a joke if you pick the wrong influence make a good pick. So yes creating your own life is better and deciding on good influence then to have a life that will bring hell on you, yes i will always do so. Good infleuence is always the answer not things wrong about that and will always be my choice for you be the right infleunce that other need to hear from you speak up do whats right for you and yourself make a better you and let other people hear you speak you bring goood things into others peoples life not just yours.

330,89,7F21F77E9AA3,"Big Responsibility Young Age In most common societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they ending high school but in some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter school. What is the best? Well figure out. Is not a easy thing to do, decision the most difficult thing to do in life and even more when your young. Trying to know what a person want at young age it must be difficult, everybody pretend that you must know what you want at young age when you always have get everything by your parents, grand parents, aunt, uncle or tutor. You cant know what you want to do in your life even if you havent live by your self. I dont think its a good idea for students to star stressing them just when they have enter to school because school can be hard some times even if its your first year at high school even if you are smart, so I dont think that could work making a student stressing at young age. Student have to do other stuff not only thinking about careers they want to take, students have to do homework, some students have to help their parents and get a job to help them some students love to do sport. Students also need help and time to know what they want for the rest of their life. Young people have to do it carefully because their future depends on their decisions on the present. Its hard for a students to decide what they want for they life for instance when I was at 9 grade my parents told me, if you dont know what career you want to take its fine you have 4 years to decide. When my parents told me this I felt so peaceful and relax because I had time to see what career I want to take and I had time to get information about careers that were interesting for me. And I could do better at school because I didnt have to keep thinking about careers that I want for my life because I could do that in my free time. In conclusion if a student its a really young age let them think what they want not only because its at young age its also because they going to pick something that its for the rest of their life. Not easy for a young boy or girl to know what they going to decide to do for the rest of their life, specifically when they havent discovered what life is like. The only way that you could decide what career you want being a early age its with help of God.",7,6,7,8,5,7,1676,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

333,150,60CCF0F2DF38,"Dear Winston Churchill, I strongly believe that, failure plays a huge role in pursuing success, and I have a personal story and also information to back up my statement ""that failing is the key to success"". The news article of daily life, had a section dedicated to failing is a key to success, in that portion it talks about how the most successful people in the world had to fail so many times and hardship in that portion of the article it interviews Bill Gates and he quote on quote said that ""failing thought me that you have to try harder and harder every time you fail in order to successed"", and without failing he would not be the CEO of Google. I personally have experienced how failing is the key to success. I started playing football in my freshman year in high school. I was trying so hard to get a starting position on the football team. I was doing really bad during team practice, and one day my coach came up to me and told me that I should quit football, and how it was not the right sport for me. So I got cut from the team but I did not listen to what my coach said to me. I kept practicing over the off season working harder then ever. When sophomore season came up and we had to go through tryouts in order to make the team. I was doing really good in the first two days of the tryouts but then I started doing really bad on the third day, and then the coach came up to me on the last day of the tryouts, and told me that I did not make the team. I started feeling really hopeless but I still did not gave up and kept working harder and harder. On my junior season it was time for the football tryouts once again. I started doing really good, and the coaches were really impressed of what I was capable of doing. Last day of the tryouts the coach came up to me, and told me that he was really proud of me. He was really surprised that I didnt gave up, and after that he told me I made the team as a starting defensive tackle. In conclusion this is why I strongly agree that failing is a key to success, without failure we as human beings would not be able to improve in our day to day life. It is because of failing which keeps us successful, and makes us humans work harder for what we want in life.

334,753,F075F9AD2AA4,"Do you think it is a good idea for the students to commit to a career at youg age? That is a good idea because the school will give the opportunity to know more things. Also, is a bad idea because some students have a lot of things to do after school, they have responsabilities example; they have to work, they have to do things in their house, or many things what a young can do. I choose students have to take the career at a young age because: They will be ready when they have to work in that career, if they going to take the careers that they prefer it is going to be good, because they will practice and they will learn a lot in of that ,so they will focuse everyday in that career. The most important is they wont have any problems when they have to show everything what they learn after they did finish their career. It is a good idea because is not bad that in some societies the students has to expected to identify a career by the hight school, because about that form the people can know what is his/her specialty, or what work realized in the high school ,if that person was good or bad in that career. Is good that person know what he/she wants to be in the future, because some people dont know what they want to be, what is their dreams when they become adult ,but some people know what they want to be ,and what is their dream job. Is very important to know that you want to be sure about your future because this opportunities are not in every where we have to exploit the things the life give us, because when I was a little girl my dad alwas plead me that I enter a couses like English, computation,to play guitar, dance, and many things ,but I always respond no ,because I just wanted to play and that set , but now I know the importance to learn ,to know ,to make something ,and show to the world that you know that you can do that ,and nonthing in this world is impossible. They will have the capacity to learn more things about the careers what they will going to choose. Also, the school will give them the opportunity to work in the summer or after school, this idea is amazing because in others countries like my country there are not career to choose in the schools ,the student are not ready or they are not ability to work in something because they dont practice nothing in the shool they dont know anything .They just study and dont have elective courses that ways, the student in my country dont work usualy the parent are who work. The conclution is that the students have to take some career ,bacause is very important for the societies also for them, they will be capacity to know many things. Also, they will be ready to make the work what they choose in the hight school. And the student wont have complication or doubt to may complete their job. Finaly, the students will have a profession in something that they can make very well, but this courses is not just to show to the others persons the career that you took in the high school. This career is for you ,for your future more forward. What happen if you can process with your study, this courses is an advantage in your live.

335,1820,5241864FBC48,"My Grandma always use to say that ""working with a group is fun and all, but at the end of the day, I would have to understand what the group activity was about, but at the same time working with a group can get more work done and we help each other."" She explained to me that there isnt group work when it comes down to taking a test or quiz. Students are always sitting down and learning maybe getting up and working with a couple of classmates can help learn too. Im the one in a seat answering the questions on a test or quiz. There is no group work involved when it comes down to that. I think working alone and working as a group can both be beneficial. First when working in a group I can understand my classmates more than my teacher. I can understand more especially if a student just like me explains everything. I might not understand somethings or tend to forget, however someone in my group could know or refresh my memory by giving me notes, or vise versa. I can get a ton of work done as a group, but do I really understand what I just did. For example, say we have a group of five students, three of them are constantly talking, the other two students are the only ones in the group that are actually doing the work. The grade that the group received was a 95. If the students are quizzed on what they have just completed, the students that were talkative are most likely to get a lower grade than the two students that were actually doing the activity without getting off topic. Second when working alone there are no distractions. I would get my work done peacefully, at a rate I would like to go. I would not get as much work done as if I was in a group, but the teacher would know that its all my work. For example, say Im working with a group, we get a 93 for the whole group work. I received a quiz on what we just did and I got a 78. After that performance, the teacher gave me notes and went over the same material with me. I studied; and I took the quiz again. This time I got a 90. Therefor, this goes to show that working alone helps the teacher figure out what you need help on. Some people say that working in a group can cause fights,distractions, and poor quality work ethic. I feel like working alone is more beneficial. Everything can not be done in a group. Sometimes you have to work alone to fully grasp the subject. Working alone lets your brain process better especially at its own rate. The teacher can really see what you need help on. In conclusion, I think that both working in a group and working alone are beneficial. I think that working alone is more beneficial because everyone works and really understands the subject at a different pace. Working in a group does not show the teacher a specific persons work. Thats why I think working alone can better help yourself and is more beneficial. ",8,8,8,9,9,9,1074,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Because with that theyre showing someone who is not themselves. And the most stupid thing is when they show some love to their country and apparent like nothing happen. That means being doble face. I do not like that kind of people. However, thats no the only thing. People start to follow what someone else say.

Finally its not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad. Kind isnt always the best choice. First being kind isnt always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help. Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around its easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school. Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering. Dont be kind to those who arent good people First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore dont talk to them and shouldnt be kind to them. Also a reason to not be kind to those who arent good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right.

If they have good grades they will get a good job later in their lives. Creativity is less important than knowledge because knowledge will help in life.

If the problem is fixed everything comes back to normal. If there is a family problem someone will manage to fix it. When everything is fix everything is going back to normal. Knowledge is more important than creativity because knowledge will help to find solution. Doing better at school, getting a job easily, and finding solution to problems are way that knowledge is more important than creativity. Without knowledge humans will not be able to do anything.

346,1098,8C01B86DE888,"Homework Clubs Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills. First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didnt really do my homework and I knew that I didnt make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didnt like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded. Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done. Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didnt know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didnt need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didnt know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way. I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",9,7,8,7,7,9,1859,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
347,2673,6B479AF72202,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote,to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Although some people disagree about Emersons statement, actually I agree because society is always trying to make people change their point of view, their culture, their belivers. First never give up, Second always love and be proud of yourself and Third dont forgot your roots. Here are some reasons why I agree with Emersons statement. First, the world is trying to make change but you have to never have to give up. Becuase its important to continue being yourself, not matter if some people are not going to like it, the only one who have to feel comfortable with yourself its you. Second, always love and be proud of yourself. Its important to be proud of who you are because eventhough you make mistakes sometimes that doesnt have to make change who you are. You just have to learn from your mistakes, I know it is difficult but no one says that would be easy ,but you can do it. Love yourself because every of your features, your character and your personality is what identify you, is make you unique, different from anyone else in the world that wants you to fit on it. Third, dont forgot your roots. If you are from another country you are forced to change yourself, trying to pretend that you are someting else, but you must have to stop it. Because in a world that is constantly trying to make you be something else your biggest accomplisment is to show that you are better than what they expected you to be. Finally what are you waiting for!. Dont let the world change yourself, remember to never give up always fight for is better for you, love and be proud of yourself always and dont forgot your roots because every part of yourself is what make you unique, special and that is your greastest accomplisment.",5,6,6,6,6,6,1394,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

349,508,7333B4549006,"Conserving energy and resources is very benifical for human life and nature. Human damage many nature things while making energy and resources for their daily use. For example deforestation, use of water to make electricity, which can decrease the ammount of aquatic animals and water on the earth. Some buisness have adopted the idea of a four-day work week so they can conserve energy and resources. A four-day work week can also effect on thier buisness and put them in loss but it depends on them how they manage their work in four days. But Should schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours and make a four day school week? In my opinion school shouldnt follow this model. students already have five- day school week which sometime seems very short, when students have lot of work to do and they need more help of teachers. In a month there are some federal holidays in weekdays, Which make a five- day school week more short. Extending the school day two hour and adopted a four-day work week have many disadavtages. It can put bad impact on students study and on thier grades, they will spend their weekend more with friends not with books, Students may spend their times on computer games and on phones. So, four-day school week will effect somewhere in student life. Its better to keep the five-days school week for students goods and for their better education. Every student study hard in school to get better grades in all classes. Students always try to learn more from their teachers and do their best in class. But a short week can a put bad impact on their study and their grades will go down. For example when students have an extra time in their classes, they mostly spend it with thier teachers and asking them questions so they can get answers in a specific way. But what if they dont have time in class or teachers dont have time for students. If a teacher has a short time to teach soemthing. They will teach in a very fast or a different way to students. Some students may not get everything in class, and their class performance will go down and it impact on their grades. Its very important for a teacher to spend a time with their students and ask them about their problems in classes, and also for a students its very important to share their problems with teacher so, they can find a way to solve the problems. It can only happens when student and teacher both have time in class to discuss. so the Four-day week can make a distance between a teacher and a student. Second, Friendship is a very important thing in every person life, Friendship with a good friend can tell you the path of your success. Spending time with friends is a good habbit. But it doesnt mean that you have to spend you al free time with friends. Almost every studnt spend their weekends with their freinds and they dont care about school study. Even we spend our one school holidays with friends and forget about study. what if we have three days off in a week. Do we spend that time with our books? the answers is no we cannot spend time with books on weekends. We need to spend our times with books and the schhol is the only place where we can learn something and soend times with the books. For example Last week we had an five days off from school and i didnt study in that week and i forgot to complete an project i got bad grades on that class. i spent my time with my friends and i didnt know the meaning of study in that time thats why i got bad grade in that class. But when i have regular week of school i always complete my work first so i can keep my grades up. More school holidays will give more tension to student thats why they didnt study at home and they would like to study at school. A regular school week is much better than four-day week of school because in a one day we can learn a lot from our teachers at school. In this century every single person is using technology. Students are using more technolgy than others, spending time on computer and on phones isnt bad thing but you also have to spend some time with other activites like sports, cultural activites. But children doesnt want to do this and they play games on phones and on computers. For exaample I have a younger whos fourteen year old. Whenever he arrived at home from school, the first thing he do is get out his Laptop from his school bag and start playing games with his friends on online group so you can easily estimate that how many school student playing that game on computer and on phones on weekends and on off days. Playing game on wekends and on holidays can effect you and your studies and gives you a bad grades. Its better to be in school than on computer games, so we can learn something new. A four-day school week can make a big difference in students school life. At the end, I would say that if school will follow the model by extending school and a four-day school week. It can develop a big difference in student education. Students come to school for learning, sometime they get bored from school. But if school make this rule for student the student will be happy with this but in future they will understand that how wrong it is to make a school week shorter without getting anything and just stayed at home. From more school hours and with regular days student can learn something more and keep their grades up. They will spend their more times with books and paying attention on the study not games or electronic. So the Four-day schhol week will not work for the school it may only work for the buisness but not for the school.

350,365,9DCB91B1F18D,"I think that students should take a art, muisc, and drama class. Cause by taking these classes they can learn more about what happens ineach classes. Also, if they do one of those classes they can recive credits on their GPA. First reasoon, student can learn what happens in that class like art. Art is a great elective class because tehy can have more credits and they can learn more interesting things in that class. Also, art can do things for the student because while time pass and they are great in drawing it could take him or her to collage it could make better digree collage. For example, if you also can be in a art contest in your school or anywhere else. Secondly, students can do these classes. However, music is also a great elective class because it could help you like in school and anywhere else because they know how you sing. But, music is not only singing students can also play insterment like giutar, flut and many more. So, student can also impress them with insterment. Also, it helps with credits by it could take them to a different better collage. Lastly, these classes are better to take as an elective class because they can perform in events in school like drama. Drama is a great elective class because students get to move around and have fun and dance. Also, they can do it on their free time and as their elective class. For example, students can impress their family with their amzaning talent. Also, with their talent they can go to different countriesand perform their and other places too and preform too. In clousion, this is why students should take art, music, drama as their elective class. That ways they can get credits for doing these classes. imrove with their talents and go around the world.

351,1431,0943E322C195,To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather then working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having disscustions with the group. There are many reasons why i prefer working with a group and im hear to share with you. Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didnt know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same intrest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another. In my opinion working with a group is more simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enojy learning that way. One small little problem about working with a group is having disscustions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also argree with each other . The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didnt like and would have a argument. There are more pros then cons in working with a group for sure . Everyone has a different saying if its beneficial to either work with a group or work alone . Im not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contrarie its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got asand with and you just wanna do your work alone. Working in a group though brings you toghter as a school and theres nothing better then working in a team.,6,7,8,8,8,6,123,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
352,937,E03B0AA78E40,"Committing to a job at a Young age is bad and good idea, why you may ask? Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. When youre older youll be an expert and know the job by memory. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you dont really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. Your brain also isnt fully developed until youre older it is a proven fact. Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasnt really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age. Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. The more you get older the more you know about the job so youll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. There for you wouldnt be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically. As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. Itll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable. ""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isnt fully developed at a young age. That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example lets say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school years once you graduate youll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you shouldnt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate.

354,2083,62102D1B1A52,"Do you agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? If the statement about the role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, it could help people to do better things. People can have a better future. Also people can feel more positive. First, people can do better things. For example, my cousin Generic_Name had a soccer game at Generic_City, she and her team was talking about how they will need to play on the field, they needed to play better than the other games because the team that she was going to play against is one of the best teams that plays on that field and also her team needed to have more goals scores to keep being on the list so the can win the championship, so when they started to play they was playing like they planned it before the game and at the end of the game they won and everyone was happy because they never thought that they was going to have the chance to win that team, but they never give up. Next, people can have a better future. For example, my parents after they got married they always wanted to have a better future for them and for all there kids they was going to have, so both of them was planning to cross the board from Mexico to the United States, so after a week they finally cross the board and they was living with my grandma, when my dad started working after a couple of months my dad bought a new house and they started to live there, then they were saving money to buy more stuffs because they was going to need to buy a lot of things like: beds, clothes, shoes, table, chairs, etc. After some years they finally got everything they needed and they had two kids and finally got to know that they will have a better future. Last, people can feel more positive. For example, when my cousin talk to her coach about that I wanted to be in a team of soccer, the coach called me and told me that he wanted me to play soccer with his team the next weekend, but before that I told him that I was not that good at playing soccer and he told me that I will learn easier and faster if I go to practices, so when I went to my first game I was so nervous about that I was not going to play good as the other girls do, and I did not wanted them feel bad if we lose for my fault, but I kept playing and I never thought that at my first game I was going to make a goal, but overall I kept going from failure to failure and never loss my enthusiasm and that is one of the reasons that helped me feel more positive of myself. In conclusion, I believe that going to failure to failure will not loss the enthusiasm, at the same time it could be one of the betters reasons by making people do things better, make people have a better future, and also people can feel positive by them self.",6,5,6,6,4,6,1278,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
355,919,E11139259D4E,"Students have enough hours of school already! I strongly disagree about the school board adding more hours to school every day. Im not telling you this just because Im a student, Im telling you this because It doesnt just affect me, It affects other students in many ways too! This could bring students really bad behaviors, because they get tired of being in the same place for a long period of time. This could bring students grades down too, because students do not work the same when they are tired. If they added more hours to school, students wouldnt have time to do their homework or to study for quizzes and tests. This idea of adding hours to school does not just affect students, it brings problems to the teachers and the school. Teachers have families and some of them have children of their own, this wouldnt let teachers to go home and pass time with their family. Another problem I see in this Its that some students have appointments, Just like me ! Sometimes I have to go to my orthodontist, and my appointments are always in the morning, I have to go there every month. I always miss two or three classes, and when I get there I have A bunch of work that I missed! If they dint add those hours to school I could ask my orthodontist to do my appointments in the afternoon. Sometimes students get sick, and if they miss one day of school they would have to do more work than the usual. This affects the school in many ways too! The school would have to pay more, because they would have to give the students more food than the usual. They would have to waste more money in paper, bathroom supplies and they would have to give the student a new agenda with more bathroom passes in it. the school would have to manage more conflicts and fights between the students. If they added one and a half hours to school they would create more car crashes and accidents in the roads, because the students would get out of school at the same time that elementary school students do, and then there would be a lot of school buses. Students wake up pretty early, at least thats what I do. If the school added more hours they would get more than tired, the student wouldnt even learn the lessons or the teacher wouldnt even teach the lessons right. As you can see I listed many ways that adding hours to school affects students,teachers and the school. I think the school board should rethink this new idea they came up with. i think that they should hear other students points of view. I think Im not the only student that thinks that this is not a good idea because it affects everyone. And some other students think different from others. In conclusion I think that the school board shouldnt add more hours of school because of the different consequences it gives to the students, teachers and the school. And it not just gets the students tired but they wouldnt learn the subjects like they normally do in class. Teachers are affected by this decision too, because they get more tired and they get mad at students easier. This could create big conflicts between people in school and it could bring the school more problems than the usual, like more fights and they would have to give students more breaks.

356,1673,5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldnt be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend. To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information. Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school. Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend.

Working alone is good because you could think of ideas that some students cant think about. For example,working alone can get you a better high score in the class then working in groups. Another example is when your working in groups it can cause you to not finish the work you started because your either talking or not focused in what your supposed to do. In some cases some students like working alone because they get to turn in there work on time so they dont have to fail the class. Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they dont need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work. Students often dont really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 dont do anything. Students sometimes dont even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students dont like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so its best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups.

Like I said I will like to be honest with others so they can know how I feel about stuff or how I feel in my own way. Im not trying to be mean if im honest, Im just letting it go how I feel. But dont just go to others and say how you feel about them because that is just really disrespectful. Its good to be honest to your parents because they have always been there for you. Be honest with your friends, they are like siblings to you, they wont judge. Be honest with the people you trust or see them hurt an any type of way, help them feel happy, grateful, they will appreciate it alot, seeing that you stood up for them, that you helped them do something succesful. trust me they will be greatful. you are being productive. People will appreciate it alot if you help someone close to them, theyll see you are one of a kind! Just be honest with people and if they might hurt others feelings, try to say it in a nice way, dont be mean to them. And if they get it, they will like that you were being honest with them. Because you are just letting go what you think and you want to help them on whatever it was, So thats why I agree being honest is a good thing!",5,7,6,6,6,7,2821,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
359,672,7C2650EEA2B6,"Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early. First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better. Second, some students dont want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school, Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer. In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they cant think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life.

There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group. When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster. Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily. In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas. Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster. In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

If never try something new, youll never know if you life it or if youre good at it. real life experience. Helen Keller Michael Jordan After mastered basketball, he want to baseball. Cant stay at tee ball , have to practice to get to actual baseball. Emerson is therefore correct in stating "" Unless you try to do something beyond what have already mastered , you will never grow"" because to grow one must break out of comfort zone and failure leads to success. Failure lead to success, comfort zone knee jerk reaction, ""well I havent mastered anything yet so I cant adequately answer this questions"" Generic_Names example wants to mas painting. Opposition, mastering something is impossible scientific theories disproved got to school for 12 years, still have not learned everything therefore Emerson is wrong. Also, Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson states if people do not go beyond what they have already accomplished. They will never progress in life. Some peoples initial reaction would be "" I have not Masters anything, so I am unable to respond to this question."" There are a couple reasons why Emersons quote is correct. Growing requires breaking out of comfort zones and broadening horizon. If a person does not go beyond what they are capable of archiving they will not grow. Failure assists to growing and learning to lead to success. If people never expand their horizons, the they never experience new adventure life can offer. Without the thrill of a new experience, life would become aborning repetition of activities we have already mastered. Therefore, to break out of a comfort zone, people must go beyond what we have already mastered. One day at school, our band class attended a piano recital put on by Generic_School students. Even though, I was not part pf their piano class, I decided to perform unannounced. As I walked upon the stage, a my emotions flooded my body, such as nervous, anxious. However, to become a better piano performed, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and perform for entire piano and band classes. Just as Emerson said humans must go beyond a mastered trait, or comfort zone, to better themselves and not miss possible opportunities.

364,1451,35954693FE8E,"High school, the most perfect time to plan for the future. In some societies, students are required to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The high school will select courses for students to guide them toward the career they are considering. Some people say that it is not a good idea to identify career at high school because students are not ready for entering the adult world. While other people say that it is a good idea because it helps students to plan for their future. To me, I believe that knowing what am I going to do is important. Once people have their goals, they can plan and prepare for their futures. How can people plan for their futures? By thinking about the careers they want to enter, they might also think about what are the things they like to do. They could choose the careers that are the most interesting to them and the perfect colleges base upon their interests. Also, people can have more time to work on their dream such as search more information, meet basic requirements, and get advises from their counselor. Therefore, when people are ready to go to the college, they wont be confusing about what to do. Because they have their goals with them. What about prepare for the future? Well, some schools will provide courses that will fit to students the most. If the students identified their careers, they could do better at studying the related objects in college than those who havent think about that thing at all. Because the students know what they want to be, they can choose to take related courses to learn the knowledge they might use in college courses for their career. Some people can even save thousands of money just by taking AP courses which will give them the credits that college will accept. Some may argue that it is too early for students to think about their future by the time they enter high school. They have plenty of times to do that during their senior year. However, if students dont know what are they going to do after high school, they will have no idea about which college is the best for them and what career they want to have. By considering and taking the courses in high school, people could get to know the career and decide whether or not they want this career. It is better to change your mind in high school than in college. Because by that time, people will waste their money and time to change their majors. Anyway, identifying your career when you are entering high school is a really good idea. You can choose the courses that are perfect for you and your career and also be ready for college since you have your goal already. Therefore, high school is a perfect time to think about the future. It is the entry to the adult world.

365,557,2EB94A444839,"Some schools offer an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Schools think that it is a benefit that help students who dont want to go school or if they have diseases, they cant go schools. Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits. Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students cant learn good like in school. At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents dont let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they cant go to schools because they cant walk. It would be better for they because taking classes by online or they can make a video conferencing with a tutor. They can learn about all classes they want to know and it would be a benefit for their future because they will get a diploma that will be help for them. Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school. Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who dont want to go schools because if they dont like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there wont be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they cant learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who dont speak English and they dont want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I cant speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I dont want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me. For me, taking class in schools is better than home because now I go to school and it is hard even if I go to school. I am improving the language with help of teacher and friends. In conclusion, taking classes from home is not a hundred percent a benefit. It just have some benefits for some students. For some students taking classes from home is hard because they dont learn too much. Overall, if I take classes in home or school, it is something relevant because even if I am in one or anther place, I am learning something. It is not a thing of other world. It is just for students that have the purpose to learn and be someone in life. Going to school help me to improve my life each day. Each day, I can learn something new and now my language is improving because I have people who want to teach me and I am a stronger person because no one can laughing of me because I am learning.

While others think that students would not be able to learn as much as they would attending to school. For some this is a big deal while others justify this as a modern way to study. Technology could be helpful for some but not everyone in terms of studying. Most people think that schools should not adopt such way of education. People say that this is not the best way for study. The reasons people say that studying from is not a good way to study, is because students would not be inspired to do their work,not everyone has access to internet,teachers would help the students more in person That through a computer. One of the reasons people are saying that studying from home is not a good idea that students would no be inspired. Meaning that being studying from home they would not have the same environment as in school. Assisting to school would help students to focus in what they do. They would do better seeing other students working. Walking around school during free time and seeing projects made by others students could help students to be more creative. Talking to others students and sharing experiences would make students to put more effort. People say that an inspired mind creates great things. Another reason people argue is because not everyone has access to internet. Either due to economic or others type of reasons not everyone counts with access to a computer. Having some students taking classes from home while others who also want but can not because they do not have access to Internet does not seems good. Some students have to work in order to either pay their bills or buy things that they need and can not afford to have a internet source. There could be paces where getting good Internet connection could be tough because of the location or weather. This issue have people saying that access to internet is a problem when it comes to study from home. One more reason is than teachers would help the students more in person than trough the computer. Talking to though computer is not the same as talking in person .People say that students would best understand things their teachers teach them in person because they would explain with more details. Some also say that interacting with the teacher would help students confidence and learning. Some teachers have different way to teach and help the student to fully understand the topics. Students would experiment best learning by having their teacher in front of them or by their side. Meanwhile people still argue about this issue and that should be a way to solve it.

One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, lets say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects youre learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time. Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that lets say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and theres a few people in your group that arent contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone.

In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected. First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like. Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career. Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money. In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study.

373,1653,471BD41D6BA9,"Some people say that to converse resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. our school is deciding if they should do a four day school week, with nine hours consisting each day. Others rather to have a normal school week. I agree with having the normal school week because, The majorly of the high school students have part times jobs they work after school and having a nine hours school day would not leave enough time for students to work in a part time job, There are some girls at high school that have babies, and they are paying babysits, with a nine hours school days moms would spend less time with their babies and they would have to pay more hours to babysits, With an nine hours school day the amount of time to study, do homework or prepare for projects would be less then a normal school day of seven hours that can affects students grade. Other people say schools should follow this model because, A nine hour school day means more time for each class and having more time in all classes its helpful for homework or late work, They can take advantage of having Friday off students can have a job only on Fridays.

374,1929,3F2941C11D95,"By extending the school day two hours, students and teachers will have more advantages to learn and to teach. I agree to follow this model by extending the school day two hours. There are many reasons of why it will be better and will benefit us as students. One of the reasons is that we will have more time in the weekend to review our notes, homework, and things that we need help with. Another reason is that we will be doing the same forty hours of school even if we will have a four-day school week. It also will benefit teachers by increasing their time to review test or projects made by the students. Most of the time there are things at school that we do not really understand, and a four-day school week will give us more time to study and review these things at home. We the students have the opportunity to go to school and graduate, but also some of us have obligations and responsibilities. For example in my personal life, I have to work after school everyday. And most of the time when I get home, I feel tired and I just go to sleep, I forget if I have homework or not. Therefore this model will give us more time to work and being less worry about going to school five-day week. We can concentrate at school four days and the other day we can work and do homework or projects when we have to. Also a four-day school week will benefit us because we will be doing the same forty hours. Therefore our grades and education would not change. And I do not think that is necessary to study all five days, it is not about how many days do you go to school, is about how you take advantages from it. For example if you go to school everyday just to talk with your teammates, is like you were absent. For that reason I agree to extend the two hours of school, that way we can concentrate four days and having in mind that we will have three days to study or to keep learning at home. Another reason of why I agree to extend the school day, is because it will benefit the teachers also. It will benefit the teachers by giving them more time to review and grade homework, projects or test that students took in the class. It also will give us the opportunity to spend more time with our families and people around us. For example, I work with my father in construction, and I almost do not see him all day until the night. This four-day school week, will give me the opportunity to spend a entire day working with him without being worry about the school for a day. And just like me, there is a lot of people who will be benefit from it. Finally, school should be extended two hours day, that way we can have more time in the weekend to prepare for tests, teachers will have more time to grade them. And we will have three days to spend with our families. ",10,8,8,8,8,8,818,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 10"
375,949,027CB6393714,"Hello, my name is Generic_Name and I am a student at Generic_School. Students at Generic_School are required to take classes in arts. In my opinion students should not be required to take arts classes because they might need other class. First some students might want to boost there GPA so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the class room, so they might need more support in class insted of taking arts classes. students need to improve on there grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someones shift and your boss tells you to come in and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little borther or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in a extra class or in study hall. In conclusion I think that arts classes should not be a requirement for graduation because students want to get there work done, get extra help to understand their class work or they may have a job they need to get go for and need to leave early and students are not artistic.",6,6,5,7,8,6,29,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
376,512,FDC94E0FE9C8,"Have you ever did something because is on trend or just because someone else did?. As you must know humans are easily influenced by others way of thinking and acting and it is because we want other people to like us showing that humans are social individuals. The best way of influencing others is setting an example by ourselves because we tend to compare ourselves to other people, also humans repeat what they like like the fashion trends, and lastly, because social pressure can lead us to do things even if we dont want to just because everyone else did. Everyone is influenced by what others thinks or do. First, we have to begin with the way in which we usually compare ourselves to other people. Is common that if we see someone breaking the rules well claim that ""We are on our right to do it to"" . Or we can just see that this happens a lot between siblings; if one of the siblings gets something the other one will want the same. For example, when my parents buy something for my brother, I want them to buy something for me to. Or when they let my brother be out until a late hour, Ill claim that I have the right to do the same the next time I go out. People is always comparing themselves to others in what they have or dont have. Next, is imperative to analyze the humans dependence in wearing what others wear just because is in trend. If for example Gigi Hadid wears sweat pants with heals and looks good, every girl in the world would run to buy the same clothes and wear them because now is a trend; or if a girl in my school wears makeup in some way and I liked how it looked, Ill copy the look and wear it some other day. Humans like parrots repeat what they like. Finally, the social pressure can make us do things we dont want to just because someone else did. That is why many times weve heard "" If other people jumped from the bridge, Will you do it to?"". For example if we are on a party and someone offers a drink, the probability of drinking it is high because everyone else is doing it, and we want people to like us. If someone challenges us, we would do it because we want people to like us. Social pressure is an influence in what people do. In conclusion, Setting an example on our own will help us a lot in making people do what we want them to do. A smile is contagious, kindness is contagious and humans as social individuals repeat what they like and humans want people to like them.",7,6,8,7,6,7,3852,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Her smile effect me she makes want to me smile, from that moment on I know that her and I could get a long. Another example my seatmate, my first impression about him was a good one. Because he was just calm and his attitude is the same as mine. I see myself in him, him and I just get along well and his giving a good energy that I like for a person. Another example first day of our club meeting, my club teacher paired me to someone that I dont know, For us to know who are other club members are to know each other. My first impression about her was not good, because she did not talk to me when I tried to talk to her. She gives me a bad energy that I dont like to a person.

I agree, because first impression are important to me it helps me to know instantly if I like the person that I just met or not.

379,2695,0F7DB6BD1AD5,Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I think students would benefit themselfs by taking classes at home. Because they would be more focus with out anyother classmates around they would also focus more if they had a quite place to study or just do there work and students would have more time to do there work or get things done. students would focus better if they did not have a other classmate talking to them. Some students can not foucs if someone else is talking it might bother them it also might bother them if other classmates are making loud noises. For example i am one of those students that when i am taking a test i can not concentrate if other students are talking. students would have more time to study and finsh work because. They would be able to take breakes during each class. students can ask there teachers to help them study for a test or quiz they can also ask a friend to help them too. students can take a break between clases and do work for other clases. students would focus more if they had a quite place to study like the libary or somewhere they might know that would not have much noise or taking involved. students would focus better and concentrate better they will also get there work done on time. Inconclusion this is why schools should offer distance learnig for students because students would benefit themselfs to work alone with out any taking or classmates making noise. ,6,4,6,6,6,5,207,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
380,1023,408A7D3D2EEC,"Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view. Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Lets say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome. Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, thats because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life! Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Lets say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice. In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective.

381,2479,C444D6A0AC1C,"Although, many people believe that extracurricular activities can enrich students educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study and complete their homework assignments. This decision should solve with their families, because this decision shouldnt made by school, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other student or get involved with different team works, and some student dont want to do or stay after school program or any other extracurricular activities. First, whether student wants to join or do extracurricular activities they should ask parents or families first, because some parents dont wants to do the extracurricular activities. Example, some students have a lot of homework, project, tests or their different school works. Some parents dont want let the kids or students to do the extracurricular activities because of their other school works. This can cause their student fail the school or other stuff can happened to them. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by families not by schools. Then, school should help not control students to do the extracurricular for their good experiment with other students or get involved with team works. Some school wants students to do join clubs, sports, and any other after school program, because some after school program needs students to do join their program by forcefully. Example some sports coach ask to do join their team but the student dont want to join for some kind of reason, and sometime they email or call to their parents to let them join our programs. Some student dont want to join any after school program for some reason. This is why after school program or extracurricular activities should made by families decision. Lastly, some student dont want to stay after school program or any other activities. Some student are already tired from school example, some students is already taking lot of extra classes at school and they probably have lot of test and quiz or even homework. If they decided to do after school program or any other extracurricular activities then its up to their families choice, but most of students dont want to stay after school because they already have lots of homework, projects, prepare for their quiz and tests. If school wants to control student to get involve with any other after school activities then it can cause students grades, lack of sleep, and other stuff can happen to students. This is why extracurricular activities decision should made by their families or by parents. This is why I want parents or families to make a decision about after school programs. This is the three reason that I want families make a decision about after school programs not by school. Although many people believe that school should control student involvement in extracurricular activities.

382,752,12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that Ive grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field. My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion. The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship. In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me. ",10,10,10,10,9,10,259,"conventions 10, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

389,1188,C7AC45EF9D03,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, its not that easy and not everyone is able to to that. For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run. For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didnt give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Im going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did. In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. Thats honestly what I am doing right now, since Im still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

392,1884,CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school workers because they money they get payed will increase. 1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day. if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teachers use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teachers teaching everywhere they went and its very helpful, for an example they teachers was like your parents telling you to do something you dont wanna do they know is good for you but still you dont wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teachers was like back then in Generic_City, the more hours we had the more smarter we got . This evidence shows that the more time we got learning with our teachers the more smarter we got. clearly sometimes the teachers rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teachers get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject. 2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day. perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teachers because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hours was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like 1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to turn your work in its time to go innocent didnt have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done. after weeks innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teachers fault so he didnt blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all students and teachers. in addition for students to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class. clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect students grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush. In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student dont have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they cant and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didnt have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if students have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the students. if the school board add one hour and half the students grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

395,2296,5384378F1AC2,"The great question here is, should schools allow students to use cell phones for educational purposes or should cell phones be prohibited in the classroom? In my opinion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Some school staff members may claim that cell phones should be forbidden in the classroom even for eductional purposes. Because, they think students will lose their attentions. However, I firmly believe that shools should allow students to use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students will be effective academically as long as they use cell phones in the classroom. There are several reasons for my opinion. My first reason is that as a student, whenever I use cell phones in the classroom, I can search things easily and take pictures when nedded if my teachers allow me; which will help me on my studying when I go home. Another reason for my opinion is, if I dont have my phone with me, I will be eager until the bell rings and get my phone back without concentrating on the class. For example, I have a friend whose father took her cell phone forcing here to study the whole school year. Stubbornly, she stops doing what he tells her to do. Instead, she persistently hang-out and have more fun. As a result, she got Fs for all of her classes. Therefore, using cell phones in the classroom helps the learning-teaching process. Using cell phones in the classroom helps to call if something happens in the class. For instance, if a stranger comes with a gun or if a lock-down happens and I hear the strangers voice, I will call 911 for help. Secondly, if an emergency occurs like fire, hurricane, and a huge lightneing while I am in the class, I may need to call to my family to let them know how I am doing. In that case, they will know about my situation. To sum up, most people like doing things which are forbidden for them. Students may hide and use their phones for another purpose eventhough they are not allowed to use it in the classroom; which is more riskier than using in front of the teachers. Consequently, the positive effect of using cell phones in the classroom is more influential. In conclusion, schools should use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Other people say that cell phones should not be used in schools during class periods. I obstinately argue that phones should be used in the classroom for the purpose of education since the positive effect is more influential and using cell phones is more quicker than using laptops or other electronic devices.",8,8,8,8,8,7,1093,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
396,562,AB6284069E18,"Some schools offer education at home, online, and or video conference calls. Teachers and some students believe that off campus is horrible. The reason why is : you wont have an actual human teaching you with online classes ,Video conference calls arent great because most people arent paying any attention to the teachers or student also you would need more assistance which is just unnecessary. Then finally you wont meet any people and you wont learn how to socialize at the end you wont learn how speak to people. The school that offers these programs should just destroy these programs. Students should learn to how to go to school. Learn how to make friends,teachers,also day to day people. Just go get an education which is very important thing to do and that needs to happen if you want to do anything for the future the place they should just get an education is on a on campus school. To the schools that offer the out of school education some that are at home,online,and video calls. Teachers and a lot of surveys show that having students with out of school education tend to have lower grades, more missing assignments,and less people in there lives. The facts just show that if you arent at a on campus school,Youre grades tend to be way lower then the average student on campus student. If you dont go to on campus schooling you will become social awkward. Its not fun staying home With the online classes these days it has some benefits but the end of the day its still a very bad distraction usual for example people love to watch television while doing work , but they arent doing the assignment with 100 percent attention. If you want to get something done do it the right way. Also with the student they have many ways to cheat with any kind of education thats not on a on campus school cheating is 100 percent wrong not the right thing to do. Studies show that if you have two or more things that you are doing you are doing at the same time they arent using there whole brain to do theyre work. One of the major reason why online classes arent good because you can just google the answers thats just cheating you arent learning its cheating. Video Conference calls are just a waste of time. Students dont listen or even look at the screen to the call. Its just better and useful if you went to school. Just go to school you wont have to do calls and extra things like calling over and over again. Also it teaches you not to be lazy. If you go to school you wouldnt need to call or anything of the sort just go to school and get an education. The school should destroy these programs and students need to go to an on campus school education or they wont be able to anything for the future for there education because they didnt pay attention or learn it well plus they wont have any friends to know them. In conclusion students should be able to go to an on campus school just like the rest of us and meet new people and friends for the future.

Also we all can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And we dont feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing alone. Friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. And we all put our interest to do the best as we can with the work. And we try that the work look good and nice. Also we put our effort to do the work and that the teacher see that we all work together. And we try our best to do the work the way that she or he wanted to be. And friends or partners can be good if we need to do a drawing or with the hand writing. Also if youre partners help you with the work the teacher is going to sacrifice with the work that all of you are doing. We all do the work more faster than doing the work alone. Because we try that everyone have one part of the work. And that way we can finish the work fast. Also everyone participate in the work. And we all have some part of the credit. Also we try to do the work fast but also we try that the work look good. And we no just do the work fast because we want to finish quick and them do nothing. Sometime it because the teacher a specific time to finish and with a group we can finish on time and also the work can look good too. We dont feel the job or work hard as we usually felt doing the work alone. We dont feel the work hard because we separate the work in parts. And if there is 4 in a group we all 4 do a list one part of the work. Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work. In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation. Because you have to intelligent and organize first and everyone know what they have to do we all can get a good grade in the work. Some of the benefits that we can get working in groups are. Work with friends or partners can help us to do the work better and more simple. Also we can do the work more faster than doing the work alone. And final we dont feel the job or work hard s we usually felt doing alone. Also working in groups it help to the development. For me it better working in a group have many beneficial and is very helpful to do the work good and nice foe the teacher can be proud of the group work.

Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when theyre in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me ""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them. So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when shes sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and sees her like that they say that shes wired from how she acts, but her first imression wast like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and were a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that shes very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how shes diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see peoples impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some ones mind when they see some one impressions for the first time. I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow peoples impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation. Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someones story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Peoples reactions might chang after an accident happen to some ones in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some ones reactions if we see them the next time or day.

402,2040,AF98232BDB08,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldnt use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldnt be doing and that wont help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldnt use their cell phones in class is that they arent learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and wont be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they dont do well on because they havent been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they cant do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students dont need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they dont need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they wont need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they wont be doing their work they will be doing other things that arent importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldnt be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldnt be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.",5,5,6,5,5,5,2364,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

If i am about to do something that i can get in a big trouble for should ask my parents or other adults for an advice. I would ask different people for an advice, because i can understand something i could do better. Another good thing about asking for an advice is that if i go to like prison for murder, drugs or alcohol, in the future when i go look for a job nobody will want to hire me because of the stuff i did. If i am going to do something really bad in school i should think about consequences that will be and ask someone or more people if it is going to be worth of doing. When i am having trouble doing something or understanding something i should ask others a advice of whats a good way or doing it. I think that other people should really ask for a advice. If someone wants to do something bad that they can get in trouble or they can ask for an advice.

405,670,ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. Its like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family. First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important. Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). Ive seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing. Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However youre just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world youll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad. In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has its flaws it also has its pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything. This is everything on why I think we accomplish more by being active. ",9,8,8,8,9,7,2322,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

I agree with Waldo Emersons quote because if theres someone thats trying to make you something that your not, being yourself will be a very duanting task. When I was in the 8th grade someone who I thought was one of my friends wanted me to change who I was because they though that I wasnt cool enough to hangout with anymore, at first i thought that I was the problem, but I learned that true friends wont try to change who you are, no mather what. Being yourself is one of the hardest things you can try to do, possible because your to shy, you dont think your good enough, your scared of what others will think of you. I always hated thinking about myself because i never though that I was good enough for anyone or good enough to do anything, so I kept everything bottled up inside, at one point or another I even thought about killing myself but was to scared to do antthing to try anything. So I decided acted like everything was ok untill I tricked my self into belaveing that I was happy, but that didnt last. Now im in the 11th grade I came across a certen individuality(my current girlfriend) who, when I around, cant stop feeling real happyness. Everyday I think about how lucky I am to have met her.

There is a lot of benefits of having a positive attitude which are health or physical improvements, how to solve a problem, and the power that exists inside you. The benefits of optimism extend beyond stress relief better health, more rewarding relationships and enhanced productivity. People with a positive outlook tend to experience are reduced incidence of depression, lower stress levels and are better able to cope with stress causing events, an incresed life span and overall better health. People with a positive outlook on life are also more likely to live healthier lifestyle, and to smoke cigarattes less and drink less alcohol. Attitude is the way taht we behave and we react to the daily activities, consequently a positive attitude may influence our life and it aspects in a deep way such as how we think, socialize, and even how our health is. All these aspects might be affected by a positive attitude. Actually it is proved that successful people have been influenced by the way they see the circumtances in their life. In other words, successful people see those circumtances with a positive attitude and they see those circumtances as a challange to beat and not like a punishment to suffer. Therefore, these people will be more likely to fight and have success in their life, rather than the ones who see their life as a punishment. Positive attitude might be the key to all the people who want to fulfill their dreams. If everyone would apply these concepts in their lives, they would become happier because they will see that everything including their life, situations, and problems, is under their own control. Even though there are some people who wonder how to get a good positive attitude, is not simple to get it. Almost every single person that has has a positive attitude is because tehy have had a motivation or a feeling that supports their fight to reach their goal or achievement. When you have a positive attitude, you feel that there is a power inside of you that motivates you to do something or to get involved with something. These people are most commons to have best attitudes of this world. Having a positive attitude can lead you to the lighter, braver and stronger way to stand against negative attitude.

408,3100,791AF7B78178,"My position about this prompt is that students should not take the program that allow students to graduate them in three years, because is not like taking normal classes, for example what would happen if students get to take the program that will allow them to graduate in 3 years? They would have to take more classes in less time: Because as I read in the prompt there was one part that says ""for students in order to graduate must take summer courses"", and this means that they would not have a break in this time. Not because of the time but for those students that would decide that they would not only risk to fell some classes but also not to take elective classes during summer because thats what this prompt says. It will be more stressful: As we all know school sometimes can be stressful but imagine how stressful if for students that graduate in four years as every other normal programs that high schools offer, now imagine how it would it be for students that take programs allowing them to graduate in three years. Ill say they have to work even harder, during the summer they have to take courses in order to be upgraded to the grade the are going to, also a lot of SOLs test will be taking in less time, Im not saying that those people wont have enough time to study, but what Im saying is they would have a really busy schedule with all their classes plus all of those tests coming up it wont be easy for them. The reason that why I used those examples to explain the main idea like this, it was for you to understand that such as that program it can be very difficult for students, not just that but for students that might not be quick to understand new subjects or new units, it can get them stuck in there with no option but to get into a point when they would just give it up and quit because it will get really hard for them. Now that I showed you how hard could it be for students that would take a three year high school program, now it clarifies that theres no need to rush with education and that students should take normal high school program because it wouldnt be so hard as taking the other program that I just talk about, in conclusion students have more changes to graduate with a four-year-program, as long as they keep themselves in track with what they are suppose to do it wont be no problem, and there will be less stress for them, more freedom to take a break when they need to, and enough time to study.",6,7,6,7,6,7,1588,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on peoples lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person. In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people dont talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you dont have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person. Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you dont have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it. Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesnt have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games. To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives.

411,2672,F75D6E5CCE78,"Imagine how life would feel like when you cant have your favorite food at your favorite spot in school? would it even be fun to go to school or not. About a week or two ago i went to Panda Express to grab some food on my way home but at the time that I got there, I asked to get some white rice with some orange chicken but the workers told me they have changed their menu a little bit so i cant have some,at that point i fell so sad because that was the only spot that sold some in town. I think the change of the school menu would be a bad idea because,it will make students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way,it would also bring some money problems in school and it would also make some students keep on empty stomach during the school day till they get home to prepare some food. secondly,If students leave the school ground to go get some food in a illegal way andthey never came back, this would leave the parents worried because since the principal decided to change the menu they would have a reason for leaving school ground. Mr. principal i would be happy to tell you to leave the menu like how it is because it would make some students get in trouble and a lot of incidents will happen when they leave.0nce a bad incident happen out of the school ground,the principal would be responsible for all the damages caused when they left, keeping the old menu would be a good idea but we dont want our accidents and school detentions to increase. In addition to this it would cause some money problems because if students are going to have to eat healthy then how would they gain more money easily to support the school when they are in needs of something. This is some of the way you can make more money so, Mr principal if you decide to change it the school is going to have to shut down at a point because when is no money to operate the school and pay the teachers and custodians they would have to leave their job and get a better one and once everyone one is gone there would be any teachers to teach the students. Mr principal because of this reason we should keep the old menu so that students and teachers can enjoy their selves in the school. Therefore if the principal end up using the healthy menu this will led to some students getting sick because they will have to leave their stomach empty and they cant have what they want. This will cause a protest in the county because they supposed to eat what they like, and what the cafeteria think will be good for them to eat. In case of this of this reason the teachers will teach for no reason because the student are so focused on going home to eat what their mom or dad have prepared waiting for them,so if the principal wants them to focus in class then he is supposed to give them what they like. In conclusion i think leaving the old menu would be a good idea because if the principal wants the students to try to improve in their class then he should leave it. Therefore if the students wants to add th healthy menu on it then he should let them vote on it whether they agree on what he is saying but i would say leaving the old one should be the best for the students.

Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free. Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day.

Two-thirds of the students who join an after school activity club are more likely to succeed in academics then students who do not. Schools should establish an after school homework club because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and give students some teaching experience. Firstly, an after school homework club helps students finish their homework in time. Many student get a low grade in their class because of unfinished homework. They were not able to finish their homework because, they did not know how to do it. Teachers do not usually have the time to go through each student, and help them in class, but some teachers volunteer to meet with students who have difficulty in certain subjects in an after school homework club. Joining an after school homework club is a great way to finish your homework in time. Sometimes teacher might even give students some tips and tricks on how to solve a question, that they would not give out in class. My friend Generic_Name used to have a lot of difficulties with his math homework until he joined the after school homework club in our school. He learned many tricks on how to solve a math equation and even taught a trick to solve an ""Integer Slope Inequality"" equation. Moving on, an after school homework club can help students become more socially interactive. While in an after school homework club, you can find students with the same difficulties as you. This will give students something to relate to and not feel out of place. Having group discussions on how to solve a problem and having group projects in your club will also help you be more socially interactive. My friend Generic_Name made many friends by joining the after school homework club in our school, and grew a lot of confidence. He is now much less nervous when talking to people than before. Lastly, homework clubs can give students teaching experience for if they want to be a teacher when they grow up. Students can volunteer to help other students finish their homework in an after school homework club. This will give the student a lot of experience on how to teach, and deal with other students. There is a team of students is our school called the "" Junior Honor Society"", which helps students with academic difficulties every day after school. As a member, I have learned about a lot of ways to teach someone else, and because of my desire to be a teacher one day, this helps me a lot. Schools should establish homework clubs because it can help students finish their homework, become more socially interactive , and can give students teaching experience.

415,501,0F3EC382C3CB,"The benefits of working in as a group or working alone. I believe working as a group is more beneficial for the students. My friend Generic_Name is very capable of doing school work by himself. However, even he needed others help to understand somethings. I am very capable of doing a school project by myself. However, even I could use some one elses input in the matter. I believe working together as a group is beneficial . For example, my friend Generic_Name he is a very smart person. He was on the top of the class with grades but, even he could not do it by himself. One day the teacher assigned us projects. Generic_Name decided to do it alone. On the due date, which was later that week Generic_Name turned in the project. The teacher told him he failed he did not understand why. The teacher later on the day took him aside and explained that he was not understanding the question. He asked her how he could make up the points for the failed project. Two weeks after that she assigned another project. She took Generic_Name aside and said this time work with somebody"". Generic_Name listed so he asked somebody to work with him. The day the project was due, he was nervous because he does not work with people often. The teacher told him they got a perfect score. The teacher took him aside and told him why he passed. She told him he passed because when you have more than just one persons input. Things become clear so when you do not understand something that other persons input can help. Another reason I believe working as a group helps is when I was in high school we were assigned a two part project. The first part I had to do by self. I got it done when the due date came the teacher told us to pick a partner. I picked a friend of mine, Generic_Name. The teacher told us to compare our papers. However, our paper even though they were on the same subject, they were very different. She later told us to now write a paper on the same subject but working together. When we were all done with the two parts she told everyone to rotate their papers to the right once. Everyone passed them on the teacher then told the whole class to read all three papers and to pick which one made more sense. When every one was done they all picked the one that made the most sense and gave it to her. Every single one of those papers she got were all the one people worked on together. She then asked the class why they did not pick the other one. They all said because the other papers were one sided as in only one perspective. Some students may say working alone is better. However, Generic_Name and I both learned that in some places you need two sides to a story, argument and debate. If I would have gone on with my life thinking the way I thought before I worked with some one, it would be very different in some perspective. My friend Generic_Names life would have been very different too.

I recommend you talk to your teacher about this and get more group projects going. Talk to your parents about how you could use those skills in the outside world, become surprised by how much you use them, and by how easier your life become.

The school has multiple enjoyable sports like baseball, basket ball, and soccer, but the most fun for me would be foot ball because it has a lot of physical movement. Way I like it so much is because the strategy you and your teammate use and because u can put more trust in other people and its fun to play against other team and learn how they work. Or if sports is not something you like that much the science club dose different experiment like when they made a volcano they made erupt it was fun helping them. The drama club is something that most people like because of all the acting and getting to know more people its amazing wen people that nobody notice before can be come stars bay working hard and practicing all their lines and not mess up its amazing. Or may be more of a musical person theirs a classroom for people that can play an instrument they make loud but enjoy able music to dance to they are kinda amazing and then wen people start singing its amazing wen your body hears their voices its incredible I wont lay right now out of everything the music classroom is what i like the most over sports and everything else.",6,5,8,7,7,5,2697,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
417,902,03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so. Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you. Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when youre a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way. In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents. So yes, I think people should make there own decisions.",7,7,8,7,8,8,44,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

419,2497,52FEF34F4AC7,"Should students take online classes? Students can learn more by taking online classes? students have benefits for attend classes from home?. On this paper I will argue about how students have benefits attend classes from home, and how improves skills for he future. I think that students would have benefits for attend classes from home, because is a new opportunity for study more, and for improve more the skills more online classes for the future. Teenagers that are attend classes from home I think will be more healthy, because that means that students will be more able to sleep , and will be have more time to rest the brain, and more time to do all the things at home, because a lot of students they do not sleep during the night the reason, because they work others that always talks with a friends and others that they use technology, and waking up at the early morning make the students brain tired, and makes the students do nothing at school for the rest of the day. Students will be more organizing there time meaning that students will be able to have more time to have job, or do others activities during the day, or after taking classes online, because when they attend to school they do not manege very good the time they always doesnt care about time or do something important. Students will be putting more attention to classes, because when teenagers attend to school most of the things that distract the students are the friends and the technology means that teenagers when are around friends distract the mind out of the class, and that causes that students dont pass the class, or the test, otherwise when are taking classes from home there is no body around that can distract and loss the attention of the students and will be more easy to do homework, projects, and study for test. Some people say that the idea of students attend classes online from home will have more benefits is a bad idea, because they say,""Teenagers are lazy, and they will sleep more late at night"". Students taken classes online will be more smart, because there will more practice skills for the future where will be benefits of know how classes are doing online, and they where taking. On the future students will be able to attend classes from home, and will have benefits for skills, and this will make the teachers more easy to turn any work or practice any class that they missed, and that way students can have more ideas how will things will change and compare between attend to school and take classed online.",6,6,6,6,5,6,1086,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
420,3084,75DAA54880C1,"The author Ralph Emerson wrote, To be yourself in a world that is constlantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I totally agree with Emersons statement because be something else is not the most greatest accomplishment that you can do, the most important accomplishment that you can do in this big worl is always be yourself, be humble about everything, be kind with others, and never change the person that you really are. First, bring humble is one of the most important thing that we always need to have no matter what. Being humble can take you to the top, to be successful in the life. For example, Marisela de Montecristo, is a salvadorian beauty queen, who wob the title of Miss Universe last year and Nuestra Belleza Latina in 2013. Marisela grow up very poor, but when she was 10 years old, she emigrated with her mom to this country looking for a better life, however, when she came here she went to the school, she learned English, and she did graduated in social communication. In 2013 she decided to compete in a reality show that is called Nuestra Belleza Latina and she won, and with all the money that she won, she decided to founded an own restaurant for her mom in Las Vegas, Nevada. Six years latter, she decided to compite for Miss Universe El Salvador 2018, where she resulted the winner. That year she went to Thailand to compite for the title of Miss Universe. Now she is a famous person and she have her own foundation that helps people in countries around the world like Africa, El Salvador, Mexico, Philipines. Also she is modeling in differents countries like Paris, Spain, and Great Britain, but above all this things that shes is doing, she always still humble. In one interview with Telemundo, she said that being humble is the key of being successful in the live, and I totally agree with her. Second, be kind with others is something that defined you as a good person, because people love when someone is really interesting in help others. For example, I think that we should be kind with others, help others, because we never know when we going to need help of these people, in addition, being kind is other accomplishment that you can do in this life, and is something that you can feel proud of be. Third, never change who you really are for something passenger or for something that can not give you happiness, because be yourself is the most important thing that you can do in this big world. For example, my mom told me that being myself is the only thing that can make the difference of me between everyone, she also told me that being gay is not a hindrance to triumphing in my life, because with effort, dedication, and persistence I can do many things in my life, without necessity of change the person who I am. To finish, be yourself is the only and the best thing you can do in your life. There is not other way to be happy and to demostrated to the world that you dont have to be something else to be successful and to make greatest accomplishment in your life, because the key always is going to be be yourself and be proud the person who you are.",7,7,6,5,5,6,1534,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Some kids go outside in front of their house and play other games like hopscotch, jump rope, or like other people they can do other activities outside and ride bikes around or go to a skate park. there are endless amounts of activities for people to do outside, playing on the swings at the park can be fun because when i go there i like to see who can go the highest and sometimes i just do it for fun when im bored People that like to find and inspect bugs can go at the park, the park has lots of bugs including butterflies, ladybugs, caterpillar, and fireflies. some people find bugs interesting for some reason. theres also a park called a dog park. but you would normally see kids having fun, Other people at the park like to play tag, tag is a very fun game and i think that kids would have fun playing it, hide and seek is also an option. theres no point of going to the park if you cant have any fun.

423,240,A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity. Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide. Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life. My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college. go to school guys and stay in school.",7,6,8,8,6,6,2144,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

425,1777,7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day. Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with peoples attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults dont take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isnt easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through whats stop you from being happy. Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday. Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again. In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

I would hire the best people for the job so they can help their patients, some nurses or doctors are not too good at their job. I would let any patient in no matter where theyre from, because some hospitals judged the way people look, their race or the color of their skin. Finally I would help the homeless. Not all the money that I would have would be for me, because some I would give it to the homeless. I would buy them food and clothes, because some homeless people have clothes and some dont, and some are just waiting to be feed.

428,226,51C93A7260DE,"Have you ever thought what school would be like for you and other, students in your school would have a program where older and younger kids will gather around, do different activities and projects and learn at the same time. Think about programs you will want to be included in your school,that will help you learn faster and make you understand things better and differently,you will also get help and subjects you have struggles on a daily bases. In my opinion i feel like students feel more better and cofterble talking to students there age just because it might be easy for them to explain things better to someone who is the same age. Theres times where students feel more pressured by an adult so thats what makes them not want to ask for help. Now think to yourself and ask yourself if you find it better, having a program where all students can gather around just to ask for help when is needed and so socializes with them. Because theirs always time you get to school and talk to your everyday friends but you dont really know theres other people you havent met yet so making a program for everyone is a good way to get to know others in the program. So with all that being said if you want to have a program at your school, that will help you and other students gather around and bond together like friends and get to know everyone in your school. Is not just in the program that will be in your school but people that you walk by every other day gather around and teach everyone something new and they can give back to you and teach you something new everyday to anyone in the program.

429,1195,CC24D88BEB8E,"I agree with Churchills idea that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm; Although, many people believe that failure will take you down and make you doubt about your potential; however, failure also help you to progress, gives you different ways to achive your goals, and makes you become even stronger than what you were before failing. Failure is always there, a lot of times we thing failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you efor even much harder situations, if you dont fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress. Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it give you choices and failure let you know the things you couldve done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didnt know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but i didnt give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kicked it with more precission. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way. Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail and you are beaten down and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesnt give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it. Edison was asked ""How does it fell to fail 100 times?"", and he answered, ""I didnt failed, the light bulb was a proyect that took 100 steps to be done"". In conclusion, failure and mistakes help you learn from them, failure gives you other ways to accomplish your goals and it makes you stronger than what you were before, I think people shouldnt be afraid of failure, they have to start failing, because when they get to reach their goals, their satisfaction when they achive it, its going to be even bigger.",7,6,6,6,6,6,2794,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

431,2915,BF267B42A2A4,"The humanity now in days had been not so good lately, there is many different opinions on how you should do things in life or how you should act. It is well informed that people can be complicated but nobody will said the life will be easy all the time. I think people should start making their own decision because, they can learn about life, have a better understanding on how life works and how to value their-self and be efficient person on their own. However, there is a big chance that people can tell you how you really should live your life, you have to experienced it in persons there will be a day when you are going to fall or something can happen you are not aware on how life can be so hard and difficult in times. Also mistakes are allow nobody is perfect life will surprise you anytime without you notice it you got to be ready to face it not matter how easy or hard it could be. When you make your owns decision you will be capable of making the right decision for yourself. Meanwhile, it is hard to understand life sometimes but is part of our daily life and you have to understand how it really works so the way you do not stress out for a simple thing, life gives you challenges that only you as the only responsible of yourself have to face it and all will depends how you take things it will be a result of it. As we grow life will make us stronger or weak it all depends but best choice of making the right thing is that you should be aware that anything can happen without given you a hint it will hit you on the right time or not on the best time you wanted it. Anything that will hurt you will make you strong and thats how you know that your are living life. Lastly, people might not notice it but if we do not love ourselves nobody will do it, people do have to depend on some else to be happy its all about you. In addition anything you do will not make others happy you have to learn to do everything on your own because that more efficient you are the more good things in life you will make. Be your own and value every single thing that is around, but remember nothing is easy life can surprise you anytime. In conclusion, people should start making their own decisions to be aware of what life really is if your learned and have a better understanding about life in a daily routine anything that will happen will not surprise you. Loving yourself will make you love others. Hopefully people will take a note that life is all about you and not others each person has a different thoughts and ways of seen life.

First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them. Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think its impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it.

435,1756,F1596AB60E72,"Do you think it is more beneficial to work in groups? Do you think working in groups makes you focus? Do you think working in groups is easy and fun?. Do you think working in groups is more easier?. May people will say No and others will say yes to all these four question. working in groups is more beneficial than working alone. I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time. Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on. Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo, assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time. Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay, but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus , it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group. In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful. ",6,7,8,7,6,6,3559,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Asking advice from two people is a hard digestion to make, but he will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better choice because he will know which advice to choose. Also he will have better opinions of advice, then bad ones. If he chooses older person and not younger person, its because older people have more experience. First, reason is he will know which advice to choose. He will go with his gut feeling and make the right choice. For example, if he asks advice from his best friend and his friend he would go with his best friends advice because that is his gut feeling. He also knows if its smart, or not. He knows he has to listen to his heart not his head. Second, reason is he will have better opinions of advice, than bad ones.

437,5,85E3C840FCBF,"I agree with the idea of a year-round school because It sounds great to me. This idea has a lot of benefits towards the students and also the educators too. This idea provides a beneficial environment for both the students and the educators. One of the reasons that this is a great idea is that,It makes the students to retain information easily when they get back from their break. They would retain information easily because the break they were given wasnt a long break and that will help them remember the materials that they were taught before the break. The other reason is that,the students will gain more knowledge by learning more materials. They will learn a lot of which will be beneficial to them,not only inside the school but also outside the school. They will also stay on task and be more focused on their studies. Another reason is that,this idea of a year-round school will make work easy for the educators. It will make their work easy by not making them repeat the materials that the previously have taught because the students are able to remember the materials easily. They wont be forced to create retake tests and assignments and that would allow them to have an easy job. An example of why a year-round school is beneficial is that,It creates an environment where the students enjoy learning and the educators enjoy teaching. Lastly,I would say that a year-round school is a great idea because It creates an environment where both the students and the educators can benefit from. It Impacts both the students and the educators in a productive way. The students would have more passion and love towards learning while the educators would also gain more passion towards their profession and remarkably enjoy teaching.",5,6,6,5,7,6,1769,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
438,682,A5E657C1B23A,"Many schools have partnerships with companies that allows students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. To get the job you like makes it more interesting .I would like to be selected to get the job that I am interested in because I want to get the experience and improve my skills to become an experts of it. Dear Mr. Manager, I heard that you are selecting students to give them the opportunity to work in your company to gain experience, and to see if that job interests them. I want to be one of them, and to see if I am able to do the job the way it should be done. This opportunity can give me the chance to get more experience and to see if the job is interesting for me. I can make sure that if I get the job I will learn more about it. For example, Generic_Name, a smart student in my biology class was always wanted to work in a science department and to be a biology teacher in future. Last year she got the chance to work with Generic_City Biology and Science department. After a while she gives up and didnt continue to her job anymore. The reason that she left the job was that she didnt find it easy and interesting. This chance helped her a lot to select a better option and choose something new. She is happy about it, because she got experience and that was a golden chance for her to see if she is good at science subjects and that changed her mind not to become a biology teacher. Furthermore, I can add that getting the job that you like gives you more positive energy towards it and makes you work hard for it to achieve your goal. We cant improve our skills until we dont try something new. Improvements always comes from doing something if we set goals to improve our skills definitely we will achieve it. Every job and activity we do we must have some good skills in it, or if we dont we can work on it to improve it. For example, my brother loved to work with IT companies, he is good in repairing laptops and mobiles. He was studying Cisco and switch repairing at Sterling IT institute. He was doing good in his class, but for improving his skills and to see if he had learned something he needed to get a job. He started making labs at home with his classmates and was looking for a job. After he was approved by one of Cisco companies, he started improving his career and working hard to learn more everyday. After a year, beside that he is studying,he is now serving as a substitute in his institute. Its all because he has more experience and worked on his skills. Furthermore, I can say that having skill and talent can give us more motivation and helps us improve more everyday. In conclusion, I can say that getting involve in such programs and company jobs helps students to choose their career and gives them the opportunity to see if they really want that job or are they ready for the career that they are dreaming for.

439,1363,FC2050EA9039,"The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you dont believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It cant hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesnt make sense to try and understand a concept that wont make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I cant grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why its not possible to master difficult problems. Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because its not so much a person cant grow but dont have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.

In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery.

Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you cant do one small task doesnt mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow.

Jonh Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. everyone have the completly control over themselves, no matter how bad the circumtances may be or how tough a problem is, everyone will always be allow to choose either to smile or cry, to be positivee or negative for example; My grandma, shes a 78 years old lady that have work her entire life, shes a very independent women who always says, ""If i dont do it, no one can make it as good as i can."" Always with a positive attitude, never sitting down, because she says that sitting down is a waste of time, and she have always been so energetic, until one day that sadly she had a really strong stroke in the middle of her brain that made her lose movement on half of her body, and her voice, her doctor told us that she was going to stay in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, it was hard to see someone so positive and with so much energy, in a wheel chair for the rest of her life, everyone was really shock and depressed about it including my mom, but even though my grandma knew what was going on her positive attitude never change, she took over the circumstances and she never gave up on herself she decided to be ""positive"", even though it was a rough time in life, this example helped me to see that everyone have their own control or they can choose who they want to be in the hard or easy times. Everyone can have the freedom to choose the enviroment around them, how they wanna live, with who they wanna leave, people have the abilitly to understand when there are toxic people around them, to understand how much an enviroment can change the way they act, to understand that they can change the negative enviroment into a positive enviroment, everything in your character depends on your onw person, yes the enviroment that is around you can affect a lot on your character, affects on what you do in a daily base, but at the end of the day it alwasy depends on you, who you wanna be, who the people around you should make you feel, and how positive or negative it should be. Having a reaction with other people around you can show them what your character is, it can show people your weakest part, and can shows them how dangerous or calm you can be, reactions are a really big part of our characters either if we have the control of them or not, how we react and how we respond depends on us, for a lot of people having their own character its really hard, because of their negative or positive mood, sometimes we want to be or act like other people that we see at school, but thats like stealing their characters, at least but not last everyone have the freedom to choose what their character traits are or can be. In conclusion everyone is free to choose what they character should be, no matter if they are going through a rough time or have the whole word agains them, theywill always have the chance of trying to be someone else character or build their own, but it will alwaysbe what they choose their character traits to be.

447,944,DD474E5804C0,"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home? In this prompt I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time. Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that theyll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination. Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesnt like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well. In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Students would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job. Some people say that school is very important for students, that theyll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they wont drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month. All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that students can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.

448,343,40E6BC53EC01,"Just imagine you have an important basketball game at your school. Since you have three hours to get to the school, you decided to go watch a movie with some friends. When the movie finished you realize is already late, and that you need to go home to get the basketball uniform and your water. Ten blocks away your house you realize that the traffic is getting for ever, you feel like is never going to end, that the minutes passed so slowly, really nervous, and sweaty. When you get home and check the clock you see you have just twenty minutes to get ready and go to school, your mom is screaming at you really angry because she is always telling me to be responsible. You arrived your team is already playing without you. Since you get there late Generic_Name tells, ""You are not going to play today, because you are not responsible."" I think a good lesson I can teach to the kids is responsibility at home, school projects, and sports. First, responsibility at home is really important because is were we live, and when you are responsible you show respect to your parents. One day my best friend Generic_Name called me because she wanted to get a coffee and tell me she was really nervous of failing the year because she have not been responsible. I told her, ""I am going to ask my mom."" When i asked my mom she told me really angry, ""Have you fix your room and wash the dishes?"" I respond, ""I have fixed my room, but I have not washed the dishes."" I supposed that she was angry so that was an no. I tell Generic_Name I cannot go, and she was really sad about it. Later I realized that I was not responsible about doing my duties at home. That is why you need to be responsible of doing your duties at home. Next, you need to be responsible with school projects because in this way you get better grades. When I was in elementary school I remember I need to do a science project for the science fair. I wanted to get the first place of all the school cause I knew that i will feel really happy of it. I decided to do a wave experiment, but it was really complex and i knew it would take a long time to do it. I collect all the materials and build it, but i did not remember about the poster. The poster need to be really big and with the hypothesis, procedure, materials, results, and pictures. I did not make my best work in that poster, so I get i ninety percent and third place. I feel really good about the results, but I learn that in order to be better we need to be responsible at school. Finally, responsibility at sports. I did not know we needed to be responsible when practicing any sport. Just imagine you have the last soccer game of the year. Generic_Name have told you many times the directions of what you need to do all the week before the game, but you have not follow them correctly. One of the directions was eat healthy, but you have been eating pizza all the week. Other direction was drink a lot of water every day, but instead of drinking water you drink soda. The day of the game has came, and you did not get prepared because you did not wanted to be responsible. When you are at the middle of the game you start to feel really dizzy. Generic_Name and the nurse take you out, and tell you why are you so ill. In sports you need to be responsible of your health. Responsibility is what make us be better. In think responsibility help us have a better place to live. I list three ways we can show we are responsible. To show the importance of it. Ways we can show we are responsible are making duties at home, at school, and practicing any sport.",6,6,6,6,6,6,847,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

452,1317,C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are. Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldnt get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude. Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didnt like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didnt want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didnt take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldnt because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you dont know them. First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are. Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change. Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think its a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change. In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",9,8,9,8,7,7,2678,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

These are the reason why I would love to go to Korea beacuse of there food, the beautiful places, and the time I can get to myself. One reason, why I love Korea as much is beacuse of the food. The food in Korea is so tasty for example the korean BBQ (Barbeque). Korean BBQS is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse its spicy and I love spicy foods. But the best part adout the food in Korea is the street food beacuse its so cheap but yet so tasty that I could die for it. Another reason, is the beautiful places in Korea.

The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan. Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. Every single thing in the hotel in is clean beacuse korean people dont like to be messy they love to be organized. The relaxition spas are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress. These are the main things I suggest you to do if you want to realease the stress and have some ""me time"". In conlusion, I suggest you to take a trip to korea. One, is beacuse the food is great, especially the street food. Second, it have the most amazing places to visit like Han River. Last but not least, is the relaxation time i can get for myself.

Students who also have a bad attitude should not get to play either. If students really want to play sports or join activities they would really try hard not to be bad. If students have a 69 or below they should not let them play sports until they have a passing grade. If many of the students have a C average they should try harder on their work for those who love sports and who like to join activities. I bet students who have a C average are mad because they cant play sports until they get a C average. I would like to convince the principal that they should at least get a B average.

458,2949,C495D1E686C0,"From my point of view, this is a good idea because most students have a different situation in their life. Sometimes, they woud like to become an independent person, so nobody can coerce to do something even their parent. In my eyes, it is not important that the students finish high school in three year or four year. After graduating from high school, they are a good person, arent they?. I think this is a most important problem. To me, the students should be a good citizen because the society needs them to develop. A good behavior is more necessary than graduation, and they have to practise or use the lesson that were learned in high school, so they will get a lot of experience. The life is an adventure, discovery, and study. Day by day, everything is changing rapidly. Due to this problem, the student not only study in textbook, or document but also learn from substantial. When we face up with difficult problem, it gives us more valuable experience in the life, i think this experience is too hard to find in book, or school. If you graduate in high school early it will give you more time to learn new things from your life, so you will grow up and have a lot of opportunities to success in life. For instance, Generic_Name who i admired, was a founder the Coffee Shop Company in my country. He was still graduate high school early and then i worked for his company. At that time, he was learning how to grow a special coffee, which is the only one not only in vietnam but also over the world. At the present, his company is the best coffee company in Vietnam. He said to me that difficulty, experience are the keys to success. Actually, the life is a challenge: it isnt easy to you. If you would like subdue it you have to prepare everything as soon as you graduate high school. Therefore, the student finish high school early; it is very neccessary to prepare for new challenges in the life. As we can see, the economy is delicated and various, so you have more time to find an occupation which is suitable for you. I believe that 50% senior were confusing about their future because most of their time is in school, class, which forgot going ouside to expand your knowledge and doing some part-time jobs to get new lessons. In my opinion, most of people fall down in their life because of lacking of experience. In short, i support this idea because it make us mature, independent. Besides, we have more chance to success and to do new things.

459,2396,E3097287CBD1,"Some school offer distances learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think student would not be benefit if they had distances learning. Many student would not focused during the lesson they would just do whatever they want so they wont learn as much as if they had a teacher. If student had online classes they would not get the attention necessary if they need help. Some student often have a bad day so they often dont pay attention and they just dont do the work that is assigned to them. they often just search the answer without learning but they think thats okay because no one is watching them. Many of them dont learn the subject but still somehow they passed the class. Other Important, reason why student wont benefit from online classes is that the may have some big problem in their life and they need someone to talk to but their one home so they feel sad, but if they were in school they can talk to a teacher,coach,counselor, or any other they feel happy to talk too. Other student may be sad they dont have someone to talk too. Online classes dont benefit students because they dont have the help they need. When student take online they can paid someone to do their work, and pretend that they did the work. One reason they can ask their brother to the work for them so they are not really learning anything. Other example, student may request some extra help but they wont get it because they dont a teacher with them. so they just dont understand but when it comes to do the text they failed. Other example might be that they are having family problem so they wont do the online classes. And they would not be focus. Having online classes wont help student in their life. one example is that they wont have friends and when they go to the real world they are going to have trouble talking to people because they dont know how too. Other important reason why school should not have online classes is that many student need to talk to a counselor for that they want to be when they grow up. and most. Most counselor guide their student the right way they teach the career we want to have in our life. but they take online classes they dont have the opportunity to chat with them. When students get video conferencing they dont really understand because something the video dont really explain what the student want to learn. one reason is the student might feel lazy to replay the video so he does not understand. and if he was at school teacher would help them with all their work . School should not have video conferencing. Student are going to feel bad when they get older that they took online classes.. one reason they going to feel bad is that they did not enjoy high school life. lets Image if a student was really good at soccer or any other sport and if they had played high school they could of get a scholarship, and maybe become one of greatest, but they didit because they were talking online classes. school should not have online classes because it take the right of student in playing high school sport. Overall, student would not benefit from online classes. they wont learn that much at home, and student need the attention to do work, they also need people to help them with their work. In my personal option school should not have online classes or video conferencing. Student are going to have a better knowledge if they go to school and, they work with teacher. School should let student enjoy take their high school life and not have online classes.",5,5,6,4,4,6,3267,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
460,1323,61C4FCA012D7,"The school food should change because a lot of students they did not like it and many students feel sick when they eat school food and many students skip their lunch to go and buy food from stores if schools provides the same food for student many students will leave class and learn they will not lean anything for being late in the class and more. The school lunch should to be healthier for student to eat. Otherwise many students will not go to their class or lunch because they skip class to go buy food. Many students at my school argue that the food should change. And others student say the food should stay the same because they like it and it healthier for them. For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have. If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like. Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat. To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.",7,5,7,6,5,7,1275,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
461,797,DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and dont be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and dont concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that. When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and dont putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and dont have distractions all year.

462,1109,7C4960DF5CB8,"I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework . I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3 pieces of homework . Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A . It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem . In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder. Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER but it does and. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .",5,6,7,7,6,5,1637,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
463,436,FA078892658B,"It is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. If regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after 10 pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically. The first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. For example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. Also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. Furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up. The second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. For example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. Many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. So, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them. The third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. If teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. For example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because hes a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. These curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe. The last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. For example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or herself a job that will allow him or her to work during night hours, keep him or her out of the streets and help him or her economically. Economically means that the person will be working, earning money and also staying out of his or her house during late night hours. Teenagers can improve themselves economically if they spend their time working instead of spending it in the street doing things that will not help them in anyway. Finally, by working and improving their economy teenagers will be able to save some money for their own future and have money available for emergencies that can occur throughout their lives. Furthermore, it is better that these curfews are adopted for the security of teenagers. Also because these regulations will help teens improve themselves economically by keeping them out of the streets and motivating them to find a job if they want to be out of their house during late night hours, they will also help them socially because people will not be avoiding them if they are not seen in the street, medically because they will prevent them from getting into fights and having to go to the hospital and finally academically because teenagers will not be wasting time on the streets and they will have more time to do their homework and improve their grades at school.

For example, buying an insurance plan, going based in someone elses coverage will cover something you dont need, while if chosen based on your needs there wouldnt be a problem. Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan says ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shots you take. Furthermore Making os own decisions are important ,because, People will not always be there, and you will be forced to make your own decisions.

The people who said that technology has a negative effect on peoples lives have their reasons. One of the most important reason and approved from experts is that technology is making people to not socialize. According to scientist now in days people rather to play on their electronic devices instead of going out. According to an article people expend at least 10 hours playing videos and using social media. However, technology helps the people to communicate with others that live far away. A lot of people have now the opportunity to communicate with their family thanks to technology. Technology allows people to video call others and to have connection with others and socialize with people around the world via internet. A good example can be soldiers. Sometimes soldiers are out of the country and the only way they can communicate with their families is by video calls.

468,2481,C02F3803D0D1,"People think that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree with that because impressions is just what you think, always make you think different things, and you never know whats gonna happen. Impressions is like when you thought somethings, its just what you think about someone or something. For example:My impression is that she is not telling me the truth. you think that shes not telling you the truth but you dont know the truth. Impressions can make you think different or bad just because how you look at someone or something. For example: If you see someone that has a bad looking, your impression is that he might be poor but, you can change your impression if you see that he has the Iphone of the year, or he has a Lamborghini, so it can make you think different. When women get pregnant they always get impress and trying to guess what the baby is gonna be. For example: When my mom got pregnant and she had me, her impression was that it was gonna be a girl, and she wanted a girl, but here i am, 18 years old, a big boy and she was impress and sad, but when she see that i was very handsome her impression change shes happy now. Some people believe that just with their impression you are what they say. Next time you think that the first impression is impossible to change, you have to think the first impression does not say everything about a person or something.

I think getting advice from others has a great point of view and a bad point of view by the way someone can look at. When you are trying to get advice from someone remember to ask more then one person for advice. One of my reasons is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. My other reason is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. My last reason is asking people for advice can hurt its not always going to make you happy. My first statement is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. Most of the people in this world have different point of view for each person on the way they see them or maybe by the way they you act and look. Asking only one people is not a good idea because someone might just be looking at you how you look and how you dress. They might just say bad things to you because they thing your not worth nothing and they are the only ones that actually are worth something in this world. People in this time dont gave good advice to people because all they want to do is make people look bad in front of others. My second statement is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. Will in my point of view asking people for advice is not a great idea because some people might just till you lies when you are asking for advice. Sometimes people just tell you lies because they know that you need help but all they are going to do is make you look bad. They are some people that all they want you is to suffer just because they are having problems at home. Getting advice form one person is not a good idea because you might not know if they hate you or that you might have done something that hurt them and you didnt know and you asked them for advice they would gave you bad advice just for what you did to them. My last statement is that asking people that you thing that will tell you the truth no matter if it hurts or not is not a bad idea. They are some people that would tell you the truth even if its going to hurt a lot but the only thing they want for you is too be happy. Asking people older then you is a great idea like your family because maybe they have been though a lot maybe they might even hate you or something else but they would never lie to you because you are there children they care about you. Getting advice is not bad it also can depend on the way you decide to take it if you take it as a good or bad way because most of the people that are always there in your bad a good moment always want the best thing for you because they love you. In conclusion, asking for advice sometimes and talking to others more advice can help you make good choice but at the same times bad choice it all depend on you if you want to be a great or bad person. Everyone has there point of view to take the advice that someone gives you in a good or bad way. Mostly the people that love you are going to tell you the truth even though if it hurt because they know that later or after you are going to find out the truth. In this world you should take most of the advice that other people gave you because they have already been thought a lot but they dont want you to through the same thing because they actually want you to be someone if life even if they couldnt be someone in life. The advice that someone gives you is not bad it to help you see how hard they work because they didnt take the advice that they gave you are they didnt get the chance like you have so if someone gives you a great advice you should be grateful.",6,6,7,6,4,4,954,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

472,2338,924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school dont have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school. First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you cant take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries culture and how did they treat people in their ways. Thats why I think elective classes was important. secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time. In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I dont understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college. Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didnt go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early. Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.",8,6,7,7,6,8,1937,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

First, we accomplish more if we are always doing something because people accomplish more when they are working for it. The people wants to get more when they are doing something important. After this people get better because they are always doing it. Also they are doing good things and they get more things done. Then the people that always is doing something they always wants more accomplishments. Additionally people accomplish more when they are working for it also the people get more satisfaction in what they are doing.

Getting satisfaction from something that they do make them happy and they will make them keep doing it. Also they satisfaction of the accomplishment is very important because they will always want keep getting more accomplishments. Then the more work that we do that more we accomplish from the other people. In conclusion, we accomplish more if we are doing something because people accomplish more when they are working for it and people get more satisfaction in what they are doing. In my opinion people accomplish more in what they are doing because they are doing good things and they want to get more accomplishments of their actions.

474,653,F5CB9849B913,"To accomplish something there is always gonna be some inactivity once and a while. Well everyone has their own different type of way to accomplish something, but there is always some kind of inactivity at times; but not always. I think that we really do accomplish more when there is something else happening. Everyone in this world is different compared to the next person. Everyone has their own unique style of completing an assignment. Some examples are Listening to music , working outside, working with someone else, and basically anywhere else. These small things can help somebody to Stay in task to complete something. Myself personally I love to be listening to music to get my assignments done. I am able to accomplish more than what I usually do. Before i never got my school work completed cause i was really bored of doing it, but when I first played music. I was flowing threw to get my work done. Sometimes when trying to accomplish anything in life. Some people may experience some inactivity. Two things that happen the most to people are Zoning out or a phone notification. These two things are what happens to people the most, But they can always prevent it from happening. Me for myself i love using my phone. I never get bored of it. Sometimes while im working to get my assignments done and complete. There will always be a notification that will make my phone go ""Buzz buzz"" and then ill have the courage to see what it is. Now I have overcome that. What i do now is i put my phone on silent away from me while its connected to my Bluetooth speaker playing music. This always helps me from zoning out. Music playing in the background prevents me from zoning out. some people can complete everything without a doubt, But not everyone could stay on task to complete something to accomplish it. We all had accomplish something in this world; but some people havent accomplish anything at all. Their minds are not set for reality I must say. Their minds are inactive and not set for anything. People can change. Anything can happen. Nothing in this world is really impossible, well if you set your mind to it. People dont believe in themselves to Accomplish anything. The inactivity that they got can change. Before i used to never get anything completed/Accomplish. I was thought I wasnt enough to do anything. I always made bad choices. My mind wasnt set for anything. I didnt care. I thought my life was a joke and soon it will be over as soon as I know it. School was hard. I didnt really get anything done. I was never the perfect student. My grades were bad. I had no faith in myself. I thought i could not do anything right. I never accomplished anything. The only thing I could accomplish is messing up everything. School, at home, In a public area, Anywhere. I made bad choices back in my pass; But now its completed different. I have learn and seen everything that I did. My mind wasnt set on success only failure. Only I realized that I could change not just who i am but everything. If i set my mind into it. I started to accomplish assignments at school. I was doing very well then I thought i could do. I started to see a huge change in myself. It felt like i was a whole new person. I had accomplish to change my life. I saw the success. It wasnt hard. I just had to believe in myself to do it. If I could change then i know people in this world can change also. Although accomplishing something no matter if its simple, Difficult, short, or long. Its still better off to accomplish it even tho there is always gonna be a little bit of inactivity, and its okay there are always a way to over come it. Everyone can always change. With the power of your mind and yourself you can always accomplish more if you are always doing something else with maybe a little of inactivity.",5,6,8,7,6,6,3661,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

476,441,8EB2AF12FA77,"To being with, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of then hours. Schools are planing to do two hours of school each week. The disadvantages of doing such a thing to school are, Schools are reducing school hours, teachers wont be getting a salary instead they will get pay hourly, and the economic is going to be low. I believe that, school days shouldnt be reduce ,just because they want to save energy. Students must be at school for eight hours. Otherwise the teachers wont have the time to give the given material. Students studies will get interrupted if they get two hours of school weekly. Second reason, is that teachers wont be getting a salary for two hours of work. The pay checks will be reduce to hours worked during the week just like any other job that pays by hour. That means that those people need a secondary job so they can support themselves Finally, the economic will increase because businesses are reducing peoples hours just because they want to save up energy. People have debts to pay like credit cards, health/car insurance etc. Food cost will highly increase its price. In conclusion, employers shouldnt reduce peoples hours. it is a good idea to reduce the energy that we consume but in away its also affecting our economic and learning system.",6,7,7,6,7,7,1894,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
477,1963,C85795794D51,"Forty-five percent of people in the world enjoy doing outdoor activities. Something like going to community parks, state parks, and even national parks. The other percentage of people are indoors sleeping, watching TV, or playing video games. I personally can do both, there are other days when I just want to stay in the house and there are other days when I want to get out the house and do things like playing soccer with my brother and father. Enjoyable ways to spend you time outdoors can be going to festivals hanging out with friend or even reading a book in the park. Some interesting and enjoyable outdoor activities that I like doing is going to the zoo, going on a picnic, hanging out with friends and family, playing some type of sport, or visiting a amusement park. Away that I would spend my time outdoors is hanging out with family and friends. By doing that I can go to the zoo with friends or go to a park and play sports with them. There are many thing you can do you just have to find the right activity the you like and enjoy. Another activity that I enjoy is playing soccer with my dad and brother we always go to the park and play with my cousin then after that we would go out to eat and its better than sitting home all day and doing nothing. These activities can be enjoyable because you together with family and friends and that can make things fun. People can use these activities to take their minds off certain situation like problem at home or something going on at school . People can use going to the park and reading a book as an escape of reality and life and going into their imagination. There are many reason why these activities can be enjoyable. Just sitting home all day doing nothing can cause you to be lazy and hide away from the world but also going outside is good for you mental growth. My mother has always told my sibings and I that we should go outside more often and I think to myself why is it important for us to go outside if there are more problems in the world the being indoors. I think that being outdoors can help you open you mind up more to new things and experiences. For example my friend PROPER_NAME had skin cancer and he was so scared of being out side and he wanted to hangout with his friends, play sports, and go to the park and have picnic. This story is what motivates me to go out side because I dont want the freedom of going outside to be taken away. everyone like a little bit of fun for example last week me and my friend went bowling and then we went to the mall it was pretty enjoyable because I forget about everything and focus on myself and the people I am with. I find it interesting the when we were younger we loved being outdoors playing with our friend and now that we are older and have electronics we decide to stay inside because its more entertaining. In conclusion, there are many enjoyable things to do outdoors you just have to find the right activity that suites you or maybe even try new things do to by yourself or find someone to do it with.

480,2427,2D508127DEF1,"There is a debate today day about whether the students should study from home or school. Many people agree that the appropriate way to study is going personal to the school. My idea is that they are well understanding when the students go to the school because they have mutiple attention. Here are some reasons why many students master a course in school rather than online courses. First they can ask questions at any time, second improvement on learning new topics, and last friends support in group work. First, many teenagers who take online courses still have questions or guesses on their answers. Here some reasons why many on the students does not master some courses. The classes related with Math, Chemistry, and History are the complicated for most learners. Those who are assisted by a teacher are the ones with the chance of clarify any problem related with numerical or logic problem; also the teenagers can make corrections in their work by asking for solutions. While the students with online courses are involved with more guesses, but the course program does not provide clear answer or does not provide an answer. Second, the improvements in schools classes vary depending the faculty member you are with. Online games made by the teachers related with the actual topic makes the topic easy by practicing in the game, also entertain them at the same time keeping their minds relaxed and widely open to process more information within the game. Other teachers prefer individual activities with certain amount of exercises provided in previous classes. Those improvements help to find new ways to solve a problem, hints, and interpretation of the problems. The online courses does not provide incentives for students allowing them to decrease the interest in the process. Finally, friends. They provide self confidence by asking an unclear problem and having different points of view at the same time. The opinions provided for the people you know encourage them to keep it up; theres some times the teacher explanations does not clarify at all and your group provides detailed explanations of a process. The efficiency in the group is enforced by dividing the labor and finishing soon; them the work can be shared with the people at the table, explaining how the process was made, and at the same time they can make corrections in what the other person have done. Different than the online practice made by the person self can take weight longer to get an specific difficulty. Those are the reasons why many people prefer the schools rather than house. The help in questions by the teachers, improvement in learning in different ways, and the support of people you know and you feel confident with. Those reasons allow students to be better at something they arent with the help of someone that knows more about the course.

If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices. Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful. Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.,7,7,6,7,7,5,1958,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
483,1889,F89738650EDF,"Self-esteem comes from achievement. My reason for saying this is because you shouldnt be getting praised for a low assignment that they did; then they are not going to grow. My other reason was that teachers are here to help students improve and if the student know they didnt the best they couldve and get praised for it; then theyre going to think that they dont have to do that much and will have a low self-esteem. To elaborate more on my first reason for why I say self-esteem comes from achievement is because if you do excellent on a paper and are positively sure you did amazing then you should be getting praised. That shows how much a student can have a high self-esteem for themselves. Even though, the paper probably wasnt easy that person didnt get lazy. They wanted to do better which means that they want to grow and improve not just stay where they are. I am going to explain my second reason for why self-esteem comes from achievement. This is all about the students and how they improve. Therefore, if a student knows they couldve done better on an assignment and get praised for the lazy work that did then they are going out think that they dont need to do that much work anymore. Although, as the teacher; they shouldnt be praising students on lazy work. They should pull them aside and say "" hey this was good but it wasnt you best work; I know you can do better"". My counterclaim is teachers shouldnt let students get away with lazy work. I say this because sometimes some students might think that the teachers dont pay attention to them or they dont care about their work. Even though, if the student approaches the teacher with a problem then the teacher will remember you and know to check up on you when it comes to your work. In conclusion, true self-esteem does not come from praise on an effortless assignment. If you praise students on a low assignment then thats the level they are going to stay at because they got praised to be lazy. Which means that the teacher leaves the student not wanting to improve and expand on their writing skills.

484,1148,7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In todays societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them. Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, its dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, its interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore. Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesnt mean its healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesnt have any and stays at home playing video games. Thats why some parents disagree with todays societies. The reason why is because, they dont like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future. However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion. Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact its maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed. It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career. As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about.

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasnt the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country.

Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever.

To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future. an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia. Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person. I also like to thing that Im a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. Im a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that Im having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student . People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his lifes. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his lifes. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered. people have to do different things in their lifes if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they dont have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person.

Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesnt know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesnt know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade. Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated. Those are the three good reasons why my lesson to the elementary students is important.",8,8,6,7,8,7,873,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

490,738,A33D66485059,"Tomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonerful how much may be done if we are always doing."" In this prompt I thinki that Tomas Jefferson was triying to said is that people have to determinate to never be idle to always do something, because after that you will see how much things you may done, and there always 2 types of people . The pople who would be agrere or not agree with this frase. That is why some people may think that is not always necessary to do something or work hard for things that we want, because they think that we can work for our things when is their necessary time . Also some people may think that you need to do something when things are really necessary or when you want something. I hardly believe that the frase that Tomas Jefferson wrote is totally true. We need always been working in our life to get wonderful thing , as he said is wonderful how much we can done whit things if we are always doing something for it. It is also that we that he worote that sentences, because I can totally feel how he specificly said "" Determinate never to be idel "" I take that sentence like never let yourself be that. In the world are so many people negative that always think that we cannot get that things that we want that is always the reason why people become lazy with their dream , because they always think with negativily. there are many people outside looking for a excuse to be idle. In conclusion I hardly believe that Im totally agree with Tomas Jefferson because we can keep working or doing something because after that, we would see the things that we have done or our resuts that our hard work. Just we need to keep doing something or working for something great in our future as a person succeful that we want to be.",5,5,5,4,4,4,2185,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
491,1463,F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do. Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good. And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind. Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Names family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Names family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Names family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them. In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

Technologyy allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person. Because technology makes people to become more single, we can do a work or we can finish something by ourself. For example, if I want to buy a book for my friends that he live very far from me. I do not need to go to the bookstore buy a book then call him ask him when does he have time, and we make a time to meet each other. Right now I can buy a book online and then I type his address to delivery. I just need to wait a few days and then he can get the book. This is the technology makes life more confortable.

494,540,C82037D6072F,"Befits For An Extra Hour of School 85% of students who study more can pass more test. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test. First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important. Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test. Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more. In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. It is also good for some student. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success.

495,1121,003885A45F42,"The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others. First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what youre doing. Because youre defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they dont make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they dont want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because theyre afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. Its hard to make your own choices, but one day youre going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what youre doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day Its your life and you do what you think is right. Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like theyre happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, theyre depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says ""Those who know God should love others, because God is love."" Not being yourself will get you depressed because you dont do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they dont want to do just to fit in, because they dont want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they wont be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what hes doing since its his friends. Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids dont like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says "" Honor your father and mother."" If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you dont want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid dont watch, and stand up for them, dont be afraid to stand up for someone because youre doing the right thing. Some may disagree with me and say that its not that big of a deal, and it doesnt feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that its a big accomplishment because nowadays its really hard to become yourself. In conclusion, Its hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and youre afraid to fight it back. Thats why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students dont want to learn.

For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you dont know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; ill work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer. Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class Online if its difficult for you to remenber something during that time. In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years.

499,713,D9E7B148EF8C,"I DISAGREE Hello there!!! do you know that Albet Einstein is one of the smartest person that ever live, he discover by using knowledge and imagination. Then he said this "" imagination is more important than knowledge."" I disagree because you see you use imagination and knowledge in the rest of your life, when you work as a team you use imagination and knowledge and you need to be fast, strong, and smart, and imagination and knowledge is important. OK let me explain why i disagree what Albert Einstein said. First, when you was a kid you use imagination to make things, to draw, to make discoveres, and to have fun. When you grow older you will get knowledges and use it to pass your test, do your homework, and more, but you use your imagination too. For example by thinking, to brain strom, to make music and more, is the same thing however you use knowledge with imagination. Both imagination and knowledge, you have those things from your rest of your life!!! Starting when you were a kid and when you grow older you still use both imagination and knowledge, thats one of my important reason why i disagree. Second, you use imagination and knowledge when you work with somebody or working as a team, making something or thing how can we make it stronger or how can we win. if your working as a team and battling a robot battle you use imagination to think whats the best robot to build and how to make it stronger, that one of the examples. If you play sports you use knowlege to think what to do, how to win, its the same but you use knowledge. However theres a battle that you work as ateam, using imagination and knowledge, it is a war!!! let me explain its beacause you use imagination to know whats the plan, what is the things were using and knowledge to know when to attack , that one of my reason, when using imagination and knowledge in a team you need to be fast, strong, and smart. The last one, imagination and knowledge is important, because imagination and knowledge is both important because if kids cant imagine theres no knowledge or if there no knowledge there no imagination. Every body need imagination and knowledges to do what they want and both of these is fun like they can make things, they work as a team, and it will be at there rest of there life. This last body or body 3 is conneted in body 1 and body 2 this is the most important reason. If theres no imagination theres no knowledges, both of does is important every one need imagination and knowledge. Thats all my reason why i disagree that ""imagination is more important than knowledge"" both of those is important, you use it by playing, making, thinking, and more, thats all i have to say that i disagree on albert eintein.",6,5,6,4,4,5,3055,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
500,1878,1F7FD80F4396,"I totally agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson , being yourself around people of these days is complicated in the way that anything you do or you say is going to be judge by everyone , you will be the critique of your classmates,friends,family. Is basically most of the youth community feeling the pressure of being accepted by the society and they forget to be them and they start becoming someone else, just because the other person might have a lot of friends or they want to have the same popularity as them. 70 percent of the youth community either have depression or they get bully in high school. For the people who sees these type of actions and dont say anything because they are unprotected and are scared to be bully, first know that you can get help and you can be that person giving the courage to the other person feeling same as you. There are multiple reasons why you should want to be yourself and not just a copy. First put in your mind that you are unique , by the time you grow up the reality will come to show you that you dont need to impress anyone but yourself and all your actions is for you, your mistakes will affect you the most .When you are copying someone you should analyze what you win from it and is it really worth it ?.Now , ask yourself if the friends you have are really your friends,just because they walk with you and they talk to you doesnt mean they are your friends , and worse if they tell you to change who you really are. A real friend is that person that would love you and care about your own good, a friend is the one that appreciates you will all your defects. Someone changing you is someone you surely dont want in you life. Believe it or not is better to be alone than with bad friends,inclusive your own family can talk bad about you ,they might critique everything you dress,eat,but that isnt reason to change yourself and be what they are expecting you to be. When you are going to be a grown up, how can you tell someone to be always themselves when you dont even got to known the value of it. Being yourself is worth it, is loving who you are you wont be able to love someone else if you dont love yourself before. Having your own thoughts and always giving your honest opinions are good than just agree with something that you dont , being real is being you. Be real with your friends and if they dont like your opinions or they would make fun of you then feel happier that they finally showed their truth colors. If you cousins or any member of your family make fun of you because you unknown any argument they are talking about or they make fun of they way you dress then they arent family. Popularity is nothing compared to be yourself, somehow in any time you will feel so stressed ,sad ,and down and thatll be because you cant fake no more. Get you own experience, have your own goals in life, create your future. Instead of worrying about being accepted just worry about what you are planing for the future. Be a right person at least, dont copy someone ignorant , be a good well , always appreciate the appraisal of what you parents thought you and dont you ever feel shameless for it. In the future the success will be good recompense .

502,1713,EAB74EEE65B3,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. Everyday after school my brother and I go to the library to do our homework, when we get there I dont have any contact with him nor him with me. Nowadays, when I go to the library I can see many people sitting there, staring at the screen of a computer without having contact with the other person that it is near them. Having access to technology has positive effects but it also have negative effects. The limitation use of technology has negative effects on peoples lives because it keeps us away from the ones that are near us, it can damage our way of living, and also it can make us to become addicted to it. While we are in touch with technology, we are keeping away our self from the ones that are near us. For example, I have this friend we have always eat lunch together none of us have a cellphone, but one day my friend came to school with a cellphone that her mom bought for her. We were eating lunch, I was talking to her, but she was not listening to me because she was more into her cellphone than me. Technology can allow us to have contact with the ones that are far away from us, but we need to manage our time we can talk to them when we are alone and not when we are near a person that we can talk to. Having any type of technology near us while we are with somebody else it is not a good idea. Therefore, one day I decided to let my friend being herself with her cellphone, and I stop eating lunch with her. Technology send me away from her even though maybe she did not want that to happened. From that day I learned that if I want to keep the person that it is always near me, I just need to give them more attention instead of giving all my attention to a cellphone. To continue, technology can damage our way of living, it can effect us in a way that we have not even think about it. For instance, when I turned seventeen years old my parents bought me a cellphone, from then I was too lazy to do my homework and refuse to talk to them because I have a cellphone and I can be in contact with the ones that are not near me. Access to technology made me lazy and careless about school. One day my parents decided to took my cellphone for a week I was really mad at them that I stop eating and then I got sick. Meanwhile, technology can help people with their tasks, but it can also make people careless about important things that can be useful for their future. Some say that the use of technology have a great positive effect in our life, but I disagree with it because the use of technology it just stop us from being active with others and become careless about things that we were interesting in. For example, I was really interested on taking dancing lessons, so I decided that I can just watch dancing videos in my computer and it will be the same, but actually I did not watch the dancing lesson videos, I ended up watching something else that it does not have anything to do with dancing lessons. While some people think that technology have positive effects, I dont think the same. With the use of technology everyday we become addicted to it. Therefore I think technology does not have positive effect on peoples life it might have some positives effects but there are more negative effects than positives. In conclusion, Technology allows people to complete many tasks and can help us to connect with others around the world but are we really giving some time to the ones that are near us? I dont think so. Lets be positive dont let technology take away the people near us. Lets think smart we can do better in our life without being sitting there for an hour or more staring to a computer, cellphone or another electronic device when we can be enjoying the people that it is always there for us, near to us, and giving their time to us.

503,1705,953BEF800163,"Finish high school one year early sounds pretty good. Students can start doing something out of high school that helps them in the career they will choose in the future. But, its better to finish the traditional four years in high school, because students can prepare more they self before go to college, its too early for students to finish high school at the age of 15-17 years old, and students might not have the enough education that they need. To begin with, students will be more prepare to go to college after the four years of education from high school. They can prepare more they self and see what they need to work on or what they wanna do in the future. For example, these four years in high school helped me to find a passion about what I would like to become in the future, and also helped me to be more mature and feel ready for the next step. Also, its too early for students to finish high school one year before, because students might be in the age between 15-17 years old and they may not be that ready to start a responsive life in college. For example, my sister is 16 years old and shes a junior. When we dont have nothing to do or we are having a conversation, I always ask her if she is ready to go to college or at least, if she have an idea of what major she would like to study and her response is that; shes not even ready for her senior year, and I understand her, because that happened to me when I was her age and when I was a junior. Moreover, students might not have the enough education that they need to learn in high school, and that can be a problem in their classes in college. For instance, Ive heard from some friends in college, that sometimes they really lost in some classes, even though they graduated from high school when they were 18 years old. That means, if students graduate in three years, they would be confusing in their classes when theyre in college. To conclude, graduate in four years from high school it feels longer, but it will be a big reward at the end, because students will be more ready to go to college, also they will be in an age where they will be more responsible, and mature. Lastly, they will have more acknowledge in everything. High school, its one of the best step of your life, where after you graduated from there, you would like to come back and stay more than four years.",9,7,6,6,6,7,1975,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
504,532,C05745235FE7,"Is it good idea for high school students, the can graduate in three years instead of traditional four years? Some school distract offer program that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of four years. Most high school students who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or may not be able to take elective courses. If students end up their high school in three year, the would missed most of opportunities that could provide better knowledge and education for them. Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students couldt get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. To begin with, first reason, students couldt receive enough credits to graduate. For example, when college student want to be successful Doctor, he or she must get enough classes during the 7 years to receive approximately credits to get their diploma, if the require to graduate in 5 years, the cant construct enough confidence to be a good Doctor for the community and society. This example shows, students shouldt graduate early, because the cant developed and improve their life skills, education, and knowledge. If students graduate early, the would get an anxiety and different kinda problems in their life. High school traditional four years is the natural path that can help student to be success and give them more educational opportunities. Furthermore, second reason, students cant improve or developed their confidence and their knowledge. For example, when the student who graduated early try to do an experiment he/she wouldt believe their decision and the doest have any positive confidence to get the result successful. This example shows, students should not graduate early, because the wouldt have any strong confidence to do something successful. Students shouldt required to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years of high school. If students graduate in three years of high school, the will face to anxiety problems, challenges, and work challenges. Some peoples argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills. For example, when I was in Afghanistan I was about to graduate high school in 2 years, also I had the most opportunities to receive grateful education. However, students shouldt be require to finish their high school in three years instead of four years because students would be leftover from others and the would never confidence on the experiment and life skills. Students shouldt graduate in three years, the should take the elective classes to get more information about the world, regions and humans. In conclusion, Students should not require to graduate in three years instead of four years because students couldt get enough credits to graduate, and students can not improve their confidence and their knowledge. However, Some peoples argue that, students should be require to graduate in three years because students will receive the most opportunity to continue their education skills.

When it comes to choosing, it might be as hard as a stone at the begining because, we are not sure if it is going to work or not. But nothing comes in an easy way if you want the reall succesful ,we need to follow our character. Whenever we choose our own character, we have the confidence to do on what we are planing to do. And when we have the confidence, it is way easier to manage any case that comes to our life. We do not choose our charater whitout knowing ourself, and that is why it is better to choose our character by knowing what is best for ourself. For exampe: Sometimes in life we get so many bad things on our way, but if we choose to take it easy on them by choosing our best character, that helps a lot because it is making our life easier in an easy way without much stressing. As long as we know our charachter, we will always have the right chocie to make, because we know what is going to match with our character or with our wantings. Sometimes when we are planing to get married, we do not just guess to match with our parteners ,but we choose our character to match with our partners character, that is because we know that we can choose our character in any how that makes us feel the best way to our living. Or sometimes you can fall in love but you partener might have a better character then you, so you decide to change your character by choosing your parteners character, and that is why we should choose our own character. A lot of people choose thier character when they start school, because they see a lot of diffrent characters in school and they start noticing which character belongs to them. Or they can learn from what thier teacher teaches them, and we all know that our teachers are always willing to teach us the best behaviour and that is why the most students start to choose thiere character at school. . When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character. You can not pretend to be the character that you do not choose to be, that is just like living a fake life. Life is easier and happier when we follow our own rules.

515,1355,D8D84A2E4CE0,"I think that working in group would be beneficial, because yall can help each other and learn about work and can be practice words that they dont know. Another beneficial that helps you to work in group is that they can finish he work more faster then working alone, because if you work alone it takes to much time to finish the work. Sometimes when the teacher tell you to make a project and tells you that shes going to put groups to work you know that you dont have to speak by yourself because you know that your friends will help you to make it together. I think that work with someone else helps you to relax because sometimes you dont know something, but you can ask your friends if they know and they help each other, but sometimes its better to work alone because no one distract you and if you have friends that would be distracting because if you trying to make your work and they playing aroud that will be extrecing even that you know that its going to be more hard to finish your work you feel relax because everything that you doing its right. If i have to choice from working in groups or working by myself i wirll prefear to work in groups because i think that would be more help full for me. Its beneficial for me to work in gorups, you know sometimes you been stresing for to much work and you know that no one can help you because you have to work alone, and if you work with someone you can talk with him or her ask about what this thing means or ask them for some opinios and get it together. Working alone you are thinking i have to do this and this i dont have no one to help me and sometimes you dont finish your work because the project was hard, thats why its better to work with groups both have benefices, but you didt working alone for me its not a good choice, but its not a bad choice. Even if you have to work by yourself you have to try your best. I know that a lot of people choice to work by there self, but one time you going to be wrong and you gonna need help, both choices benefical you one way or the other way. One day i was maiking a project by myself and that take me to much time to finish the project, and i was stresing because i didnt understand somethings that they was asking me and i have no one to ask about it. I have do a lot of projects by myself and in groups and i know that working in groups helps you more 3 or 4 breins works more then one brein.

516,1465,FF4CBDA0E418,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. In my opinion first impression might be possible to change because people are different human with different habits and it depends on ourselves how we act and treat the person that we want to impress. For example Generic_Name wanted to apply for a job in a clothing company named Dior which is a popular,expensive,and fancy brand he prepares himself for his first interview,he wears black suit and black shoes and starts heading to the office with his CV he have enough expeirence to be one of the employer in the company he impress his boss and thats how he gets his job. In addition to this statement the reason why the first impression is impossible is because the people did not met each other more than once they do not know their habits what they like about each other or what they do in their daily life or what they like to do like their expeirence. In conclusion I would say this statement is kind of equal disagree or agree becuase like I said people never know each other habits and what they like for example: what is their hobby, what they eat,what they like to wear, so at the end my opinion is I am disagree with this statement.

But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages their are, if your stuck and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because theres more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do. Working together gives us a bigger boost of an IQ because multiple brains are better then one and gives us a better over all grade or if the person that is working alone and is very smart he could find things easier. Working together could be fun because of the people you are working with or meeting new people in the group that you dont know and learning from them and what experience they been through. Disadvantages are people are going to force the smarter person of the group to do all the work, if people choose the group theyll choose either the smart people of people that they get along with and mess around and not do anything, if the teacher finds out that the smart ones from the groups do all the work theyll get an f. People who choose people to be in their groups are going to abuse their power.

However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time. The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money.

I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility. The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow.""

525,1213,DDB673D3627D,"Who wants to work alone by themselves when you have the chance to work together with a group of students in your class. Working together is more beneficial because with a group you can get all the work done more faster and students are less worried. Many students should work together as a team in school because it helps them with good life skills life. People might need this to help them when working at a job in the future. I agree that working with a group is more efficient and help students learn more better. Benefits of working with a group is more beneficial because allows students to collaborate, allows different ideas or opinions from peers, and allows each individual to have feedback from peers. However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people believe that benefits of working alone is more helpful for themselves. For example, when a students is working on the computer for a certain projects in fashion marketing, fitness and foods or other subjects in school because theyre able to finished it themselves. This explains that people can put their own ideas and will get the work done more quicker without any help from peers during class. Nevertheless the oppositions over looks other important points. First reason is that student can collaborate with other peers but only about 30% of people work together with other people on school projects assignments or activates. For example, in classrooms students have more possible chances to separate the task with each other. Also people wouldt have to worried about not getting each slides done because their peers would be there to support them. This shows that students who work together with peers they are not only benefiting themselves but helping other people too. Students can enjoy and have fun working with friends also everyone will get a good grade. Second reason is students can come together as a team by listening and hearing out all of their peers creative ideas and opinions in a group on the project. For example, each person might have a good suggestion or reason on a history project that will help their group with the assignment. This shows a person will have many ideas that they can chose from a peer in their group and its always nice to use different reasons from a student. Third reason is when a student can get a individuals feedback to help them on a english writing essay in class. For example, the person is writing a essay for class on Google docs with each other it helps them talk and get feedback from a peer or friend in class. This shows that having a students help is important because you can fix the error in the essay with a peers correction and students can learn more better together from people. To conclude that working with a group is more better for people because allows students to collaborate with peers so that people can separate the task with each other, allows different ideas or opinions from peers when each person has good suggestions for projects and allows individuals to get feedback from peers on helping a students with a english writing essay. Maybe good for students to work alone but working in a group is helpful to have someone support them. ",7,6,6,5,4,6,3143,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesnt even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking. Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think im already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I dont need to go school again just to spend money ,Im good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didnt talk to him about careers when he was at school. One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,thats why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career. Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids Im not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didnt have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didnt have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesnt have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",7,7,6,6,5,6,2683,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
527,25,6E842F21D6E4,"There are people in every part of the world that, they can not be retract based on what they say, or on what they have done as a result of their acts giving in their first impressions. The first impressions can give to a people in a idea, feeling, or an opinion. A people can hurt someone else feeling based on their opinion, because they do not think what adequate words they going to say. And when they want to fix the problem may be too late. The first impressions are almost impossible to change, because people can hurt someone else feelings and cause people change. First impressions can hurt peoples feelings in fact, I did to my sister yesterday. My sister and I were talking about her wedding yesterday, her wedding is next year in April, and we are preparing for her best day ever. We have to look for her dress and all the things that she is going to use for that day. She is like my second mother, and I want to make sure she looks beautiful on that day. While we were talking and looking for dresses in the internet, she saw a wedding dress, and my first impression was like, no that dress is ugly, and I told her she was going to look like a real skull in dress, because she is skinny. But I never thought I was going to hurt her feelings in my first impression, the dress was ugly, even though she liked but I wanted for her the pretties dress for her wedding. I felt badly for her, because I did not think my words before I said to her. I told her sorry, but she was little upset about me for the words I said to her, as I always say, what people say is what they receive. Lately my sister did not talk to me, I was sad and I talk to her, I apologized for the words I said. She told me it was okay, that I did not meant to said it. My sister and I, we are happy now. In the following manner, my friend Generic_Name invited me on her birthday and Her friend told me that I was looking ugly, and that I was a ugly and slow girl, in front of her other friends, her impressions about me hurt my feelings. She retract based on what she said, but it was too late, I left from Generic_Name party I went home, and I was little sad, the girl went to my home she wanted to talk to me, she apologized and I told her she hurt my feeling but I was fine, and gave her some advises and she left with this, first impressions are almost impossible to change because hurt someone else feelings. Additionally, first impressions can cause people change, as an example of my best friend I gave her an opinion about her boyfriend. I told her that he does not love her, because I saw him kissing with a girl in the school. She told me I was crazy, I was just jealous because she had the most handsome boyfriend in the whole world. Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change. Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big. Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.

528,2683,CB71E5F9AE1E,"Do you think failure is a good thing or bad thing? Well, what a British prime minster ones said""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Some people may think this is bad thinking because of how hard you try,but you have no success at the end. Yes,i agree with the statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because of these three reasons,failure makes me better than i was at first,never giving up without motivation ,and be able to over come that obstacle that i work so hard for. My first reason, of why failure is a good thing because it makes every body better at what they started with. For example, when i first started learning how to ride a long board i was very afraid that i would fall and hurt myself. At first i really terrible and failed over and over again. Until one day my friend came over my house and showed him how i would do it. But once again i fell off my long board crazy like. Then my friend started to laugh but in a funny way,so i also stared to laugh too. I ask him why he laugh at me,he told me"" i remember at was like you when i stared to learned long board"". He also told me he was really proud of me not giving up and failing. what i understood of what he was trying to tell me is that failure can make me better from having that kind of enthusiasm in my spirit. related back to my first reason is that not just giving up,but having a motivation every time i do anything to keep going. In order to have that kind of motivation of getting out of bed and doing what you want to accomplish at the end of the day is looking up to someone who helps you get to work or hustle i can say. For example, famous people who did or was successful in life like Bill gates who found the gold rush,Arnold the best body builder of all times,and Stan lee who invited the marvel universe. All these people was in our shoes before they became famous. They can motivate us by what people probably said to them like ""no"" or ""it can not be done"". They did not listen to adorers Sayers would though that never would happen. My final reason of why failure is a good thing is to over come any obstacle that can get in your way. For example, the time when i was fifteen years old i had a problem with one of my classes in school where i had to learn to stay away from people who were not good influence on me. At first they looked like good people,but when i started to notice that they were hiding something from me i was really currouse what was it about. Until one day i was with my best friend in his room just chilling and later on he showed me on his phone what i never though they would do. I was really dissapionted what they were doing beyond my back. So on that day i had to over come my obstacle of not making friends with anybody who looks nice or their appraise. In conclusion i do agree with the British prime mister Winston Churchill quote that says ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". because of these three reasons failure makes every body better,never giving up without motivation,and lastly over coming any obstacle that can be on road to success. something that i always believed in is ""no pain,no gain"".

It is an amusement park /zoo. There is a section for animals. You can go on a safari ride to see them. One of the best part about the ride is that you get to go to the elephants cage.

533,1034,49F54A35F6F3,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that its better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself. Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses. Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other persons side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person. However, even if they wont be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely. In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever its taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals.

Firstly, do you think having different options or opinion would help you accomplish more things? In my own opinion I think having a different opinion and opinion is better why, because someone else way might be better or faster to finish on whatever you are working on secondly, always having a second person while wanting to accomplishing something is better. why because one person might think differently then the other. Like if you worked with someone that was form a different country or state and they did the opposite of what you where doing but it was much faster you would like to learn how they do on whatever they did to finish faster. work could be faster and earlier accomplished by doing it and working it out. Lastly, accomplishing on whatever you may be working on may help you and the person that you will be working with. I think with accomplishing work you could discover something new or something you didnt know about, and might be good that you would like to share it with you priers and other important people around your area. In contrast, some people believe that that not being inactivity would help you better you self and accomplish more but I think not.

537,957,F886A2B6F351,"Its a good idea to have homework club at your school. Every school should have homework club at least three times a week. Homework club is a club where teachers help you with your homework or if you need help understanding a subject. Homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. Homework club is a big help for students. Theres so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early. At homework club you get so much help from the teachers. You can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. If a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. The best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. Its like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. Projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. If your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help. Another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. The teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. If you didnt know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. I can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. Many students cant really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they cant concentrate studying when they are alone. So if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. I recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. If you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz The last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and I guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. Math teachers, Science teachers, History teachers, and English teachers are going to teach students so much more. You can go to homework club and do your homework early so you dont have to worry about doing it at home. In homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more details. What I mean is that the teachers will teach you more about that subject. Homework club is one of the best club their is. It helps students learn more about the subject, it also makes them have more confidence, and it makes them be more active with your classmate at homework club. Homework club is a community full of amazing students and teachers. Theres so many things teachers at homework club help you with and that is Helping you get your projects done in time, helping you study for a test/quiz, and helping you finish your homework early. We can achieve this goal of establishing homework clubs in schools, but we need help from student to make this goal happen.

Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didnt. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses. First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didnt know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Names teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didnt know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes. Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good hell be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney. Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it. In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

539,1848,5ADD410B9783,"A student does not need to be success to be praised, an achievement doesnt always necessary to have a self-esteeming come from effort failure and motivation, First, success is not the only thing that can make a student be praise. It is their effort whats matters even though a student did not do well on hes work, but a least he tried to do it, may be he is good at it, but he is have been a hard time on his life at that time, if a teacher or someone said good job you did it well i am proud of you. He is gonna be happy of that someone understand him at his bad time, and support him. Second, failure is where a student achieve, learn, and gained experience, e never going to achieve at something without fail. Example, my on experience i have been seem achieve, and things that i did not succeed on it, in my life i had failed many school test or not get the score what i want to me it a fail, but to others it not, i always get mad at myself if i do not succeed at any tiny gold. When my teachers or someone tells me something nice, Good or they are proud at my work i felt so my proud of myself i am so proud that i have peoples who can understand me and support me. One day a teacher said "" im proud to have as my student and to be your teacher you had showed me that no matter what where you came from you can achieve anything you want, also in how hard you have worked maybe your work is no that good, but i had seeing you work harder keep being like this do not gave up on your dream or what you are doing "" she praised me with all her words made me cried , and to keep going believe in myself that i can do everything. Third motivation and self- confident, is what makes the difference, and changes a student life. being confident on what we are doing on our life or working on something even if we dont give our best at least we tried it, sometimes we achieve in something and we dont learned any new thing because we already know hoe it is done it, if a person praise someone it motivates them to keep going and and not give up on their dreams even if its hard and impossible self-esteem makes a person fight back. Finally, self-esteemed wont be always be for achievement, an self-esteem will be always on a student who are willing to do what is hard not the easy thing even though, they dont succeed and or achieve they know who they are and what they are able to do, lowers standard is better then nothing. some people may think achievement are required to praise while others think that is not, and for this reasons it doesnt be necessary to be success or achieve a gold to be praised by someone.

Teenagers would be in trouble and also in danger if they dont follow the curfew. It is dangerous for teens to stay out late because the world we live in now is not as safe as we think it is. There has been a lot of kidnapings and sex trafficking happening in the United states it is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew. If they want to go out somewhere past the curfew then they always have a choise to go with their parents. Usually, most teens dont have a license so they would uber their way to wherever their destination is and ubering at night is dangerous because, teens can get kidnap or anything bad can happen to them, so that staying out after curfew could get teens in trouble and in danger. If teenagers start to stay out after the curfew technically they would be breaking the law. They can get in a lot of trouble from their parents and the police for breaking the law. Teens tend to go to parties a lot and they drink under age which can get them in trouble with the law and also it is bad for their health. Another example why teenagers shouldnt be out after curfew is because, most teenagers when they go to paties they smoke which is really bad for their health. The parties they go to are sometimes on weekdays and it ends around 2-3 in the morning which is way past the curfew. If the teens come home that late at night they wont be able to get proper sleep because, they have school so getting less than 5 hours of sleep is not good for teenagers health at all. It is best for teenagers to stay home after curfew and get a good night sleep. Now days teenagers dont spent so much time with their parents. The curfew could help their parents spend some extra time with their kids. If the teenagers wants to hangout past curfew they can always go to their friends house or their friends could come to their house with their parents permission and they can hangout and be safe at the same time. Staying after curfew would definetly keep teenagers out of danger and trouble. Teens can aslo have extra time to their homework. It is best for teenagers to stay home past curfew for their own safety. All the reasons that are above is only because, so it shows what would happen if the teens dont follow the curfew.

Others might do it just to get their homework done early. That way they have free time at home to play games or to go out with friends. I think that this club can help so many students who have difficulty with certain subjects like Math, English, or Science. It can also help them get their homework done or any projects that they didnt finish in class. The teachers there can help the students with their work. Also they can work with a friend that is in the club with them. It would be a really fun thing because you get everything done faster.

They can also go to have a little fun with their friends after they are done with all their work that they had. This club can also help you study for a test that youre about to take or something else. They can also just go to play video games if they have no homework to do. I think that the schools should keep doing this club after school because it can help students get their homework done. That way the students can improve their grades that they have in the class. The students should also not be misbehaving while in the club. They shouldnt do any inappropriate things or say anything inappropriate during the afterschool club. If they do they should get a consequence. I would like to have afterschool homework club because it can help a lot of students with their work. They can get their homework done faster and get more help. You can also go and get your homework done earlier. You can study for a test that youre about to take. You can finish any projects that you didnt get to complete in class. Afterschool homework club is a really cool thing that every school should have.",7,7,7,7,8,8,3168,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
544,2430,043B9F48FDC2,"Should all the students have to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Or should it be an electives and they could be able to make their choice to take what they want. I believe that everyone have different opinion , interest, or things they want to do. They are able to make their on decision but i dont think that it has to be required to take a class that some people arent interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldnt take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and theres not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didnt want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why dont you go to that class and he was like i dont like the class, i dont enjoy it at all and also i didnt choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you dont even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like its your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me. But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now hes taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because its really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i dont know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i dont like because id rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look theres a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you dont want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i dont like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up. We should be able to choice what we want to study we dont have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we dont want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they dont know that they have to take some classes they dont even want to take then those type of things make people think thats why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just dont want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just dont feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just dont care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they dont think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it. Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then theres when the things starting coming out. Becuase they dont like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you cant do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students. Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if theres a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldnt be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldnt take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just dont like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own.",6,6,6,6,6,7,50,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

546,342,5A9C20C851FD,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldnt be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldnt attend they might be sleep, and they wouldnt care about the online classes. The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students dont get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so thats why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path. Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students dont has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldnt attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldnt learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesnt have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes. Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they dont want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesnt work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldnt have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school. I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldnt attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesnt have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesnt have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, thats one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit. In conclusion, however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldnt attend to the distance learning, because that wouldnt be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldnt learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach. I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldnt be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them. Many students will prefer to take the distance learning just because they dont want to wake up early and go to school.",7,7,6,6,5,7,1170,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
547,2903,72C0B0B91BFC,"There are so many things that can make good deed too someone with a good attitude even you can make yourself happy, But sometimes its hard to keep a good attitude while its a difficult time. I myself have witnessed someone with a good attitude it was my good old friend he was having a good attitude all day,But than someone in his family passed away he was really sad about it. Than his attitude was going bad I tired to make his day get better to go and get ice cream but than he was up for it so I was in a good attitude so was he so we were happy, But than his mom got really sick and the doctors said that she might not make it and than he shaded tears and than his day was just going horrible. So much was going on with his family like his mom is so sick she can barley move she was taken to the hospital because she had a high fever of 103. The day they took her to the hospital has got a heart attack at the night she was there and when she was there for a few days and than they brought her back home and that same night she got a heart attack again and my friends dad just said she cant leave the hospital or she might die if we take her back a few weeks passed and his mom recovered and now they are a happy family. I have witnessed my family member have a good attitude even during a difficult time. One of my family members were going though depression but no one else knew because everyday he always looked happy there was always a smile on his face when someone saw him there was not a time he looked upset or sad but just happy all the time. No one knew what he was going through they didnt know he was getting bullied,failing his classes and last of all no friends he thought he had no one and he kept telling himself he was alone. Everyone thought he was mad at something little like him not getting a toy or something because he was just a 10yr boy the rest of the family thought he was just a regular little kid running around all over the place laughing at everything and even cry at little stuff, but no he did nun of that all he did was just stay in his room lights turned off and the door was shut and locked. But than one day he forgot to lock his room and than I walked in and he was just crying and kept saying ""I got nobody I got nobody"" and than i made him feel better and then we put him in counseling for a few months and he started getting better and better while time went on. When you have a good attitude it can make your day be good and youll be positive with everything. Even in a bad times like for example if a family member or a friend is sick you can make there day by getting them there favorite food or snack that can get them in a good attitude with you because they may be a little grumpy while there sick. While your in a good attitude youll feel like you accomplish something for today and while other people will try to take you down you mind and your feeling will be strong and you wont be able to be in a bad attitude. Most people would want to be be in a good attitude but others are the world should just be happy and not always mad at something. I wish everyone in the world can be happy and something they did and not be mad at everything like sometimes when you play sports when you lose its a little upsetting at first but than you lose your attitude get stronger and you start being your self way more. I witnessed another of my friends trying to keep a good attitude his attitude was getting stronger and better because he played a lot of soccer but than his dad kept taking it to seriously. My friend was so tired that he wanted to take a break but his dad didnt let him he kept telling him get up lets go play everyday and on weekend his dad woke him up at 5 in the morning to go play soccer. Than on Monday when he got back to school he started getting eye bags under his eyes and than he was tired of it and went o his dad and i said Im tired of soccer and i give up. His dad looked so shocked and upset that he left him speechless and than he said fine when you grow up you are not going to become a famous soccer player. My friend still played soccer but he only played when he wanted to and he still was really good at soccer that I bet you he is better than me. One time my friend and I were in a good attitude right we were playing at the park and than my friend jumped off the slid and than he broke his arm is was so nasty His bone was popping out he was crying and yelling and Ididnt know what to do and i called his partents they came so fast and than they took him to the hospetil and I was sad because I felt like it was all my fault and than his partents cheered me up and they said its not yout fault its okay its just a common mistake and a few weeks later his arm got better his arm was in a case so he was good and I was the first one that sighned it so i was happy about that and than we were both happy we got ice cream and we had a sleepover and the rest of the day was good.",4,5,6,6,5,5,1489,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
548,1628,EA40087521CC,"Failure is a dreaded thing in our daily life what we try to avoid. A lot of people trying to not get in any situation where they can fail, and just a lesser layer of the people want to face with them. Those people find it as a learning process and they a make great outcomes from they life. Fear controlls every aspect of our life. How do we looks like? Did we made the right decission? In most cases we fear about failure because we are not sure about the success or a positive outcome of the situation and the consequences of our actions. This idea divide peoples minds to two sides, two ideology: shy, safety player and brave, risk taker. Both sides have pros and cons. Those who chose the safety game, are using they background knowledge what they learned for long years and made it highly sure to not fail it. The word shy is not the best representation for them just in that case when something new and unknown came in to learn. They dont take the risk to fail it and they obviously will not fail because they will not even try. That can be any situation like answer the question in class; try out a sport; go to the gym; wear a new cloth; ect. The only thing what is make a gate between them and to try it is the fear. They dont take the risk and they will never know the outcome. If its a fail then they take it as a lose. Maybe the only thing what is a benefit in their thinking they will really not going to lose anything but then the successes will come lesser. Also that doesnt mean they are not risk takers or they live in constant fear, its just more safer. The cases where they are need to take steps can be not that scarry or its doesnt need to be a big deal. These type of people are already made mistakes and the reason why then fear to try it again the previous experiences. Said something dumb in class and everyone laughted; tried a sport be he/she was not succes at all; in the gym he/she felt unconfortable because he/she was not that strong like the people around them, ect. On the other side those people who trying out new thigs and got experience are usually the ones who make something in their lives what will stand for them after time. Great example for this is the former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill itself. His life shows the importance of trying. If we just think about how he becamed a Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, its easy to realize it was not always easy for him. Biography of his life tells us how many times he tried and failed but even through he gained success. People like Churchill are thinkers and they take the failures as a lessons of the life. For them is a learning process of making an idea perfect; make an action successful; decide a the right way; answer a question rightfully. If a fail cames up after a wrong move they face with it and they are most importantly proud of it. Not proud about what they failed, about the correction, the knowledge what they gained and driving them to avoid the same and similar fails. Yes they can make the same mistake again but at the end they will be the winners. And this is the point where the enthusiasm came in. People are trying to reach their goals and enthusiasm drives them. Winston Churchill won the World War II because his goal was to not fail his people, the mankind, and everything what he built. Enthusiasm can have different faces like duty as a president, joy like an istrument player, or to bring happyness like a parent. To keep the enthusiasm is depending on the person. The goal what is requires it can be lesser, greater, midling, makes no difference. The person who keeping it is matters, not the size of the goal because anyone can be a president if he/she really wants it but cannot go to the gym a few times a week if he/she is lazy and dont have enough willingness in their heart. That is a close connection with our life goals. Doesnt matters if its short or long tearm goals. That enthusiasm can broke after fails or can be even stronger than before. My example is with the martial art also an example for this. I learned how to dual wield the nunchaku and the learning process was painfull. Im right handed and to learn, just to spin it, with my left hand hurted me. I was hitting my forearm thousand times. My skin was red after an hour of practice. People asked me why do I still trying and why do I dont stay down. The reason why I didnt stoped was my enthusiasm in my goal to master the nunchaku. After months of practice I did it successfully and in these days Im not a master yet but at least I cannot hit myself. A lot of people who going to failure to failure are also taking a risk to fail to the point where they cant try it again. That means a fail where a people can die. These are specific cases but not just death can stop us. Also there are situations where a person just become unable to do thing what he/she did before. And yes there also situations after tragedies where we can stand up stronger than before. There was a boy who loved to ride his bicycle and do tricks with it. One day he had an accident with it in a car crash and he lost his leg. He was in wheelchair for months but doctors offered him a chance to make him a plastic leg. He spent a lot of time in recovery and when he was able to move by himself he wanted to return to his dream. For a lot of time he failed to do anything with his bike. He was angry and broken. But he didnt gave up. After failing again and again he finally on his bike again. In these day he riding like before the accident because he never give up. His strory is inspire me. I agree with Winston Churchill. We need to fail to learn and enyoj what we reach. We need to try and train not till we can get it right, till we cant get it wrong. And we need a goal to be enthusiastic and to never lose it, to make it stronger after every fail. We can stay in our comfort zones and try to avoid the fails or we can face with them and get experience.

549,2159,A53DEC5A2DE8,"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone. Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it. The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity its more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you dont know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do. Another reason, why working with someones else its better. Sometimes student dont like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students dont really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and dont let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher. Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because its fun. Working in a group its more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. Its always nice meeting new people and getting to know them. And if they are from different country or different culture.

Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school.

The homework club would have to start at the end of the day when everyone has their homework,the club can be from 3:00pm to 5:00pm that way students have 2 hours to get their work done and have time to chill out at home. I am sure that many other people agree that we should have a homework club. We all know this would be a great opportunity for students that have a difficult time understanding their work. Homework clubs can also help students improve grades which will then lead to higher test scores all because students will get extra help and have someone who will help them understand their work better. I am sure that starting a homework club will lead students in a great path to success and wealth.",7,7,7,7,7,7,2411,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
554,28,64A8183557F7,"Should students graduate in three years? Some school offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years. Students should graduate in three years because, they have more time planing what they want to do, they have more time to work and save money for college and they have more time to spend time with their family. To have ideas who they can do during that year. Students should graduate from High school in three years because, some students dont know what career they want or they dont know if work or continue studying. In that year they can think and choose what they want. One of my friends graduated the last year of school and she stay at home because she doesnt know what career choose, so she just stay at home because she doesnt know what to study and cant find a job yet. Some students after four years in High School, they take one year more to think and relax at home. That is why i think is a good idea just three years of High School. They can take that year to work and save money for college, if they want to. They can just start work to adapt to their new life or new thing that are going to learn. In a fact, student can graduate in three years of High School because is better for them. I think is better because it help those student that are more than eighteen to graduate not too old. Some people think that students should not graduate from High school in three years because, they have less time, but they are wrong because, students can take the most important classes or they can take classes in the evenings. Some students take courses during the summers. Some students want to graduate early because have some goals that they want to complete. In the future there can be online classes for those who need extra classes. In conclusion, graduate from High school in three years is a good idea because, students can start college or the work force one year early. Students have more time to search a good college and to prepare their thing. This is good for parents too because, they can go to the college that their son or daughter wants to go.

555,2299,FA55AEEF8F9C,"Alot of people use cell phones In classrooms which I think Its a good Idea. Cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. In my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find Information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about 10 to 15 minutes. Another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. They wont have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers. Now lets talk about having a cell phone In classrooms In case of an emergnecy. One reason I believed they should allowed cellphones In classrooms because In case of a lockdown. If a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call 911 and give details of the suspect. In addition to my other reason, Students should be allowed to have their cellphone In case of an emergency call. what If something happens at home. For example, A students sibbling gets sick and doesnt stop crying until he sees one of his family. So the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents cant do anything because they cant leave work or theyll get fired. The parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling. In conclusion, I see no reason why students shouldnt be allowed to use cellphones In classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. It can save someones life. so I think students should be allowed to have cellphones In classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.

556,553,E0EBA1995BCB,"First impressions works as a normal form to react to a person, the impressions will depend how scary or funny it is, and how people feel in that moment. Impressions are almost impossible to change, they come instantly, people can not have control of it because first impressions come naturally from the human, the maind sends the first impressions when people are impressed, and people are not prepared to the first impressions. It is impossible to change. First reason, impressions come naturally from people, they can not have control of it. For example, when people meet with other people, they automatically have impressions of the new people that they are meeting, do not matter what type of people they are, but the impressions naturally come. Second example, people usually move around the country to live or visit, every new place that they are arriving, the impressions come by itself. Third example, during the school year, the students are exploring more about the classes, they even have been not thinking about it, but they already have impressions what the classes talk about, and the students did not can change those first impressions about the classes. Second reason, the maind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind sends the first impressions to you. For example, when people go to shopping to a marked, they are looking and comparing the prices from other marked. People are having impressions about the prices and their minds are working sending them impressions and also information from the other markeds prices. Second example, people who work on hospital, they are constantly seeing people with cancer, their minds are prepared to make impressions and send them without any difficulty. The type of impression depends how their minds are prepared to react on that situation. Third example, people who come to the U.S from other country normally they are having new impressions, their minds are having a big change. The mind is who make the biggest work to give the first impressions and adapt to the new type of live. Third reason, people are not prepared to the first impressions that they have during they are discovering new things, it come by itself. For example, when people go to the cinema to see the new movie about the world, they do not have any idea about what is waiting for them, they just infer that the movie is about the world, but stating the movie they start to have impressions. the impressions come without notice them. Second example,when people got 18 years old, they are not prepared to do everything by himself, they start to have impressions on how hard if the life outside with more responsibilities and without their parents. Impressions always surprise people because they never prepare for it. Third example, people who are starting new job, they are learning how to do it. They are having impressions how the job is, they were not prepared for those impressions that they are having during they are learning the new job. In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change, because first impressions are naturally from the people, it come instantly as result of a new thing that people learn. And mind has an important work on the first impressions, the mind is who send the first impressions to the person. Also, people are not prepared to the first impressions, it come as a surprise.

557,2817,F6EAE029B20B,"Today world, everything start to moving forward. People start to invent the new ideas and those ideas make life more easily. In medical world, people make a new kind of medicine to cure the disease, compare to the old world a lot of people had die. In technology world, people put those ideas into the physical objects that it is so important for today life. From all we see everything is start from the ideas and who invent the idea? This is the kind of the question that no one ever ask. It is us the people that invent the idea. People can make a change to the world if they start to think or we can call the attitude. The attitude of the people have a big impact to the surrounding. But not all the attitude have a good impact to the world it also have a bad impact. This is led to one of the controversial question from the science; that said do you agree or disagree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. From my perception I agree that the positive attitude is the key to success in life because it make a people have a good communication in the community between people and people, make us being more productive on everything we do, developed our self and also things surround us quickly. Everyday people need to make a connection to one another. And exchange the information from that connection. But the important thing is the way we thinking. Like in the school, there are a lot of student from different place and family. But some student is isolate and other is sociable. Most people think that the isolate student mostly are bad and the sociable student mostly are good. The reason that the student being isolated because there is something in the school that student can not accept so they become isolated. It kind like when you move from place to place you try to fit yourself in. It take time for them to being sociable like other student. This is not the reason for us to think that the isolate student have a negative attitude. And also not all the sociable student have a positive attitude. We can learn from the past that thing happen in high school led the student to commit suicide. The student that have a negative attitude like to bullying other student and left them no choice. For the student that commit suicide also have a negative attitude because they take the outside source seriously then them self. This is the small example that we can compare for what the meaning of the word attitude is. People like to say that most millionaire are a bad person. We can not believe in this conventional wisdom. People sometime said the bad thing to other to make them self look good. But from what I see most millionaire have a good attitude because it led them to being more productive. Productive person is the person that you should be friend with. They always share the good things in their mind to you. Not just in the business world that have a productive person. Also in the community that we live in everyday. People we meet everyday that like to talk about the good things that happening to them. They share the idea how to get there and how to do it. It not means that they try to show off to you. Dont thing them wrong. We can see when the people get their new job, they like to share the idea . You just need to open your heart and listen to them. It might one day you can use this idea to do other things too. Also in the political world, a lot of Prime minister, President, try to keep them self productive by doing a charity to the poor people. This is why the world become smaller and smaller. There are a lot of country in the world with a different culture, tradition and religion. And a lot of people know at least one language that is not their mother tough language. But also a lot of people that only know how to speak their mother tough language. When we were young, we spending time mostly in school and they teaching us the art, history, science, literature but the important thing is the language. We learn just one language and spending almost the ten years for us to able to speak. For those years, we learn the basic how to speak in a formal way. Also our parent watch our behavior and manner along the way. When we reach to the puberty, mostly everything is start to change. The important thing is the way we thinking. Everything that we been learning from our parent, teacher, friend, society start to root inside our brain and also define who we are. One famous quote from smart human that we call him Buddha said "" You are what you think you are"". This quote not designed just for his religion but for the worldwide. If you think you can become success, you will be success one day. If you think you want to be a doctor, you will become a doctor one day. No matter what you say always say a good things to the people around you. No matter what you do always do a good things to the people around you. If you want the people to do or say a good things to you too. And everything is start from us the way we thinking. Positive attitude is an important key for all success in life. And for my experience whenever I feeling down, discouragement, disappointment, anxiety, hopeless I always repeat this quote to myself ""You are what you think you are"". So after that if I had a bad time I keep thinking to myself that I can get through it. Even you have a small chance to success just keep thinking to yourself that you can make it through. One student asked the teacher will I pass the test if I do not know anything and the teacher answer even if you know that you can not make it just go to the test center. When they hand out the test just do what you know. And after that you will know that you have at least 1 percent chance of passing the test.

558,1365,D457F3AEAC6D,"I do agree with Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchhill without failure how can we humans excied in life to get to success? To prove my statement i will provide two reasons, and also two examples, explaining why i believe that failure can lead humans to a world we couldnt imagine it could exiest. Reason number one would be Battles and Wars. I believe that losing Battles and Wars help us the united states of america create new weapons wither it was nuclear or bullets. Another reason why i say that is because without losing those battles and wars how wouldve we found out about atomic bombs or harden steel bullets. It sounds crazy and highly dishorroable to are fallen heros who were killed in action, but if we won wars and battles everytime we would soon fall. Because we keep using the same positions and plans in order to win, and we also would feel too confident in wining so we will be using the same weapons over and over again and let the other team discover those new atomic weapons. Reason number two is about automobles. Automobles have been around for a very long time now i guess if my calculations are right its been almost 1,500 years since Henrey Ford showed the world his first ever automoble, the Model T. Henrey Ford had to go through so many people doubting his Model T project would work. Day by day, month by month, even year after years of failed experments. But in the spring of 1830 he successfully got one fully working and running. He had to go through so much walls blocking his path in order to show the world that a automoble was and still is possible. Another example would be Tesla. The famous electronic car company to power there cars with electricity. those guys mustve gone through so many experments that i cant even imagine and the amout of failed ones too and im pretty sure there is alot more failed test projects than passed ones. I say that to be reasonable about it not saying it to make fun of them because if they didnt fail the first time the first modles would have been super crappy, like the cars would suck. Because after every failed project you get new ideas and new imagines of how you want the car to repersent the company and have a good repuation. So if failure wasnt an option for these two companys the cars of 2020 wouldve sucked so much because the company will only car about the money and just send running crappy looking cars that we humans have as a need for work and family. Those are my last two thoughts about failure and Wisten Churchill isnt wrong at all. Without failure succces would feel like nothing like if it was pointless. And we wouldnt live the world we live in today if it wasnt for people back then who didnt stop failing until they reached succesed.",6,6,7,6,6,7,2961,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

560,190,71A9098715EB,"Self-reliance is better then hoping someone makes the best decisions for you. This is because people need to follow there own instincts in life no one knows them like they do and what is best for them. Why would anyone want someone to make decisions for them, People will always want what is best for them so if people trust someone to pick a important life decision what if they pick something that will help them in there long run and not you. My older brother 5 years ago was done with school and was planning his career he wanted to be a engineer but my mom and dad wanted him to be doctor; He made his own decision at the end and now lives his best life with a kid and wife. If he had chose to be a doctor he would be in school still and never meet his wife. This shows how important it is to trust your self even if no one agrees with you.

561,2044,5C72AB0B1232,"Whats a career? a career is an occupation or a profession that someone do. People can start their career at any time in life. Its a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because career would prepare students for what they want to become in the future, and it can help students learn more skills and experience when they work with others. Firstly, career can prepare students for what they want to become in the future. Consider someone who wants to become a doctor. People who want to become doctors usually work at the hospital so they can watch how doctors do their work. For example, Generic_Name was a student at Generic_school and he wanted to become a doctor one day. Generic_Name started to work at the hospital after his parents told him that they didnt have money to put him in college. Generic_Name learned a lot of of things about doctors before he went to college; and when he went to college, it wasnt so hard for him because most things about doctors seemed familiar. Generic_Name graduated with a bachelors degree and he became a good doctor. This proves that committing to a career at a young age can be helpful in the future. Secondly, Career can help students learn more skills and have more experience of things in life. for example, Generic_Name loves when someone plays guitar and he always say that he wish he knew how to play guitar. Generic_Name was hired after he applied on a part time job which was called "" Teen fun time"". it was a good job for Generic_Name because they could teach him many different things including guitar. Generic_Name was taught how to play guitar by some guy who liked how Generic_Name was a hard worker and nice to everyone. After hard months of training, Generic_Name could play guitar by himself. people loved how Generic_Name played guitar, therefore, his manager made him play at the entrance of the building so people can enjoy while entering the building. Generic_Name was able to draw, paint, and cook after he worked at the Teen fun time for a while. Teen fun time made Generic_Name a good guitar player and a great cooker. Some people may say that it is not a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age because some teenagers turn into disrespectful children to their parents when they receive their first checks. For example, Generic_Name was hired at the boys and girls club. After he received his first check, he could not do anything his parents ask him to do and he would claim that hes going to be late to work. His parents did not like it and it made them unhappy sometimes. However, committing to a career at a young age is good because it teaches teenagers a lot of stuffs they need to know in life. Teenagers also make money from a career, which means that they can help their parents with small needs like buying clothes for themselves and shoes. In conclusion, a career at a young age prepares students for their future career. If someone want to become a pilot, they have to work at the airport so they can get some ideas on how planes fly. Committing to a career at a young age can help students learn more skills and have more experience on things in life. By working with people, students can learn new stuffs from people they dont know. This proves that committing to a career at young age is good for students.",7,7,7,7,7,7,1194,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Doing something productive keep your body and mind working, and as we know exercise help us to avoid many kinds of diseases, and perhaps raising our lifetime. Its like my grandfather told me someday in the past..."" if I stop to work, Ill die,because, work help me to forget all my bad situations in my life even my diseases, and instead of that I always thinking... what would be my next task to accomplish ?"".

563,1939,22F16C83DE10,"Students Summer Break Ideas Most of students like to enjoy their summer vacation,but some educators feel like summer vacation is too long. Students and Adults decided to come up with different set of ideas to make summer break not long.. Some of the students are fine with having 2 or 3 months of summer break,and some people argue that there should be a year-round schools. A year- round school is were there would be 3- 4 week break in summer, a longer winter break,and a week off in spring and fall. These were the overall ideas that both students an Adults choose. My personal opinion is that i would go with the year- round school because it would only take a year that students would go to school and have a shorter summer and a longer winter break. The reason why i choose this was because i prefer having a longer winter break. why? you may ask , having a longer winter break wil make students not lose a lot of school because in most part of the United States snows a lot. About 75% of parents have called in school saying that their children is sick and will not be able to go. These type of excuses can cause students lower their education and making up the work of days they haved missed. Instead of the founder of school saying their would be an ""2 hour delay"" or ""schools are close"" . Students can just stay home while having their winter break and not worrying about if they are going to school or not. Having a shorter summer break can help bring students come back to school with a positive energy and a fresh start. Since summer break wont be long studens wont forget what they haved learned. Students are likely to fail if they would have have a really long break this is the reason why students forget what teachers haved taught them. Teenagers are likely to be more tired during the winter instead of summer this is why students are mostly tardy or absent. Even though i prefer having a shorter summer break, i still rely of the students that choose to have a longer break because it is fun to be able to go out when the weather is warm but at the same time i feel like is better having a longer break in the winter because is safer staying home when it gets really cold and when it snows. Schools that are in the middle recontructing have to allow students take their classes out in the trailers. Even though public schools dont close when it snows a little they still have to reconsider. Some schools are constucting and students have to walk to one trailer to another to get to their class this why i like the idea of having a week off during fall and also when its spring break ,It gets a bit cold and in some areas it already starts to snow. Having fall and spring break can bring students get their week off and take some time off before they have their SOL. It can also help refersh their brain and can start studying to be able to pass their upcoming tests. My final conclusion is that the year-round schools sound like a good idea. It can really help students manage a lot with their education and also responsibilities. It can also help teachers not being stressed because they can also take their days off. School wont be that stressing if it were to take this idea. All of these were my own personal opinions. ",7,6,5,6,7,6,464,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
564,1594,A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them. However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone arent truely who they are. The person can be good looking person youve ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them. Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you. Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you. Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are. ",8,7,7,8,7,8,2150,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

We use projectors for class if we need to see something. We use technology for our safety like cameras. So without technology we could not do anything like call or text or shop online or learn. Are lives have changed a lot when technology was invented.

566,2655,C045A27AFE82,I agree to this beacase students like us always have to got to shcool evreyday of the week and somtimes students get stressed out beacause evreyday we have to got to shcool so it should be better if they extend the shcool time to shorter time or half way. In my opinion it hink that 3:15 is to much of our day so i think that we should make the shcool time shorter. I think it will be the best thing for evreybody because somtimes people have to do thing at home . Sometime si just to late to do them beacasue at 3:15 is already getting dark so i think it shuld be best for all of us if we should get out half time. It will better evreyone beacause evreyone will have time to doanytging that they have to do at home. The last thing i see is that other shcools get to get out more early that us and what i think is that is mot fair they come out early and we dont. But somtime we should have more time out of shcool because when i go home i have things to do.,5,5,5,5,5,4,2594,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
567,1606,869B37DA1D3E,"Dear: Generic_Name I Understand that you are concidering the idea to work in group. I appreciate what are you trying to do and I agree with, for two reasons I think working in group can give you a lot of benefits because you can help each other, so you can do a better job and, also you can share differents ideas with your parners. The first reason is that you can do a better job working in group. For example when I am working in group in my job I ask my parners to check my work to make sure I am doing a good job. additianally, you can share different ideas with your parners or also, you can share your toys that you usually use for work. For example when I am working in group with my class I always ask my friends if I can use their stuf. Therefore I strongly believe that working in group give you a lot of benefits. which I allow with positive for two reasons. you can do a better job helping each other and, also you can share your ideas with your parners. thank for your time. sencerly: Generic_Name",7,5,5,6,7,5,1778,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
568,1690,331103D7D5CF,"""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing, "" said by the philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer. Giving a good example by your own experience might influence other people; it depends on the situation. In my opinion, giving a good example is not the only thing to influence people as said in the quote, but there are things other than setting a good examples that influence people. For example, if someone had experience in playing basketball, and another guy was a beginner, it will be helpful if the experienced one helps him and shows him how to play by training him, but if the experienced one tells the begginner person an example of how to shoot the ball but not by showing him, it wouldnt be helpful to him and wont influence him. One of the reasons i think that example might not be helpful is because when time moves on, the way that things work changes. Some people when they set a good example to influence someone that need motivation, they set an example from their own experience that might be some years ago, That can create a problem. For example, if a computer science major who graduated 10 years ago, and another one who just started college to study computer science and have some obstacles, if the major gave examples to the other guy about what he did in college 10 years ago to influence him, it would be a problem because as time goes we humans move forward in technology and we develop the education, so if the major gave the other guy his own experience it would be different than college now. This example wont help the guy who just started college, but it would be better if the major showed him the way to study and try to explain to him things. Sometimes people understand examples wrongly and influence others in an incorrect way, and it can be a big problem, It can turn motivation into failure. For example, there was a famous quote saying that failing many times without loss of enthusiasm leads to success, if someone study medicine in college and then he found himself failing tests and projects, but he took this quote as his influencer and he didnt lose enthusiasm, maybe after a while when he find himself still getting the same grades, he will lose enthusiasm and he will give up. The problem here is that he misunderstood the quote, the quote meant that he shouldnt loss enthusiasm even if he fail many times, but he thought that after failing two or three times he will do more better. Some people may argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the only and best way to influence other people, because they think that if people follow the examples of the experienced people, they will succeed and will be motivated to do more work. For example, if someone successful gave an example of how he became successful, and what obstacles did stop him, and how did he get through them, Maybe some teenager listen to him and become influenced, and then he work hard to become like the successful guy. Or maybe someone who failed in something listen to the successful guy and learn how did he get through the things that stopped him, and then he become motivated to be successful and he work hard to reach his goal. In conclusion, influencing others by your own experience might be helpful to some people, but also it can become a problem and not helpful to alot of people. Furthermor, using examples from your own behavior is not the only way to influence others, thats why i disagree with the quote, because examples could be perfect, but it is not the best or the only way. There are other ways as i mentioned, that could turn peoples lifes from failure to success.",7,6,7,7,6,7,659,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

In this paper i will argue that if students should take class that that will guide them towards a specific career. should student consider their career pass at a young age,yes because when the student gets older and becomes a adult he or she wont have to have a boring and low paying job. Im am in the eleventh grade and I already know that i want to be when in older, I want to be a U.S.M solder. The class that am taking right now in high school that will help me become what I want to be when am older is JROTC. You may ask that is JROTC? JROTC is a class that teaches student about the United State Armed Forces. Another class that am taking in my school that will help me with my fucher career is Econ and Finals. Econ and Finals is a class that is a high school requirement to graduate, but i like that class because i know that its going to help me with my fucher career. What if we dont start preparing are self for are fucher careers after high school well be loss, confused,and broke too. In my family i dont think anyone do what they wanted to do i high school . I remember my mom telling me that she wanted to become a Aries but she never became a Aries because in her old school they didt have art and she dropped out to have family. Working is something everyone have to do.

571,232,F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frogs interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it didnt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we humans do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasnt a lot of organs in there And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frogs stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didnt made me want to stop either. After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frogs eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frogs eye wasnt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it didnt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself . After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun . Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasnt as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didnt see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project . And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And thats why i think they are the best .

572,1569,F9C298BF7CE5,"I agree with this prompt that positive attitude is the key to success because, with positive attitude it gets a person where they want to be in life. However with negative attitude you will never get anywhere at all, it will make a person lose confident, also would make you give up right there on the spot which means you gave up your a quitter. Then soon turn into a really bad habit that cant be stopped. Attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect. How can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible thats motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. By doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy. This is why its important just by your attitude can have a huge impact on your success and how you use it is very important. By motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. Its like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. This plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. An example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. I know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that. spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. By boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games theres very little time to accomplish your success before its over and soon to be regretted. Also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. But Mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. When something doesnt go as planned, keep trying bring that positive attitude forward never give up its not too late to change. Taking a test and having it being extremely hard when given negative attuide you will fail and face the consequences but doing the opposite you would be much more relaxed,and will boost that confident up into keep trying because life is full of mistakes you have to push and keep trying now thats what being successful is almost about. Albert enstin did he give up? No right? and look at where hes at he became one of the most successful person ever same with Bill Gates and Mark Zurkrbuirg when you keep going you will see the results so keep pushing and one day I guarantee you will be a great role model or even better. Just remember always keep that positive attuide and keep trying think about the good and not bad and you will have the key to success. learning from your mistakes is another key attuide to have, people have to understand that when you learn its OK to fail and get back up from it thats why you learn from them for a reason. Having positive attitude in life helps you grow as person to understand, and in the long run it will important. When doing so, you will just keep growing,and having good support from yourself or others. think about businesses to be in a business its all about that positive attuide and character thats what makes you learn from your mistakes and to keep growing. In a business theres a lot of ups and downs with negative attuide it will only make it worst but when your in the right state of mind there are choices to make that you might not like but it is part of life,in a business you need to support one another. In conclusion having a positive attitude is the key success in life, without it how will you know what youve accomplished along the way. There are many ways to have a key to success but the most important one is having positive attitude. And this will benefit your life even more,attitude is energy and showing off the wrong kind of energy will be consequences and will not get anyone anywhere in life. This is very important for each an other its not very hard to be positive you just have to be in the right state of mind. This shows how much attitude can really change things it shows how important this is. I believe positive attuide is the key to success because it motivates a person to do good or better, spreads positvity to others who really need it,and makes you learn from your mistake because no one is perfect.

If they like arts classes they are free to take that class . but students that dont like art class do not have to take the class . For example i really dont like arts classes but ill still take the class because at my school they do this thing that if we need to retake a curse class then we well have 25% of taking that class or if we dont need a curse class we had the 50% of taking that . It might be the same in some schools or it might be different it others schools. some kids may not like the idea of taking art classes and some may like the idea . Kds may want to have space to take the class they want and they cant because they are required to take arts class . Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boys would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that its boring for them to be in that class . I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they dont like the class or something like this . Thats why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take . I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class . its really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that dont like drama and they dont let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be . thats another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids .

With the opportunity of learn in different courses in high school , will be more easy for the students to decide what specific career they like more and they want to learn and study after high school In other hand , the specific courses in high school , would be selected by the students , because if they decide to take a course that they like , they will enjoy at the same time , and they will try to do the better they can , and this is a good manner in that the students can get good grades .",6,6,7,4,4,6,3611,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Sometimes students are more focused on who finishes first and sometimes think its a race. students would also have the chance of working on their own time when they can,like that students could proprobly finish their work faster.

576,2705,AA416CED237D,"I think some people might find visiting a national park enjoyable because it features better activities and it also attracts more people around the World for example the Grand Canyon or hiking mountains attracts lots of older people from all over the world every single year. But others might like Community parks because theres not that many people like national parks, kids might find community parks more enjoyable because it provides a wide variety of things like Playgrounds, Soccer fields, Basketball courts, etc and its also free unlike national parks were you have to pay in order to get in. I think an enjoyable way to spend time outdoors is by playing a sport like soccer, basketball etc, in a community park because you can can play there any time with friends and family its also free, you can also meet new people in a park or you can also join a sports team like a soccer team and play it with your friends which can also lead to scholarships but in order to get that you must train and work hard then you might get in to teams bigger soccer teams and you might become a Professional player and join big teams like Barcelona, Real Madrid, PSG or other soccer teams, thats what I like to do outdoors and I think other people should stop playing video games, social media, etc and try something new outdoors because it can change your future and life for ever and playing a sport can also help you meet new people travel places, meet soccer stars from all around the world like Spain, France, United Kingdom. Sports are also good for your health running helps your heart, I also like watching soccer games I support Barcelona a team from Spain the reason why I support that team is because they have really good soccer player like Messi, Luis Suarez and Couthino and they also win trophies like the UEFA Champions League were all the European teams play every year to win the Championship. also every 4 years theres the World Cup were every Nations soccer team plays to win the World cup. In soccer if you are good at the sport and join a professional soccer team you can get paid up to more then one million!

It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasnt good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them. My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots; when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft. Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer.

The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasnt good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build.

I use thought that wasnt at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. This show that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. She always practical how to read in English and write English. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned. Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish.

579,2152,58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and wont even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either. My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think its really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and its shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them. I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that wont do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do whats best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it. Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and thats another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea. Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their lifes for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",7,7,7,8,8,7,1144,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
580,554,FAA9FC1B315B,In my personal opinion when some schools offer distance learning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing I mostly disagree. Its not because I am attending a public high school. There are reasons why I mostly disagree about this situation. One of the reasons why I disagree is because this might hurt the students communication skills. when you have classes online you are not at the school you are home taking this class so you basically dont associate with anyone except your teacher now since i have never took a online class i wouldnt be able to tell if its better to not know no one or to associate with anyone but personally I just dontt thing its good for students to attend online school if you are someone that like to work with people and not just your teacher. Other students also might be able to understand some stuff that you dont understand and that they should be able to help you. They wont be able to help you if you not there with them. The second reason why I disagree and I really dont think that online schools is not beneficial is that it hurts your participation skills too. Here in school we do so much activities connected to things we are learning and it helps very much because if you do activities connected to the things we are learning it gets stuck in your mind. Its also better to ask questions and to understand better. There might be some stuff that you didnt understand face to face with your teacher its better to ask them like that and understand like that instead of emailing them or contacting them through different thing. Also the teacher might not respond as soon as possible and that might be a problem and affect your grade and thats why its better to talk to your teacher face to face and deal with understanding face to face thats my second opinion. My last and final reason is that you might get lazy and miss classes since you take it at your home . That might affect your grade too which is very risky if youre not a productive and committed person to your education online class is not for you. For example me personally it will not be good for me because I am a very lazy person i am pretty sure I will miss classes either by sleeping in or some other unexeptalbe reasons . But also there are people that are very organized and careful people out here that can risk this for those kind of people online classes are good and they can take it because thy are committed to Finnish there education in a very careful way. Those are my good reason why i dont agree with online classes its a good thing that schools offer distance learning as an option for students if you have a good reason why you dont actually go to the school but personally i dont agree with this situation. ,8,6,7,8,7,6,3790,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
581,432,68256AC96C72,"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age. Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since theyre still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldnt have to worry about what career they want since theyre still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life. In conclusion, i think students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future. Students can also work in a long-term commitment in a particular profession.

584,187,9702AD260172,"In this essay I will talk about how courses and daily life in high school influence the students to guide them and to think in a specific career. When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age. The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support. The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society. Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild. Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. Thats why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone. In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported. The most important area is focus in their future as the best, doing big differences and doing a legacy.

585,1160,E89C57CE37A6,"For some people that is not a good idea to finish the High School in three year, because in another part is not agreeable and unjust for some student who study for four year to see something new, so this is disagree because the students need to study four year in High School. Finish the high school in three year is a big bad idea because is to short to finish the high school, and another parts some students dont wants to go more to the school so they choose that new program for a short year to graduate in high school. The other parts is not for all High schools to finish in three year, so is most better to delete that program and cancel about to finish the high school in three year and the students who follow that program they need to take the normal high school. To change the new program for all high school of the country is not easy, because some schools dont agree to doing that so is most better to continue the traditional four years. If they change that program for all schools of the country they have a big responsibility about that, because most of High Schools they have a big problem and work for example to change like that credit for graduate to the high school, the SOL text so is not a very good idea to doing that. The conclusion, this is the best option, is to follow the rules of the schools. One should not make a big problem with the laws and the constitution of the schools.

586,1621,E566F0D20F98,"I dont think it would benefit students to attend classes from home by online such as video conference Why? because they would get distracted by anything else at home and also they wouldnt have the chance to experience what it would be like in school. If they attend school from home how would they get things done at home? they have the chance to do something else other then school work because they are going on their time. They also are not supervised with teacher like they would at school. They could easily get answers when it comes to tests and quizzes so where would the challenge be when you could just do that. When you are at school you are supervised so there is no looking up answer,you actually have to study to accomplish things. You could easily get distracted by things at home even say I dont want to do it anymore and I feel like thats the risk it would take if students are allowed to take classes at home online. Students also would miss the chance to experience what it would be like in school. The chance to meet new people, make friends,and just simple socialize with other peers. It would also help students for the real world because when you work you cant do it from home on a computer. You actually have to show up to work and work with others. You also miss the chance to do other things that you would in school that you cant at home like join a club or play a sport and actually do so much that you cant at home. Have that motivation to wake up and go to school and challenge your self and prepare yourself for the world. When you are at home,wouldnt you get board being home all day instead of being at school and just enjoying it. Yes its a struggle waking up early in the morning to go to school but also its boring staying home and missing all the things you can do and learn at school with friends and teachers. I understand why some students would consider taking classes from home maybe they have a personally reason or they cant keep up and rather take their time at home but for that reason you would have to do your best and not get distracted. Being home may help them do better then at school I understand but I think you miss a lot and all the experience that you could get at school. I personally dont think it would benefit missing all that and knowing how it would be. When you get a job that you dont have the option to do it home in the computer so how would you learn and know what its like. Therefor I dont think students would benefit from attending classes at home by online or video conferencing. Student should attend school and experience it all not be home distracted and miss many chances to learn new things and socialize with peers.

587,880,BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldnt want to graduate a year early right? but in the end its not even worth it. I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesnt make you more than them, it doesnt make any student seem smart, its just them taking the short cut to end school. I believe it isnt a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resumes, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished. Another reason why I dont think its a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students whod want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, dont do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isnt a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesnt make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isnt the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that dont even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job thatll pay you well and something that you know youll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months. For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who dont plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just dont take the school serious but only if they knew that, thats the key for them to open to get to their future. If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, Id think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that theyd want to get a head start with their career. Thats good Im not saying its bad, its just something I wouldnt do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity. In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life.

One Reason why this would not be a good idea is because sometimes teenagers are careless something may go wrong with your life or you just wanna do something new. all those classes that I selected from freshman year are not gonna be worth it because you gonna have to take new classes. for example my friend selected a technology class in freshman year, and he search it up how much they make in a year and that was not what he expected. so he change to materials and process to learn how to cut, and built houses.

591,52,56053054CB1F,"I believe that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it, The disicions you make can play a big role in how you turn out to be. For example the people you hang with, How you grew up and the type of household you were in, And my last example is is your motivation because being motivated can help you build good character traits for the future. The type of people you hang with play a big role in your character because you can pick up a lot of good and bad things from different people. They can influence you to do a lot and you know what they say ""you are who you hang with"" for example if you hang with people who do nothing but good you are going to want to do nothing but good but if you hang around people who are lazy and sit at home doing nothing with there day you are also going to become lazy and not motivated to do anything. The way you grew up and the type of household you were in also plays a big factor in your character because thats what you are around, Thats the energy with you all the time for example if your paerents are having problems at home all the time and you can become depressed and feel down all the time, Since thats the energy thats in the house, Which can make you start struggling in school since you would be down all the time. But on the other side if your household is very good, everyones happy and the vibe is good it can make you a very happy and positive person since thats all the energy youre getting, nothing but positive vibes and it can help you with school. Your motivation in my opinion is the most important part of building good character traits because its so good to be motivated and having a something to work for, If you have that the past does not matter and you can be the most awsome person that you can possibly be for example if you are really motivated you can become anything you want. Your past and all the things you overcame can motivate you another example is if you and your family is really struggling that is going to want you to push harder, And in that procces it would build a lot of good character traits that will be with you forever. In conclusion you make your character and choose the people you hang out with, The type of hpuse you are living in and the things that lead up to you being motivated and i dont think you can get influenced beyond your control because you can control everything you do for example if you dont like your friends switch things up, If you dont like how things are going at home go live with someone else. Everyone should always know that nobody can or should control you, Everyone makes choices bad or good you are the one who made that choice.

The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight. The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. I have a saying its ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself. My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self. In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight because its healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem.

Buying items that are needed in life is all about what you want and what your instincts tells you. Buying houses or what bank account you want is what you should decide. All that has to do about your lifes matters its your choices and instincts. Everyone wants the best for themselves and want to be self-reliance. Decisions that are decided for yourself and ideas you come upon on should always be followed. Your life matters is on your hands we do and know whats best for ourselves and the choices we make throughout our life is what we want, and not seeking to others to make the choices for your life. Overall people who value self-reliance know exactly what you want and know whats best for themselves. ",6,7,6,7,7,7,321,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
594,2832,DBDBF971510B,"It is often said that you can not make a child, teenager, or adult do what they do not want to do. Imagine starting a new school year; students are ready to learn, to take classes they will really enjoy, and to see their friends. It comes time to pick up their schedule and they see that there is some classes that they really would not like to take but those classes are required for them to take. A students starts stressing because there is no way they can change their schedule since those classes are required. I believe students should not be required to take a music class, art class, or drama class because it would not only affect them but it would also affect their grades and their future, students would skip the class; making their attendance bad, and students might show up to the class but they would not put in the effort they need in order to recieve the credit. In many cases, students who do not like the classes they are taking will not do the work in order to get a good grade. Having good grades is what makes your GPA great. We all know that having good grades and keeping a good GPA is very important when it comes to college and universities. Students will need to attend a college or a university in order to get a good paying job. By requiring students to take these classes, you are forcing them to learn something they do not need in the future or that will not fall in their career field. For example, a student might want to work at a fast food restuarant in the future but in high school this students was required to take a class that has nothing to do with it. How would taking a music class help this student achieve their goal of working at a fast food restuarant? Many people may argue that taking an art class should be required because it opens the mind on being creative but again what does an art class have to do with what a student wants to be in the future? Unless that students wants to be an artist of course. Secondly, if you force a student to take a class they do not want to take, they would just skip the class or just wont show up that whole school day. Having good attendance is also very important to have because if students do not have good attendance they get put on an attendance chart. An attendance chart is a chart where students have to sign in at the time they got to a class and sign out at the time they left that class. If a students keeps skipping the class they do not like, their grades get worse because they are not recieving the work they need to due to skipping class and their attendance keeps worsening which will only get them into bigger trouble. For instance, where I live if a student does not show up to school for more than fifteen days they get put into a juvenile detention center. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motive a student to come to school because they are really not learning anything important from those classes. Lastly, every high school student knows that they need a certain amount of credits in order to graduate. In order to recieve those credits a students grades, GPA, and attendance must be excellent. Requiring such classes that should be electives will not motivate a student to get good grades, good GPA, or good attendance. If anything making these classes required will only make these students less motivated into coming to school and earning those high school credits. In conclusion, forcing or requiring students to take these classes that should be electives would affect them mentally. It would affect them mentally because they might not be as good as the other people in that class. Students should not be required to take such classes like art, music, or drama; those classes should stay as electives. Helping every student learn new material, graduate, and get them into college should be our main focus instead of making them take classes they do not need to.

There not achieving their goals if the the world wants them to do something. People need to achieve their goals without someone telling what to do in their life. They have to know if they if the goals right for them to achieve, People with goals often dont like their goals because the world wants them to be something else in their lives. Often times people mistaken for want they want to be versus what they dont want to do. People who are not achieving their goals they go to be something else because they dont have a goal, or they are not themselves. People are trying to be something else in their life by being not themselves. People have tried being themselves but failed because they cant find themselves. The majority of people will be something else rather than then be who they are inside of them. The world is a big place to be in for people and they dont want to express themselves out in the world, so they try to be something else to fit in. The majority of people who are something else are not happy for their decision because they are trying to hide their real self. The majority of people are not being themselves in the world because they are not happy about themselves. People dont want to express on who they are in the real world and hide themselves. People are not showing who they are out in the world. Often times people dont like to see themselves because they havent found themselves.

596,566,9A25D43F4CEF,"I strongly agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson. because your never going to succeed as a person in the work force or something else. because these people wont step out of their comfort zone. because they are too lazy or scared. Ralph has a very good point : Lazy, shy, scared people wont succeed or grow as a person or in the work force. Doing more than what your good at helps grow your confidence, and your way of doing things for the better. Doing more could possibly give you a little higher pay raise or be a boss at a at a big company. Doing more than what your already good at can go a long way for you. You should start doing better right now because it will benefit you in so many ways. Not doing more than you can already do can possibly give you bad rep. Or some people will see you as a lazy person in life. Because that person is not pushing him or her self to do more or the beyond because that person isnt motivated to do anything more that their good at. That person wont succeed as much as the person that is doing more or the beyond. One time when i was a small Child. My Uncle always talked to me about a lot of stuff. The most important thing he told me is to do more than what i can already do. Because it will take me places and it will make my life a lot better. He said if you do more. I will succeed more in life. When i got older he talked to me more about it. Because he knew i was gonna do more in life. Now i work as hard and beyond than the other person. And make more money because i work more than i already mastered. I think working beyond than your comfort zone will help a lot. You can be really successful if you challenge yourself in life. It could be school or work. It doesnt hurt if you challenge your self. You will succeed as much than the other guy.

Well that is what i think about Seeking multiple opinion. Seeking multiple opinion can make someone trust in you. When someone trust in you, he or she can tell you their secret about everything they have in secret. If someone trust in you he or she will know that you are a good friend. For example, if you do something wrong to your friend who trust in you, She or her is going to forgive you when you say sorry because, he or she trust in you. Being nice and respectful for example, not saying bad word to someone to be depressed, saying please when you are asking someone for something can also make someone trust in you.

By following simple rule that are established for your safety, you wont lose your school staffs trust. Behave when you are in the halls. when the bell rings, and you are dismissed, go to your other class immediately. Dont take a walk around the school, go to the gym, or cause a traffic by standing in the halls and talking to your friends. Its not a safe nether is it responsible. Keep your hands to your self, unless if its an activity that allowed you to touch the other students or even staff members with adult supervision. Behave in the cafeteria. Once you are in line to get your food, you should respect others by waiting your turn. This isnt only respectful, but its even a good habit. Walk back to your seat, dont run. Running could cause for you to spill your food, and someone could slip and that resulting in an injury. When you finish your food, cleanup after your self if necessary. Behave when you are on the school bus. When you are on the bus its nice of you to greet your bus drive, but you dont have to. Quietly walk to an open seat and sit down. Sit with your grade level. Once settled, you could quietly talk to the person sitting next to you, dont yell across the bus. On the bus it is important for the bus driver to be able to see from the back window or door to prevent car accidents, dont put your stuff in the middle of walkway. If you are going to be eating on the bus, which you are not aloud, unless the bus driver said so, clean up any mess that you may have caused. Showing responsible and appropriate behaviors could make teachers more flexible with any other improper behavior that you may cause. For an example, you are a bad student, you were late to class, and you decided to run. The teacher catches you, and you get in trouble. Example two, you are a good student, you were late to class, the bell rings but you dont run, the teacher forgives you.

Its fun to do many activities outdoors and its also good for you to be outside moving around and doing things. Spending time outdoors are great for doing activities,and to see what other things you can do at parks. For one, playing catch is a good activity to enjoy with others, and to move around. People can find that playing catch is a good activity to enjoy outdoors, because most people play it differently and many of them can learn how to play, its also a good way to play fair with others, and to throw/catch a ball. Secondly, riding bikes is a great activity to do at a park with your family or friends. Therefore, riding bikes is an amazing activity for outdoors, you can enjoy riding along the streets, and to enjoy the outside nature by looking around the park and to hear the people playing around having fun outside. On the other hand, doing any other activities are good to enjoy outside. For example, playing football is a good game to spend time outside practicing or playing with friends, and tag is another game that kids love enjoying outside running around and laughing and playing fair with other childrens on the grass or even just chasing little things that they see, like a dog they like to go after a dog and pet it.

It just add all of extending time together and people already used to the old model. We should not change to the new model. Its good if we cut one school day off and just add two hours for each day because you will have three day off , thats sounds great , we can do a lot of things if we have one day off.

Usually 12th grad, they dont have any P.E class, they need to have some sports to make sure they are more health.

Its good for the teacher too, they are most tired people in the school, when they teaching, they can not sit there ,they need walk around and make sure you understand that the knowledge he just teach you. they need time for break too. so I suggest our school should change to this model, extending the school day two hours for four day.

Sometimes gas stations get rob and the police have to chase them down and sometimes you can help them.

I believe that the students should commit to career at a young age because. career can show how creative students can be, and have a had start to choose their careers before they get out of high school. First, I would like to talk about how creative students can be in their career. When school. For example, I would like to express myself through my art to show my emotions and I love to excess myself through my art. It makes me feel happy but if I dont start choosing my career at a young age then how am I going to know what I want for my career and the students wont know what they want for their career when they get out of high school and thats how I would like to express myself through my career. Also, about students having a head start to choose their career at a young age. for example, I would not know what to choose if I didnt start in high school it would be a waste of time for me to find a career if I didnt start at a young age, if I started at school then there wont be a problem for me to find one also I would rather start now then later on in my life and how Am I going to express myself if I dont have a career to start with thats why students should think a head of choose their career. Last, students should think about what they want to do or be when they grow up because schools can help with your career when you need it, they can put you in a class where you want to learn about the career that you choose and it will make is so much easier for the student to start now. for example, if I where to choose a career I would have to tell my teachers what classes that I what to take for my career chooses it can help a lot of students with their career chooses it would be a problem for them to tell the teachers what careers they want and it would be more easier for them to start telling the teachers what career they want and put students in the class they want to take for their career but they have to trust their teachers first then they can tell the students what careers that they what to take or what good classes are good for this career that the student chooses and thats my opinion on students should be commit to a career at a young age.

609,1967,9AFAE6562E98,"The purpose of always doing something helps us get different kinds of experiences, it helps us accomplishe what we are doing and gives a purpose to what we want to do in the future. Throughout life, the experiences that you get can help keep you motivated on what you should and shouldnt do as well. In comparsion, when you are inactive you arent benefiting from anything and you are just not getting enough experience for what you want to do in the long run. This is a major factor on how well you live your life and how you want your life to be. I do suppoort that we accomplish more when we are always doing something and it helps contributes to how we all live our daily lives. One factor why I believe that this contributes to our daily lives is that, it helps you get an education on something new or just a job that you are interested in. While, going to school and getting an education is a major rule in a human life; it is not for everyone and it all depends on how much effort you put in and if you are willing to put in the effort as well. In many different countries and cities, not all jobs require an education all you have to do is have experience in a certain area or part that makes you want to learn more. This helps decrease inactivity and upbulid activity while you are doing something like helping your community, feeding the homeless, giving advice to young kids. It all just depends on how well you put yourself out there and willing to make a committment about it as well. A second factor why I believe you feel accomplished by doing something is that, it gives you a purpose in life and a feeling that wont be given again. From my experience of helping kids with their homework afterschool it has always given me always a good feeling and making me proud that I am helping the community. This helped me gain self-satification for myself and let me understand the importance of showing kids at a young age how to be accomplished when you put the energy and time too. Another example I ever felt when doing somethingis when I play lacrosse , and how everytime I dont make my mile time I strive to do better for myself. Lacrosse has helped me put in an understanding on how self-satisfication doesnt come easy it takes time and effort. This benefitted me get motivated for what I should do more and always helping me understand that if I put in my time and energy then there wont be a problem on feeling accomplished. Doing something you love and getting that satisfication helps you serve purpose and feel more accomplished for yourself as well. One last example of how always staying active can help influence your accomplishment is that you are acknowledging that you are given a purpose to uphold. I do feel like many people dont seriously take the opportunites given and it is very hard to undertake as well. I would certainly always feel accomplished when doing something that can help let others know I care and not just for my own image. I agree that many different factors can influence decision making but also making others understand how important you are to someone as well. In conclusion, the more work you put in ;the more you are in feeling accomplished and in pleasing yourself as well. This can help give you a self-esteem boost for yourself and let others know that you are willing to put in dedication for yourself. Many people that I have talked to said that they have always felt like their ciommunity helps them grow and feel like they should give something back as well. Doing something remotely even small can benefit anyones day in comparsion in doing nothing. Working for what you need to do is different for working for what you want to do and this helps you understand the need for self -satisfication and social-satisfication.

610,1142,4B174612FD60,"Imagine oneself is a student in high school who is already stressed out by all of the homework and work that One must already finish during the day, but also all of the classwork that oneself did not get to finish during school. Students are already stressed out because of school work, letting a student use their phone as a learning tool would only benefit them in finishing their work on time. This is why teachers should let students utilize their phones as a learning tool and not be against the usage of it when doing school work. Admittedly, students could get distracted with their phones and not get their work done in time. However, Teachers can specify that the use of phones is only for academic use only during classroom hours. That anybody who is not abiding by the rules will automatically get ISS. Therefore, students would understand that it is a serious matter and would not be playing around with their phones and getting distracted. Furthermore, students would not have to wait on the schools slow internet and wifi to finish their classwork on time. Students phones work faster than most of the computers in school and they would be able to finish their work faster. For example at the beginning of the school year at SCHOOL_NAME the wifi and internet were down almost every day. Making everybody in the school that has online classes or just courses that require the use of the internet to be behind in all of their work. Also, schools computers are outdated and full of past information that makes the computers work at a much slower pace than a phone would. This is a contributing factor to students not being able to finish their work because the computers are outdated, it takes most of them at least twenty minutes to log in. Those are minutes lost that a student could have been using to have started their class work and possibly even finish it. Consequently, if phones were allowed to be used for class work then students would be able to finish their work on time and not have to worry is the wifi is working or if the computer is taking too long to log on. In addition, students could take their work home if they are not done with it, and they would not have to worry about being behind on their class work. Students most of the time do not have enough time during class to finish all of their class work. Making their work pile up high and since the school does not let students take computers home they could not take their work home with them. If students have class work on a specific computer app like Microsoft word they would not be able to access it from a computer at their house because they do not have the same system we have in school. For example, one of the classes that I take is econ and personal finance and a lot, if not most of the class is online. If we have to do a vocabulary in Microsoft word I have no way of accessing that document until the next day and by then we would have something completely different to do. Letting students use their phones to do work like in Microsoft word would mean that students could use their phones to type up their paper in Google classroom and send it in or leave it in the drop box in desire to learn. Hence, why letting students utilize their phones would be a great benefit to them. In conclusion, letting students utilize their devices as a learning tool or experience would be easier on them. If students are permitted to utilize their phones in the class room then they would not have to worry about not finishing their work during class. This is why students should sign a petition and turn it in to the principal, so the use of cell phones during class work can be permitted and not be frowned upon.",9,7,8,8,9,8,983,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
611,139,FF8BAC351714,"I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing the reason why i diagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep and they will not do there work the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this . The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone . Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them. Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn but other cant learn like that they need someone rigth next to them so the students can understand more better.

621,1210,3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldnt add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying. First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little. If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students. Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. thats why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day. Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havnt studied so I had to study, I wouldnt have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class. Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades. It will affect it by being late or not showing up to his or her after school activity, less time for the kids brain to rest, and not having time to finish homework or to study.

623,1038,D1A0AFC80A9A,"Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. it can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. But we can always change our character traits, its similar to an opinion on something or someone. We choose who influence us. we decide if we want to be happy or sad,making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds. Lets say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. You either wanna be like Kobe or be better than him. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. Some people believe we cant choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc.. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we cant change, its about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us. Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. Unlike,most kids that dont care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes and they choose traits with precautions. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve nothing big or anything to be proud of.

624,438,A1EC959B8C13,"Would it be surprising to know if students to know that students learning at home helps them not stress out as much? Stress is mainly caused by the students getting to much school work that cannot be handed in one night. Students complain about having too much homework and when working at home there is not any homework. Allowing any students to work on their own schedule help them become more motivated to work on their assignments. Students being educated at home gain more time to study and make up their own rules but responsible with it. Learning at home and not at school helps students to benefit themselves to get better grades. One of the advantage of homeschooling is it can be done anywhere and at anytime. Because it can be done by a touch of a good night sleep, students rise up in morning fresh and have a flexible time schedule. The students can work around their parents schedule instead of the parent working around the students schedule when it is time do some distance learning. Some students have trouble working at a school because they cannot understand the material at the pace set by teachers. The students cannot always work at the pace set by teachers. Distance learning allows students to work on their own pace and on their own schedule. Additionally, that there are no misguided rules about tardiness or how to dress. Because instead of worrying about the rules the students can focus on their studies. Distance learning can improve certain students learning process by having a more available schedule and by letting them learn in their own way. When taking a test or notes at school there are many distractions that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. This is another reason that learning from home benefits students. Learning from home doesnt have the distractions that a classroom has. As a result of this, students wont lose focus on the work they are doing resulting in better grades. One of the reasons students get distracted in the first place is because they are in a class where other just fooling around which makes others who want to stay focus feel uncomfortable. If a student learns from home they will feel more relaxed and comfortable and wont stress about work. In school, you are stuck at a desk listening to the teachers teachings for six hours and have a limited time to eat and take bathroom breaks. But there is other way around, if you are home, you can eat and do what you want when you want. Because of this, students will feel less pressured and get better grades then they would have if they were in school. There are still a few reasons not to do distance learning. There many more opportunities with public and private schools. People from different colleges dont go to students homes and try to advertise their career options. Making friends from home would be difficult without social interaction. Public and Private schools are great places to socialize during free time. If everyone goes home to attend school, funding for public schooling will fall and teachers will lose their jobs because of budget cuts. In public schools and private schools, depending on the teacher, cheating is hard to do. On the other hand, schooling at home, the students can easily look up the answers on the internet on a different device. So for all that matter it was you choose from not what want, it what you need. Students should be offered classes online or at home because it is less distracting and less stressful. The flexibility of the time students are allowed to complete work would benefit the mental health and grades of the student. With a more flexible schedule, students would be more likely to succeed and make good grades. Even though socialization in the school environment allows students to make friends. The conclusion of the argument was that it is highly doubtful that the lack of interaction could affect the student in adulthood. Many students all over the world successfully take some, and even all classes from home. In the near future, school systems and all districts should provide distance learning.",8,9,9,8,9,9,2170,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
625,2441,2B66CE2870AD,"John Lubbock is a British naturalist and politician that wrote a quote saying ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"". When saying this you have some opinions about it because your past can also make up your character and who you might become later on in the future. Why should we let your character take control of us, we have most of the control by the actions we take in our life. For example your parents were very abusive, and somehow your going to be that way to no its going to make you stronger and built your character up more then it was before. We have a choice to make up our character like some people will say ""oh shes mean, or ""why wont she share and its not her character maybe its her personality. You yourself built up your character and no one has to like it it but only you because at the end of the day all you have is yourself nobody else which is better then having someone judge you. No one can judge a book by its cover until they get to know who you really are and where you came from,your character can built you up and leave a legacy behind and you wont even know it because people will be proud of how you built your character up and ask ""how is she so strong ?"", ""how did she grow up to be independent?"". Once you tell them how strong you are and how your doing and the steps you took theyll be proud of you, because only you have control of how you can find your character traits. No one can really know for sure what makes up their chachater just by saying ""oh yea Ive done it before"" Lets say someone in your family died because of their sickness and you spend all those days being depressed and in denial that they are gone but guess what ? You are going to built yourself up and make them proud of whop they raised and who stood by their side and everyday your going to try and make every second count just to make them see how great your handling everything even if sometimes you might get sad here and there but,your still pushing through which is making your character stronger then your seeing it yourself. There are so many times in everyone life were they doubt themselves and want to give up because they think they arent capable of doing something but when youve realized from what youve accomplish the world doesnt seem so scary anymore, your brain will trick and say to you that you cant do it thats impossible and all these negative saying but, why should you focus on that so much thats not getting you through life its just bringing you down and you know that your character isnt meant for that its to push you and get you through all these brick walls that life throws at you only you can knock them down. So dont stop yourself from making a choice you know is right go with your gut and let your heart show you the ways dont let nothing in life stop you from what people think is impossible make it possible stand yourself out, make your character stand out because you are different no matter what. Your life isnt a pick and choose its what you think is best and fits for you so the saying goes ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make"", its your life have fun with it and make everything you do in life built up your character.

629,749,F3ACD9A99ADA,"Success is about to enforced our self and to accomplish our goals, as I know nobody was born knowing something everyone was born to learn and to fail every time that is possible to learn more However I agree with Churchills statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. My first reason is that everyone can protrude and be proud over our self ,and protrude means to take the best of us and show it, for example, in my case lass year I loss my job because I didnt have enough age to work in the company this year I start my own company and I have my own employees, this is a example how failure didnt take my enthusiasm, and that we can loss twice maybe but not forever because be will be success later. My second reason is that our attitude is everything we can infused others that have been losing their life and their enthusiasm and show them that everyone can enforced and get what they want, A example will be my cousin she had been in 12 grade for 3 years that at the first year that she didnt pass her grade herself confidence went down and she had loss her goals, but this year she will graduate because this year she is been preparing to pass her classes and to get her diploma, this is a example of been failing, and failing and then get the success. Other might say that success and failing isnt good for our society, however I sill disagree because to get success or to win we have to learn from the beginning, my third reason is that with the experience what we have of been losing and failure twice and twice we will know that we are going to do and be successful later.

In conclusion, this is why I agree with Churchills statement that is about the important role that failure plays in the success, My reasons are that we can protrude, influenced others, more personal experience. everyone is exert to failure but what we have to do is to continue and dont surrender dont give up with our goals, always been happy doesnt paying attention to the situation.

630,1114,22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit. Students would not benefit to attend classes from home because not just for studying in books but we go to school for another reason also, for examples we go to school for getting friends and that mean we have social. And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes. First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people. Second ,it is about activities for student. When they study,some subject they have to go outside from school for studying ;sure as scenes classes would go to a sea for studying about a sea,so if they go and see a real sea, students might get information more than they get from a book and can feel it. Students should do activities and study in books together it might help students understand.

If we want to make our life easy or conferrable it is not help full. for example if we have a two hours expanding the school day its not helping us because the using our schedule.

I grew up knowing when people put a lot of their afford to you, it means a lot because youll never know when people will trust you and believe in you again its a huge difference between those, and we people show us or make us see how important is when almost everything is easy when we ask for it example: Trying to hard to show how many things you have done for that person without asking, but it means a lot to you because you give a lot to that person and you hope that person can give you the same thing youve done for her or him.

635,1854,EFACA593A52B,"Can you imagine a world where every person is optimistic and responsible in their job. According to "" The Washington Post, "" 65% of the workers are hard-working and loves their job. ""Most employers are looking for specific characteristics in a potential employee. For example, they look for someone who is responsible and hard-working, and often they look for a person who has experience."" In some countries, start working at age of 15 years old is mandatory, because it helps to young people to obtain new views about different kind of jobs. Everyone has the capacity to be a responsible in their labor, but some people are hard-working because they want to accomplish their goals, and have an excellent record and experience from the last job is so important. The first reason why is so important to be a hard-working is because you can accomplish your goals. For example, my friend Generic_Name, she started worked when she was 16 years old, she studied and worked at the same time. Generic_Name worked very hard to accomplished her goals. Generic_Names goals was: be a teacher, buy a house, a car and save money for the College. It was not easy for her, but she was optimistic.

Generic_Name over time get a lot of experience and she inspired others people to do better their jobs. She won a prize for been doing well her job and supported others to inspire to do an extraordinary job. Working hard is the best way to demonstrate you can work in any place and loves your job. The second reason is when you are working is important to leave an excellent record, because it help to develop a good characteristics and experience. In some jobs, they call to ask for details about if the person have an excellent record and experience. Furthermore, my uncle Generic_Name, he just moved from New York to California, and he was looking for a new job. Generic_Name worked as an engineer in Villages Company . He was doing well his job in New York, but he needed moved. He went to apply in this new place, and the employers called to Villages Company asking for details about how he was doing his job when he was working for them, and then Villages Company says ""Generic_Name was one our best worker we had, he was responsible and he have the knowledge about his job."" The new company hired my uncle because he leave an excellent record. Hiring a person who has experience is important, because it help to develop better a job. Some people may argue that be a responsible and hard-working is not necessary in a job. However, be responsible is so important, because people are getting more experience and more capacity to do their labor. Some people do not like to follow the rules when they are in their jobs. In conclusion, we can not change the entire world, but start been responsible and working hard in our jobs is beneficial, because it is the place where we can inspire others to do their jobs well and any company will hire us for been excellent workers. Every labor is admirable, and we can care our jobs because it depends we can accomplish any goal we has in our life.

637,2060,E19E1BEB08EA,"I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. I also personally think that any project with a presentation should be a group project. If that presentation has more than just the presentation it should be a three person group. Working with a partner is beneficial to students, because it gives extra support or help on a project or classwork. If a project is too big and impossible for one person to complete they could split up the work. For example, when I had a final project in my english class; I separated the work with my partner. We had to do an essay and a PowerPoint presentation. My partner did the essay and did the PowerPoint presentation and we both finished in time. If I hadnt had my partner, I probably would not have finished the project in time. My teacher making it a group project made it way easier to do because I didnt have to worry about writing essay. Another reason that working with partners is beneficial to students is that they can build new friendship while doing work. When students are doing work in groups, they are together the whole class and have to stay in contact outside of school. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time Im making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job. Another way that working in partner benefits students is that it saves them time and makes them finish their work quicker. If the students split up their work and do their work efficiently they will finish quickly. The more group members will make it even quicker. For example, when I was working with a friend and two other students on a project for a book we finished the book very quickly and the book review was finished very quickly as well. When partners are helping each other it makes everything way easier and more fun as well, because you get to hang out with your friends while being productive. Also if the teacher lets students pick people, they can pick people that know a lot about the topic of the project or classwork. For example, in when I had spanish we did a project about Puerto Rico and since Im from Puerto Rico everyone wanted to pick me. I went to a group where a good friend of mine was and the project was very easy to finish and present. The project was done so quickly that the next class we had free time for the whole class. Thats another reason why working in groups is so beneficial and good. Working with partners can also make students more comfortable with the subject or the project. Students sometimes get handed a project or classwork without knowing what to do. Having a partner to help the out is great so they can get comfortable with the subject or the project. For example, when I was Earth and Space Science I had no idea what to do on a project the teacher was assigning. She assigned partners and my partner told me what to do and I finally understood. The project took us about two days to finish but it was a very hard project to do that would have been impossible to finish alone. Groups of at least three people should be required for project of more than 2 assignments. Two people cant do a project with five assignments and should have that extra person to split up the work and no one does extra work. For example, when I was in the sixth grade I had a project where I had to write about Mozarts story and I had to write an two paragraphs, buy and design a poster board, and also give a presentation and memorize everything. I did the essay but forgot to do the poster board until the night before. I had to stay up to 12:30 at midnight doing the poster and memorizing the 2 paragraphs. If the teacher would have made it a group project, I wouldnt have had to worry about the poster because my group members were on top of it. Another reason that groups of at least three people benefit students is that maybe one of the students doesnt want to do any work theres still another group member left that wants to do the work. For example, my english teacher gave us a presentation to do on PowerPoint and we split up the slides. But one of the group members didnt do anything, so the other group member and me had to do all of his work. We presented got points and he didnt. Thats why its so important to have groups of at least three people, because you still have a backup. Some people say working alone is beneficial for students because you only have to worry about yourself and no one else. However, if you work with a group or a partner the work gets done quicker and easier. While doing your work you can also make new friends and get help from them. Also, it helps pick out partners for the future that you know that those people will execute and do their work. For example, when I was working on a video for my journalism class I had a very big video that was due in a few days. I made good friends with the people that were in that group because we spent the whole class together and staying in contact after school. Every time Im making a video I want to work with them because I know they will do a good job and be productive. I feel that working with a partner is more beneficial to students. Working with partners gets students extra help when in need. It can make new friends while working on big projects. Also it makes the work get done easier and quicker when working in big groups. Bigger projects have to be at least a three person group because two people cant handle big projects by them selves and should have extra help.

Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Hes because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emersons statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said ""You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"". Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they dont continue their survey. Finally as you can see, Emersons statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.

For example, if they just wording around at night they dont know what can happened like they can get kidnap, and be at a place at a wrong time. They can think its cool but in reality its not. If a police men stop or pull you over you can get in to trouble because they gonna ask if your parents know you out or if they know where you at and if you said no they gonna call you parents and ask them to come and get you. Sometimes your parents can get worry if you not home. Kids want to meet up with there friends just to hang out but is it really worth it or to get in trouble knowing your friends aint gonna have your back. Curfew keep teens from getting in trouble. Although curfew can be good but it shows that your parents can trust you. Night can be really dangerous because you cant see in the dark and you dont know what can be out there. There can be drunk drivers at night also. Curfew is a law so if you go out late at night you would be breaking the law. Police man really do be canning this serious. All they want is kids to stay safe and be good also to listen to their parents. Teens think that meeting up with there friends at night is cool. But parents just want there kids to behave and listen so they wont get in serious trouble. Why lose your parent trust over some friends that aint gonna talk to you later in life. Be smart on what side you try to be. Not everything is all about friends you gotta put your parents first then your friends that why them made a curfew. Plus it the matter of respect for your parents. Curfew actually helps teens from doing wrong things. Teens dont think that there parents gonna find out but when they get that call saying mom you gonna get nervous or scared because you dontt know what to say for being at late. Parents can be smart at times when they want to but they do be catching here kids in the act of sneaking out ! Teens really do have a choice by picking stay home or go out and have fun. People really care about this law. Who wanna see a kid walking alone without no parent around. Teens just need to sleep or play on there gaming systems . You can hang out with your friends during the day or have a sleep over . Whatever you can do to hang out with your friends but DONT GO SNEKING OUT TO GO GET FOOD OR TO BE WITH YOUR GRILFRIEND! Just stay at home call up your friends or even your girlfriend so you wont put your self at a higher risk of getting in trouble. Overall just stay out of trouble and have your parents trust. Dont do nothing stuiped. Stay at home make do homework or watch a movie just dont sneake out jsut to do stuff thats gonna get you in trouble.",5,5,5,6,4,6,2303,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

641,768,C8EF7048C03F,"When youre looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one persons own opinion. One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur. Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others peoples opinions about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if its gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the ones in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help others or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the ones need in teaching One dislike I dont like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. Its really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",6,6,6,5,5,6,2732,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
642,2804,6C86103B510D,"Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Influencing others with your own behavior is the best example you can give. The example of showing someone your actions than your words is the best way to be an influence. The actions as words are powerful over anothers person life but I think that the actions are the best way to show someone who you really are. I agree with Albert Schweitzer because it is the best way to influence others by showing and doing your own behavior. People follow others because they like the other persons personality does not matter is it good or bad. We always have been influenced in our lives by our family,society, school, and now more than anything the social media. Some people might no agree with Albert Schweitzer because they might say people are what they want to be not necessary being influence for someone. Also other people might say that people act and react to situations depending on how they feel at the moment and how the situation was based on. However I believe that people are always being influence for someone else without maybe they noticing, that is why I think there is always someone looking at us and maybe we are not paying attention, but our actions and reactions is the only example we can give to others to follow. I also believe that actions speaks louder than words, that is why for us to be the influence over someone elses life there is nothing better than our own behavior. We all have our own personality,likes and dislikes and sometimes those ""likes and dislikes"" can be an influence for someone else. In my opinion peoples actions are really important and have a powerful influence over others. Albert Schweitzer said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" I believe this is true because at some point of our life we have been influence for someone else looking at how they are and what they do.

643,2978,738112C600B8,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change ? In my opinion a first impression on someone or something change be changed, because you never know what the stereotype of the thing can be. When you first meet someone your first impression on the person can be one thing but you never know what the person could have. For example you see a fat guy or female and you can be quick to judge them but you dont know anything about there life, till when you talk to them and get to know their true story that they medical conditions on why they are the way the appear and look like. You could meet a Hispanic, For example you might thing they came to US illegally, but you dont really know that some Hispanic are actually born in the united states and are legal citizens. when you see a Asian person you may think there smart because of your first impression stereotype, but not all Asian are actually smart and appear to who you really think they are. Next is the type of thing you purchase or are going to purchase, it can look nice and be expensive but you dont know the background story on the item or thing you are going to purchase. For example when you want to purchase a car or house, you can be looking at it on the internet and like it a lot but once you buy it you start noticing strange thing. If it is the car you realize the its starting to give you a lot of problems that you are constantly taking money out your pocket to try to fix it to your expectations and what were your first impression on the car being nice and reliable. Second a house youre impression where ""oh wow this is a really nice house"", so you go on and purchase it the you start realizing that the house was making wired noises at night while you are trying to sleep, Then one day you go online and contact the landowner or research the history of the house and realize the house is haunted because the original owner past away their. A first impression is just a stereotype or judgment that you think of someone or something before not know the background story on it. Before you go and be quick to judge some based on their looks talk to the person see why they are really the way they look before making fun of them of talk about them because everyone in this world isnt perfect and everything has a story behind it.

Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try.

The pros are that you learn more its good because schools get out earlier for the summer so their more summer days to enjoy. Another pro is if you have question on your homework the teacher can help you out by teaching you and you dont have to worry about the time because you have plenty of minutes to learn. Second If their were longer classes kids will lean more things and pay attention,if its their favorite class well it will be good for them because its longer. For me I love music class if i have more time in that class i could learn more things about music and i could be better player. Third pro it give us more time to hang out with our friends because your could be busy because they sports or church. Well for me i cant hangout with my friends because i have strict parents they wont let me get out of the house unless i have good also they dont let me hang out with friends so the only way i can see them is at school. Fourth pro is you can get to know your teacher and the students in the class you can learn many new thing about the teacher that you would never know about sometime its cool to hear their story because it could teach you something or can make you laugh. So i learn that their many good thing of having more time in a school day. The cons of having one hour and thirty minutes in school day. First con is kids will be tired and they wont think that much or pay attention because all their energy is gone. The kids will be rude and wont do anything because they are tired or hungry. Well the only way to fix this to give them snack yeah that could help but how your going get the snack you have to buy them with money they are going to tell the kids to buy the snacks and the schools wont buy it. Second con is if the kid has doctor appointment they will go and the next day they will miss a lot of stuff in class and they make it up and the teacher wont teach it again because they have to move on and learn something new. Third con is classes will be harder because you have remember a lot of stuff for the test that your going to have that week. Honestly for me everyday when i get home i take a nap if dont have that nap i will be mad all night so many other kid could be just like me when they dont get a nap they are really rude so that bad for them ant the teachers also you will see kids falling asleep and teacher will yell at them. So i learn that their many not so great things of having more time in school. In the end they are many good like getting help for work and their may bad things like getting tired.

It is very dangerous at night, and anybody that is out after midnight increases their chances of doing wrong or becoming a victim. Teenagers are still learning how to fit into this puzzle of life, and without a curfew to guide them bad things are bound to happen. Teenagers do not understand when their parents tell them no, and think a curfew is not needed because they are invincible and bad things never happen to them. Teenagers need to learn that being more responsible, mature, and becoming a contributing member of society starts with having limits. Curfews will benefit not only teenagers, but society as a whole. Teenagers think being responsible is not a good thing, because they never want to be told what to do. If you want graduate from high school you have to be responsible. Going out after midnight is not being responsible. I have already loss friends to violence, and it occurred late at night. I have friends that have jobs, and they work after midnight even on school nights. They have trouble staying awake in class, and their grades are not good. A curfew would also address this situation and help them succeed in school. Being mature at sixteen is hard for some, but it needs to happen. Parents need to show their children part of maturing is doing the right thing. Being mature is understanding that you do not need to be outside late at night. Maturity helps us understand that in life we can not always do whatever we want. I have friend that complain about not being able to stay out late, but as they mature they will understand that a curfew really helped keep them safe. Going outside after midnight is very dangerous. Teenagers must understand that with everything that has gone on the past decade with gun violence, drugs, and robberies; most of it occurred late at night. There is a reason that most places are closed late night, and there is really nothing to do late at night. Teenagers need to value their safety, and know that whatever they can not do before midnight does not need to done. Curfews can help with this mindset and keep teenagers safe. To reiterate, society as it is now needs to support teenage safety, and a curfew is crucial part in making this happen. Parents should support being more strict with their childrens curfew. Midnight is more than enough time for teenagers to experience life. There is really nothing good for teenagers out past midnight. Teenage life is one of the most difficult times in our lives as we still are trying to constantly learn.

It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take. One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time, which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games.

All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

650,1913,03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future. The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight As. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever. The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like im on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like im on top of the world, I want something big for me."" Many students may say that they dont care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""Whats the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we dont need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendys."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school. In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, Im most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well.

In todays society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future. Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible. If having a year off, and dont know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that ive never seen before.

653,1158,41DF6D292056,"In this essay we are going to discuss the various issues related to working in a group and working indvidually. The idea here will be to study the pros and cons with ralation to the particular indvidual and not to the group of which she is a part. First we will try to understand the dynamics of a group vis a vis individual, then understand the various issues involved in working as a part of the group. We would also see as to how those issuse will be influencing the person, be it in the positive side or being a hindrance. Remamber last time when you had to do your project. You must have contemplated doing it by many ways. But some thing that comes to mind very in the beginning is either individually or in a group. Every body by facto knows what it is to be individual and perform a task individually, as she is the only person who is doing the task. But what is group and how it is formed and what are the dynamics involved in it. So what is a group, we may dedine it as a collection of several people who come togethor to do a particular task or goal. And the group form, their structure and process and also deals with how it is functioning. This aspect of group dynamics is relevant in formal and informal groups of all types. In any organisational entity groups are very common entity and hence their study and group dynamics is an important area in the study of oranisational behaviour. Being with group dynamics let us see what exactly it is about, it basically deals with why and how groups are formed and developed. In order to explain the same many theories have been proposed. While group work has a host of merits, it also has its flip sids. Firstly, individual students usually lack the power to control the task as compared to when the work is assigned to one person for completion. Additionally, some group members tend to dominate in terms of contributions while othors may become dormant. In this case, the group may achieve its goal but limit other students.

654,1768,C71E90669DFA,"Almost everyone in the world had a big problem in their life. Problem is not rare this days. However, if you think of it problems is not that bad as you think. Like what Duke Ellington said "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best"", and I agree on what he said. I have several reasons why I agree on Dukes statement. My reasons are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. Problems make us work/push harder. Many buisnessman have many problems. But they work hard and hard because problems make us work harder. Like what the movie(Your My Boss) said ""A Good Buisness-man Need Problems To Do Better"". Problems make us to push harder. Its like we are the turtle in the race where the turtle and bunny/fox race. I compare it like that because the bunny/fox is like the problem we want to face it and end it. My other reason is that problems create/set our goals. When a person have a problem of course their going to create/set a goal to complete. Like what happened to me when I was a kid. I never seen my brother since I was 3 years old. So, I created a goal that I want to see my brother again,and it did happen. Problems make us create goal to achieve. My brother and me are a great example of that. Problems are pushing to set a goal that we will create the opposite of problems. Problems set as goals that we would not do the same mistakes again. Last but not the least, problems make us learn from our mistakes. Because before problems mistakes comes first. When I got a problem I always ask my self ""What did I do wrong?"". Then, when I know whats the reason I just dont do it again so no problems will be created. When you learned your mistakes and dont create another problem their where it proves that ""Problems make us learn from our mistakes"". Brain and feelings are created so we cant make the same mistakes as before. So we can prevent many similar problems in our life. My reasons why I agree are that problem make us work/push harder, it creates/set our goals, and importantly it make you learn from your mistakes. All of these reasons are very important to know. So you can understand why problems are not bad as you think of. Problems make us push harder, create goals, and the most important part it make us learn from our mistakes. Problems are the reasons why the world is still together and not fighting. Problems make us go together and help each other. Humans are created to enjoy life and learn from problems to problems.",5,6,7,5,6,6,2705,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
655,349,34E4FB64EEBA,"Dont you think that we should be what we are no matter who is around? Is important that we give or have our own opinion. For me, my opinion is always important because is what it makes me unique, and what I think is that I know that some people is afraid to be what they are. Because they are afraid to the reaction of people that they love, for example the most important person in my life is my mom and she is the center of my life, like my dad... But you know something? Im nervous about the reaction of them, if I act like I want, If I dress the way I like it, Im afraid that my family or my friends judge me. I think that the author ""Ralph Waldo Emerson"", is right. Im agree with the Idea that he have about the world. People around us is just looking for something to talk about and if for example, I do something wrong, the friends of my mom will talk about me and in a worst case, my mom will do the same. The world influence a lot in ourself in many ways for example: You will see people following what other person say if he move to one side he or she will do the same. When we are little people influence, tellling you to do the same that the other kid is doing. In some schools they dont let you to use imagination, like, you have to do what is there and in my opinion the kids should be free to write or draw what they want. I think that it will help to develop our ideas and be succesful. Mom always is telling you to be like him or she. That she wish this and that and we are tryinng to do those things and be like they want, that we forget about us and we try to be someone else. We have many expectations about what we can be, how many things can we accomplish, we make many questions to ourself and we try to be someone that is not us, just to make happy the rest of the people, when we should be looking for our own happiness, life is short, life is now and we have to be what it makes us happy, life doesnt make sense if we live in a place or have people around us that is just stealing our happiness. The world is big and is true that influences, even in our decisions. We have the choice to be what we want. Is our decision, is our opinion, is important to be what we are and not what they want. There is some people that is not agree with this idea. They think that the world is not trying to make you someone else, that there is not any influence and be what the other people tell you to be, that the opinion dont affect and it shouldnt have any problem to act or be what they want. But, I think that people around us can influence in our decisions, because we dont want that people we love get upset about us. We are always worried about the opinions of the rest and that is a big example of how the world influence about us and in our personality. We all have have something that it makes us unique and special of be. Everybody have different opinions, and there are some people that want others to follow what they said and is not the way it works. The world have many of good things and bad things but what will happen if we just follow what they said, people that is guiding is thinking that it will have the same or better results, but no, we have different results to the differents situations and thats why is important to be what we are and do what we like, because in that way, we know how to act to the situation and if will be a good thing for us to follow, is very important that we show ourself and get courage to confront many difficult situations.

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they dont gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they dont rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because its unnecessary because its not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day dont gonna make a big change and also, maybe its okay as its and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it dont make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe dont do enough hours of work and dont get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way. These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these. The problem with the schedules and the save of energy and resources, are some of the benefits and disadvantages I thought for these theme and in my opinion its not a good idea to change something what is already working with something who maybe not work very well and something who is dont give big changes.",6,4,6,6,5,6,3487,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Most students that are special , speaks different language or problems could and should take online classes. Even if you dont have problems you could take online classes if you wanted too. You dont have to go to school and learn , you stay home and learn in the computer. Homeschooling and online classes could be different but the sames at the same time. Learning at home could be better for you. Because at school cause you dont have no one to bother you , or giving you bad ideas , or cause trouble at schools on you learning experiences. Some students would have benefits from being able attend classes from home? Some benefits could be like. "" What if its a bad idea to do it ? "" , "" What if I dont do good at it ? "" or "" What if I cant do it at home or at school ? "". Some have different ideas that it could be better for them to learn. At school it mighty be different cause there a lot of teacher and students that be different than you. At online school your at home with your parents and siblings? ad have only one teacher that teaches you on the computer. Its your dession to choose school to learn or online whatever that you comfortable for you to learn. For me if I could choose , Ill choose going to school. Why? because its more better for me to learn from a teacher in person and see what they are do for me to learn. Online its okay , but staying at home make me get lazy and too comfortable by staying home. So for me to learn , is by going to public or private school are better for me to learn , educate , and socialize to others , its better for me. So online classes are not for everyone. Like me I perfer going to school , not taking classes online. But what I say "" whatever that make you comfortable for you to learn "". For me is going to school learn amd talk to other students. Wahtever you chosses for you to do then do it. Online classes are greate! but for dome people dont think so, So my option are both some students benifets to do online or some doing it school.

Its only going to make people struggle. Myself, however, agrees because putting yourself to a challenge can make people explore or learn many things. That is how many people become so talented at things they do now. Going beyond can raise your confidence higher. My first time experiencing playing the flute was very difficult. The more time I practiced the notes and songs, the easier it got for me. After awhile, I wanted to to play a different instrument. The second instrument option for me when I began playing the flute was a violin. It was more difficult than playing the flute but eventually I got used to it. The more things anyone can accomplish, the more challenges there will be to be completed to improve growth. School is a good example of improving yourself. There are specific kids who has disability in learning called Special Ed. The experience of being in self-contained classes were easy. For the kids who are capable of being in a larger group class have to make growth in order for them to be in a co-taught class or regular classes.

Many times that I have worked on something by my self I always wonder about many things or opinions about my work and it is hard for me to check if it is good or what would people think about my work.

I have seen some teachers having a hard time grading and explaining at the same time because every single student is working by their own. Teachers must have their students working in a group than alone because as I see it is more benefitial and better,this will have students to come up with better work and they also get to interact with diferent people and learn from them.",8,8,7,7,8,8,1059,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Students has tried to make the school lunch meals change, but there wasnt any difference. Sometimes the studentst doesnt make good healthy food choice there will be times that the lunch menu will have healthy choices and not so heathly choices. For example: the lunches gives us two options one is pizza and the other rice with chicken, students will definitly go for pizza. It would be a good idea that the school lunches menu changes to a healthy menus. We do need to consider other students and their eating habbits, most students doesnt even eat, they even go a whole day without eating.

Some students are vegan so maybe they can have a veggie burger anything with veggies. If thats the case to change school lunch menu, the school should consider about how and where they should spend money on things like changing the floor tiles its unnecessary it could have been for something better. No one really cares about how bad the school lunch is, its not worst thing in the world. Anyways thats why us students have to be smart and bring our own food to school like most of them do.

664,570,F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want. The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish. Churchills statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it. The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves. I agree with Churchills statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real. Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job. In conclusion, the Churchills statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",7,6,7,6,6,6,3606,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

In conclusion my impressions about her it was starting to change but I decide to talk with her to see what was happening, before that I start saying that she change and my impressions about her change. is bad to change the impressions about a person without knowing what is happening in their life,because you dont know if that person is waiting for you to ask them what is happening.

However from what think if you are alone out of no where and you dont have any exprerience is much better because you get to have your experiences and no one bothers yours plans. You make your own decitions and follow your own rules. On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you dont follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules. To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes. you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions. Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person. Fanally the last reason why you should be aonle is that no one is going to bother you you will make every thing in your hands and no some one else hand they will not be on your back bothering you you will make every thing posible on your hand and if you are alone you will become and expert on the jod,company,schools the things that you do you will be the head on your decitions and you are no going to use some one else head and if you use their head they will correct you in what you do and if you do is like from what they thing is better ithey will be bodering you and that is not to good because it will be bad why it will be bad?

To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end.

It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that thats why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash cans when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i dont think another person would pick it up but they should. We dont want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. Thats why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others dont want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community.

He genially answer their question with respect and calmness like one kid asked how old are you, He replied saying that ""Im 14 years old"" Even though Some kids were being rude to him some of them even try to bully him,but cause of his attuide no one couldnt do much. He had no problem talking with teachers and other kids cause he wasnt feeling shy to talk with them he was happy and he was making an eye contact with everyone hes talking with. The kid probably had fun he made new friends earlier than other kids that were new. So thats why having a attitude not always means bad.

Ill give you an example, I like to read adventure books. When Im reading this type of books I love to imagine how happy would I be if I was that type of person doing that type of adventure. Imagination is an awesome tool to use when you are reading a book. If you love reading this type of books use your imagination, use it to enjoy what you are reading. Do you have a favorite sport, or a favorite player. Imagine you were a soccer player, a basketball player, or any type of player. Imagine how wonderful and amazing would that be. If I was a famous soccer player I would be Lionel Messy. When Im watching soccer I start to imagine that Im Messy and that Im the one who is scoring all those goals. You can imagine a lot of things, you can imagine you being a scientist, artist, and a actor. Thinking of a place to visit for vacation. If you have a lot of stress take a break and sit down in your couch and imagine your dream vacation. Lets say you want your dream vacation in Hawaii. Imagine you are surfing on those big waves, sky diving, and learning how Hawaiian people dance. Also you can learned about the culture and generation about Hawaii.

I think that commit to a career at a young age is a great idea, because it help student to prepare for the future. I think is a great idea, because students decide there future at a young age. The student are not going to have time to be doing bad things with there friends, they are going to focus more in the school and in there future. And that way we as student we are going to have batter future, we can be more batter in what we do. It will help us to be more mature, it will help us to act like adult, because we are doing things of adult. it will help us to appreciate the life. I know many people that they witch they could have a better career, but they dont have it,because they havent being associate with career courses. I have a friend that he would love to have the career that he wants, but he didnt had experience in what he want, because he had never being associate with the career that he wanted, when he took the decision to have the carer that he wanted, it was to latte. That is why is batter to commit to a career at a young age, because it will help us to be more professional in are career. That will help us to be more responsible.

677,786,E0656353B8F2,"School districts shouldnt give the three year instead of four year program. Why? because students should receive all the education they need to succeed everything they want with completing four years of high school. Most colleges look for students that have completed four years of their high school education, also they dont like when students have free periods unless they have a specific reason of requesting free courses. Students will always have time to do what are they want in life with a four year high diploma it doesnt matter if your birthday is late and you want to graduate with three years because you dont wanna graduate at that specific age. Teachers, parents,siblings, they should be the ones telling theyre children or young adult that it is important to complete there four years of high school. The process you have to follow to do a three year of high school is more stressful because you have to summer school or evening school where there are not really a lot of teachers to help out with most of the stuff you need help with. When your in school you have English, history, science, mathematics teachers, you have counselors librarians everyone that can help you with anything you need to finish high school. Most students may graduate early because they have an illness, disease, or something and they just cant take the pressure of being in school no more. From my point of view parents should always talk to there children about how important education is for them they can pursue all there dreams if the parent didnt have the opportunity to finish there high school career. Also entering college early wouldnt be so convenient because maybe the student missed something they didnt learn then when they get to college there like my teacher didnt teach me this or I dont know what that is. The work force accepts a lot of young teenage children that graduate from high school and expect them to have a high school diploma and of course theyll have a high school diploma but they wont know how many years they completed which I believe still shouldnt be accepted. Children think that just because they have a high school diploma theyre better then everyone else if you only completed three years you shouldnt feel superior to everyone else. I would feel disappointed in myself for not completing all the four years I needed because I would feel like I didnt complete everything I need to be the most intelligent most outgoing person I am. If your a child that believes you cant do it and finish high school because its stressful, of course you can do it I punish myself all the time for saying that. I may not be the most smartest person in my family but im giving it my all to complete my high school career as an older sister and role model of two younger siblings that I have. Also if your a three year completer you should always take younger siblings in to consideration because they look up to you and they are gonna think that just by completing three years its OK. To be someone successful in life finish all four years of your high school education schools shouldnt provide three year programs for students or at the age of eighteen they can drop out they are going to get no job no one will accept them without an education. There is nothing good out in the world without an education or some type of proof that you have completed or have gone to school. In conclusion, to all of this children, teenagers, anyone take in mind that colleges, jobs, anything will most likely look for a four year completer because if they see you as a three year completer theyll take the other person instead of you. Even if you have all the requirements you needed to complete high school you still really didnt finish your career. Schools should stop providing this program and make students complete there four years in high school because it is very important for them to get an education till they are 18 and they are free to make their own decisions if they want to drop or just do three years of high school. And dont be the type of person to just finish high school with three years and do nothing after you have decided to not finish school you just decide to drop out to be home and do nothing for yourself. Be the bigger person and take full responsibility of your education because you only have yourself throughout your journey in high school there will be no friends once it comes down to your senior year in high school. The more you pressure your self to finish high school the more stressful and painful itll be for yourself because you may not have all the requirements completed and you have to complete them in summer school thats why parents and teachers mentors anyone should always come in and talk to the child and make them finish what they have left of there high school career nothing is impossible. Do what you can to complete and finish high school with all your four years and youll be the most hard working work force person ever or the best and college student that completed all four years and will complete all her college years needed to succeed to accomplish there dreams or whatever they want to do.",7,5,7,7,5,6,3194,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
678,911,CA73BDEC2752,"I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals. As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals arent made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work. I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character. In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings.

Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesnt have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours. Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Some people believe in praising a students to build self-esteem, even if the work is not the students best effort, also so meany people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standars, I agree with this one because as humans we are, while more peole are praising us, we just will start to act maybe worngly because is too much attention. Teachers might support students to get better as people also keep getting motivated while theyre doing a test or classwork, sometimes with words to make them feel they are doing a great job but they shouldnt do that everyday because not everyone notices the value those actions has. First, If for example there were 3 students who are very lazy but they start to do better things, the teacher will probably praise them because they made an ""effrort"" but if teachers start to do that everytime,students coul act as lack of attention even if they dont, and there is the problem, of course students must be more confident in orden to learn when they are making some efforts to do their work,however some of them just take advantege of that, when they just think because they have good grades they should to get an achievement or praises from others, even if they dont. In addition, If in our own homes parents do teach us whats to have a good self-lesteem and how we have to be, well not need the approvetion ur opinion from other people and it will be enough because wed already know how to act like, and just to think that we need an achievement or praising from someone to prove were good on something, its completetly wrong, you dont have to get an achievement to prove youre good on something you like it or enjoy to do. The only thing we have to do is always make an effort, just prove to yourself you are good on something because you want to, not because youre waiting for an action from a person, also not everytime you have to get sometime to prove you are doing a good job bc you are not always to do a good job, beacuse nobody is perfect and everyone has a lot of mistakes, just do it for yourself. Not always everything is gonna be super easy in life to us, sometimes you have to go through several situations that will make you grow as a person, every humanve had self-esteem issues at least once and thats alright. I think we shouldnt depend on a opinion to get better each day for ourselves, weve to notice we are not perfect, we have mistakes and not everyone always will be cheering up us, we have to fail once or more and then just get up and keep going, with our skills and mistakes also knowing that not always we have to get something to prove our knowledged, thats where self-esteem comes from.",7,6,5,6,6,6,1264,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
683,2351,745F880CEFA7,When someone is asking for advice they might talk to more than one person because someone might have better advice than someone else or might have better and more advice than somebody else. I think people ask multiple people because the person who is asking for advice wants the most advice and best information and opinions from others. Another reason why someone might ask multiple for advice is that everybody has different experiences throughout their lifetime and might know more stuff because of those experiences throughout their lifetime. People might ask the elderly for advice because their wise and have lived a long life so they might know alot of information to pass on. Everybody has different opinions but hearing different opinions from others can help you make a better choice. I think you should ask your parents for advice first before you ask anybody else for advice because your parents are the one the ones who raised you and they know whats best for you. For example your parents probably told you when you were little to not to talk to strangers because they know its the best for you. Your parents also might have told you that to always tell the truth because its not good to lie. By asking alot of people for advice and hearing other peoples opinions and experiences throughout their lifetime you now know alot of information and advice from others with that you can make a better choices.,6,6,7,7,6,6,1512,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

We do not have to lose hope at failure. Failure is the key to success. We learn the lesson from our mistakes. If we will not do the mistake so, how would we learn the things more better. We should learn the things from our failure instead of losing hope. Encourage yourself and other when you you are facing the failure is a good thing. If someone fails again and again in their goal, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope,determination about goals and be enthusiastic. We need to help people if they need us,if we see someone who are losing their hope because of the failure, we have to encourage them for not to lose hope. Because if they lose hope, they are destroying their dreams and goals by their own hands. At least we have to try something until we reach to our goal. There was a spider, who wants to go to his home but he was not reaching to his home because it was so high, he tried first time he failed, he tried second time he failed but he did not lose the hope. When he tried the eighth time, he reached to his goal just because he did not lose the hope. We have to try as many time as we can but never lose the hope. We should have determination about our desire. If we are determine about our desire then we can reach to our goal. For the success we have to do a lot of things like hardworking but the main point is determination. For instance if we think we can not do this thing then its really happen. First we have to prepare our minds that this is my desire and I will have to reach my goal. There is nothing wrong to make or see the dreams but the determination about your dreams can take you to path of success. Be enthusiastic about your work and goal is the great way for success in life. We have to be thrill about our goal. Enthusiasm is a great thing, we have to learn from the failure with out loss of enthusiasm. In the pursuit of success we do not have to be sad. Be happy that you learn from your mistake and now u can do that better than before. From the failure we are getting more experiences. For example when teens go for their first job, they do not have experience. They do not know how to manage their time in job, how to take customers and how to deal with the difficult situations. Every day they do mostly mistake and learns from their failures. At the end of the year they are master in everything but if they do not lose hope and be enthusiastic about their work. Life is so hard but we can make it easy if we don not lose hope, be determine about our goal and be enthusiastic. To gain the success we have to do a lot of hard work but if we fail at any point we do not have to lose hope and just sit down because we fail. We have to learn from our mistake and just try, try and try until you reach to your goal. If we fails after hard work it does not mean we can not fulfill our dreams. However if we fails after a lot of hard work it means we have to try again. Because hard work will never waste so just keep trying until you reach your goal. So, we should never have to be afraid from the failures. It is good for us to learns more from failure and do better next time. Never give up on your dreams and desires.

Some people believe students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, however, home school is a great way of student to attend classes because they can focus in their studies, its more safer, and they can avoid bad influence from others. Attending classes through online or video conferencing has a lot of benefits like what I mention from the first paragraph, that homeschooling can help students to focus in their studies. For some reasons, some students that go to school cant be focused on their studies/activities because they are distracted by some of their classmate that is very naught. For instance, there are some people that born in this world that are very naught, like even you defy him/her they will not listen to you and then sometimes, some of the other students will raise their pride and just walkout from their class because they dont want to listen any objection from their action. Another reason for home schooling is that, its more safer for them to study. For example in todays society, a lots of bad things happening in the world, like school shootings that cause a lot of innocent students to die, like what happened in Florida, a few months ago. One of the reason also of homeschooling is that, they can avoid bad influence from others.

He become involved in activities like staying after school while he was in high school because he wanted to improved in the school, and be a good student. As a result, he thinks that maybe is not necessary being involve in so many activities to enrich a educational experience.

Not only the extracurricular activities enrich the education, being involved in activities allows a student to have little time to do homework assignments as well. Additionally, some students become involved in activities like sports and they have little time to do their homework or study.

If she doesnt stay after school every day, then she probably will have more time to complete her homework. She thinks that it can possible to her because she shows interest in what she wants.

Lastly, students who get involved in activities after school they obtain little time with their families. However, many students likes to participate in activities of the school. In particular, Generic_Name is a student who likes to participate in the activities of the school. She likes to participate in the class activities, games, and clubs. She likes to stay after school because she is participating in one club. She just stay after school on Mondays, Wednesday, and Fridays. When she stay those days she pass little time with her family. If she doesnt stay these days, then probably she will have more time in the afternoon with her family. Plainly, the participation that she demonstrate in the sport she improve as athletic. Some people say that involved in activities will impair some students because they can focus more in participating in activities, and not focus in their class grades. However, this idea is inaccurate. For illustration, Generic_Name is a student and he participates in a club where he obtain help with his homework, and projects. When he dont understand his homework assignments he go to the club. If he didnt participate in the club, then likely he will no receive help from the club. Therefore, participating in other activities the students can obtain help with their homework, projects, and improve their grades. In conclusion, participate in activities can be helpful to some students. Many of students prefer to participated in extracurricular activities to improve their educational experience. Secondary, some students become involved in activities, and allows students to not have so much time to finish their homework.

Others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. The age shouldnt determined how committed you can be to a career. Being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits. Early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. For example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. Starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. Those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. Your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience. Making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. For example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. So, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. Starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. This gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesnt need to be taught. Having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them. The students will have some confidence before going into their career. For example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you wont expect anything new. This will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into theyre career. Before entering a career its good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. A boost of confidence is what students need before going into something. On the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. For example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. Some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. So, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they cant decide on some of the most simplest decisions. Those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision. Having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. They get to learn more in advance then the rest. Also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. That many positive outcomes will come out of starting early.

The younger students can help the older students what they learned and teach them how the problems works again. A lot of older students forgot what they learned in the past and its stressful. In sixth grade, my teacher lets all sixth grades read with 2nd graders and its how younger and older bonds little bit. The younger and older students can bond eachother in the program. They can learn from eachother what they do in their own grades to lighten up the day without awkwardness. Its a teamwork program that helps younger and older students to assist for eachother. Its like a group project and they have to work with eachother to finish the project and helps eachother step by step. One time i was little a older student alway read to me and slowly we bonded, Its was nice at the end of the day. Bonding is a key to success of learning from eachother and we are the same person with different thoughts and mind.",4,5,5,5,4,5,1887,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 4"
698,923,C676CE973E9E,I think that by extending the school hours is not a very good idea. Because there might be some students that have things to do after school and teacher as well. It well effect everyone at the school because there are some student that dont like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will effect the school and them. I dont think it well be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day. Some student might have to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it well get dark and then they cant walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people. By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they dont want to and that will effect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that wont help them at all. If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end. Some teacher are going to have some thing to do and work at thing at there homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have think to do they will not be abole to do it and that will make them mad and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student. So that is why we shouldn do it because it will effect a lot of people and then it will make al lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we have it will help a lot of people.,6,6,6,6,5,6,2694,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

701,2055,D0A5FF29C338,"First impression counts the most and its impossible to change. A person point of view on someone can never changed because of the many thoughts that go throught the mind, after getting to know that person because no one would want a friend like that. Having a serious face, not taking care of yourself and dressing wrong can lead to having a bad impressions, thats when people think of you in a different way and get things wrong that are not true,but due to the bad first imprsssions it change everything. Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example youre life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that. People now days dont want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people dont want to talk to you because all it wouldve took was a smile. Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just dont care about yourself why would you care about others. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesnt take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you dont smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you. Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and youre wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they dont know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they dont have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference. In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they dont talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important.

We never know if tommorow will ever come for us to do the tasks that could be important.

When we dont do anything get stressed out, and worry about it to much, more then were suppose to. Doing nothing is easier then doing something, but doing nothing has a bigger consequence then doing something. Around the world, there are people that accomplished alot, always by doing something, and not by doing nothing. There are Entrepreneurs around the world that didnt wait to do something with themselves.

A couple of years later Apple came to be to what it is today, Steve Jobs worked hard to get his company to where is today, by working hard and not by doing nothing, but by always doing something. Steve Jobs is a great example of how much great can come by doing some. These two Entremreneurs are great examples of doing something, great should come. They both worked so hard for their companys, not waiting a day for something to be complete. Doing nothing will not get anyhting done, neither will waiting.

Positive attitude even helps you to maintain good heath and this will help you to get success. But if you have a negative attitude in a situation you might not get success in life.

705,1217,E9E68651B168,"I disagree on extending school hours. I disagree because if the school board adds more morehours to school, students wont pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Another reason is that students will start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours and they will start to get more tired or start to go a sleep. I also think that teachers might get anoyed by students replying on why the school board added extra hours of school. I think that instead of adding the extra hours to school, the school board should just make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so kids can come and learn more about life and school. First of all, I disagree because if the school board adds more hours to school students wouldnt be able to concentrate or pay attention in class. I believe that if students dont pay attention in class or to the teacher, the teacher will get very upset and students will start to get in trouble or would start losing points. I believe that the students dont pay attention in class or to the teacher, they would begin to be disrespectful to teachers and wont be respectful to others. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher. Second of all, I dont agree because I think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school. They are going to start asking a lot of question and their teacher isnt going to like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school. Students should talk to their parents on why the school board is extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra. Third of all, I believe that the school board shouldnt increase the amount of hours the should just make it an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board shouldnt extened the school hours for students because students can just study hard for something or teachers should go over the subject the are learning about so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school theyh will get so board and they wouldnt want to be there. I decline on the idea that the school board wants to increase more hours for students. I decline beacuse students will get very bored and wouldnt want to do anything. The school board should think it over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school.

However Im in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers. Allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on. Every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, But for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as others. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life. Every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they dont feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; However companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to. Not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they dont have the sources to reach their goals or they cant because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they dont have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. I believe im not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life. Lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who dont have any chance on achieving their goals. its very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure.

Say you were to get a 75% on a math test but you wanted to get a better score you did study, but didnt show up to class , or stay after school to get extra help.

Students self-esteem comes from achievement, once one goal is achieved students will have confidence, which will cause students to achieve more goals. Students achieving their dreams will encourage others to try their hardest to succeed more. Students will become better leaders by encouraging others to accomplish their dreams as well. This will give students a mindset to not give up easily. When students see others achieve their goals it gives them hope to be able to do the same, which leads to students trying their best to turn in their assignments on time and give their full effort on topics theyre given.

714,425,45697CF2448C,"Do you like to extend your school hours? I think extending the school hours do your life more easier because you dont have to do homework at home. You can do your homework in the school and you can ask for help. I agree with extending the school day because I like go to the school and you have more time to stay with your family because you dont have to do your homework. My first reason is I like to extending the school day because when the teachers give you homework you can do it in the class, and I like it because you can have more time to stay with your friends. By this I mean, when I come back to my home I dont have to do any homework because I do my homework in the school and I can go outside and play with my friends. This is why is good to have more hours of school. For example, one day I was in the school, and my science teacher give me so much homework, she told me I need to do projects, quizzes, and extra work but I told her I cant do it because I dont have internet at home and I cant do my homework in the school because I dont have so much time because the school end early. I go to the school principal and I asked him if he can extend the school day because many students need more time to do their homework and then a few week ago he told me,"" I want to expend the school days because I was thinking and you are right."" I feel happy in that moment because I will have more time to do my homework and pass the grade. Conclusion, extending the school hour can help you to do your homework and missing work, and you dont need to do it at home. My second reason is I like to have school hours because you have more time to eat and when you do your testes you can study one hour and not is a matter because you still have time to do your test. By this I mean I have more time to eat my lunch and talk with my friends in the cafeteria, and when I have testes I do it with more calm, and I dont stressful because I have time to do my test. To illustrate, I was in the school, and I was doing my math test and I was so hungry and I asked my teacher if I can ate and he said "" No because we dont have a lot of time, and we need to finish the test."" I was so mad because I was hungry, and we dont have time to ate. When the test finished we go to ate and then we have to go to another class but I was so tired because them dont give us time to rest . To wrap up, you need to have time for everything and do the thing with calm. Is good if the school extend the school hours because you have time for do your homework, your quizzes, or your projects. To wrap up, the school need to extend the school day because like this every student will have time to do what they need to do in their classes, and they dont have to worry about the homework in their houses. I feel if the school extend the hours should be great and more peaceful because you can because you can do your work and other things with more tranquility. I think if in your school extend the school hours you have more time to do your homework, and you can have more time to stay with your family.",6,7,6,7,6,8,905,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

They think everyone is going to make fun of them which never happens. Some disable person cannot come to school , who cannot walk, so they have advantage to attend online classes from home. For example, disable student who dont want to go to school and study just because of their disability. Nobody can force them what to do. They dont have to go anywhere. They have one advantage to take online or video conferencing classes to compete with others. It will give them more confidence in life.

It is important for students to eat foods they like because it brightens up their day. Many people believe that having a healthier school menu is a good idea because it lets students become healthy. The cafeteria should not change their lunch menu to a healthier school menu. It effects the students learning if they are not happy with their food, their parents pay for students school lunch, also students wont be used to the new healthier menu. Students learning would be effected if they are not happy with their food. Students need food that they enjoy to motivate themselves. Students cant learn if they arent treated with right food. If the cafeteria is not serving good menus, students will have a bad mood. It is important to give and treat students good food so that they will like being at school. Parents arent just paying their kids school for nothing. Parents are paying for their childs school lunch to make them enjoy themselves at school and to learn. Students will be social if they are having a good meal at lunch. Students will also be active if they are getting the right food. Therefore it is important that the school needs to think about the students health. Students would not be used to the new healthier menu, they would hate it. They will bring their own lunch because students dont like eating the school meals. It will also make parents stop paying for their childs school lunch. When most of students arent eating the school food, other students will follow their footsteps. Moreover it is important to not change the schools menu because they wont get used to it. A new healthier menu will effect students learning in school, they would not get used to the menu, and parents wont be paying the school for their childs lunch. Students will bring their own lunch to school. Students will not be active and social in school. Essentially it is very important that the school should stick with the same menu at all means.

717,3067,F29244150DCB,"Schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by video conference. This might be a good option for students who really do need it but there is some other students who wont take this seriously. I am writing this essay with the porpuse of desagreement with the idea of providing this ""benefit"" to the students, this is a way of making students lose interest in school because they might think that they dont have to take the conference every time and they willl think that they can do it whenever they want which gives to think that they arent prepare for making good decisions when it comes with schools classes. In my opinion this is an opportunity that the schools gives to the students to drop out of high school considering that students are teenagers and they dont have the same amount of responsability than adults in most cases. As a student I desagree with this option. We need to be able to communicate, create good group work, and meet people and I can assure that most of the students will ended up leaving this classes when they half way done. Being with more students make classes fun, helpful and even more interesting, students sometimes needs to have a adult teaching them and having a conversation face to face instead a computer taking to them. Taking classes online is a benefit when you know how to manage time for example: My brother is a college student who is getting his master degree in Genetic Engineering some of his classes wasnt a requirement that he had to take them inside school so he decide to take them online so he can have more free time when it comes with work and school. He made a study plan which consist in spending one hour each day so he can focus on his online classes which helps him to study for every single of his classes. My friend Generic_Name is a senior on high school and she decided to take two of her classes online so she can have enough time for work, school activities, and graduation plans. She has been overwhelm with all her activities and assignments which it made her drop out of one of her two online classes, she said she felt like she couldnt do it by herself which it made her start getting bad grades in her school classes. Later she decided to take those classes in school so she can have her classmate help her in case she get stuck in a topic. I think this opportunity can make students get stuck and give up on school which it cant happen because we are the future. In conclusion this option has it advantages and disavantages which for some people might seems good and differentes but for some other this option seems to be useless when it comes with the progress that we do inside the school.",8,7,7,8,6,7,3592,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

So the city council should take step forward in to adopting the curfew law, because that would keep the teenagers out of trouble. Many teenagers follow the law, but those who do not will be breaking the law. This curfew law is going to help many ways, some teenagers stay out late socializing with they are friend; many times they are late to school the next morning. The benefits of this law would be that, it keeps the teenagers safe and out of trouble. If the curfew is adopted, it is going to keep the teenagers out of streets late at night. Me and my friend sometime go to 7-eleven late at night during weekdays around 10;30 p. m. If the law was in order right now, we would be breaking the law. On the weekend some teenagers might want to stay out longer with they are friends: socializing, making new friends, and building a good friendship. But a law is a law, If you are still out on the streets after 12 a. m then you would be breaking the law and going to be in trouble. This curfew law will set a boundary for teenagers who always come home late at night. This law might cut down little bit of they are freedom, but it is for they are own good. My mom always tells me to be home by 9:00 p. m on the weekdays, but I am always an hour late. When the curfew law is in order, my mom knows that i will be home by 10 p. m, because i do not like to break the law. It is better to be safe and out of trouble than getting in trouble and breaking the law. Many people would disagree with the curfew law because some teenagers work and do not have transportation; they have to walk from work to home after those hours. There-for it is parents job to make sure they are kids make it home safe. As parents you never want to see your child in danger or in trouble on the streets.

719,1471,63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things. Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day. If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday. Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage. Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow. The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",5,6,8,7,6,6,1297,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between 5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life.

Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls dont want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when theyre pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because theyre to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes. For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they dont have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",6,5,5,4,4,4,613,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Positive attitude is the identification of our self to the world. ",7,7,6,7,6,7,3484,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
726,984,77D210B9EC7E,"Students will benefit from being able to do the classes from home because maybe they have reason to do there or having some problems because some people doesnt like the community or having to many people around them. If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people. These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home. The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they dont like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesnt want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they dont want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them. The second reason is maybe other students dont like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students dont want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school. Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they dont need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people dont think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them. In conclusion is that if people choose the online classes and doing at their home they are free to choose because they equal are going to study but at their home they have reason to do there. But i will say that people dont need to care what other people is saying to them.",7,7,5,7,6,6,1564,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 5, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
727,2784,DBDE16551908,"I think the best way is to work as a group. You might ask why. is the best way students get to learn, For example; Im the type of student that like to hear about peoples opinion. By listining to other people opinin give the other student a idea on how the project or the assigment should be done. When student get the chance to express they idea they feel confident no fear to express themselve. Many students like to work bby themselve, therefore no other student interrupt the by asking to many question. Most of them already have a topic to talk about they already have a plan. For Example student that work alone they mostly working at their own pace, working alone give then the chance of finishing on time. Working as a group give the student the chance of dividing the work in different sections, For example; this student would do this part, the pther student would design the project, the other student would do the research. Dividing the project in different part let the student look or choose the part the thing is easy to do ot they know how to do it already. Student get to meet new people, by doing a project like a group student somtime dont get to choose who they work with, The profesor might give the students a group of people they never meet before. working as a group with new people let you find a new ways to work or write. For example you meet this new student who make a T chart and write the good about this topic and the negative side about the topic next to it. After looking at it he decide what side he should talk about. You get things done a lot faster by doing in groups as I said before working with a group let the work get done a lot faster, its give the people the chance of focusing and the part they have to get done. If you finish your part of the project or assigment, you can volunteer to help other team mate. For example someone that works by themselve might need more time, because shes working by her self and you get the chance to volunteer to help her out on something, she might found difficult to do. In my conclusion, working like a group it teach the students to listen to other peoples thoughts and, its the best way students work as one. But other peolpe would say that working alone is the best choice, because it teach the student how to make decision on their own and how they should write their own paper with anybody helping them out.

728,1989,D159EE3218BC,"Showing kindness to others is very important because people see you that you have a kind soul, people can spread kindness around the world, and kindness will help you throughout your future. Kindness is the key for success and enjoying your life. The world would not been the same if their were not any kindness, imagine what it would be like if no one knew what kindness is. Having kindness in your blood could change your future to an even better one. Having no kindness means that you are negative and misrable but all that could change when a person shows you how kindness could change your personality. When people see you showing kindness, that shows that you have a good heart and a good soul. And, it also shows that you care and very nice so, people could trust you. Thinking kindness is very positive and relaxing because it is a very good thing to do in life. Kindness will never be a bad thing because it is meant to change the future. No matter what, kindness could never go wrong as long as you try it to others. Spreading kindness around the world could change how people think, in terms of doing something bad is not part of kindness. Therefore, giving kindness to a person could spread around the world, and you would not even know that all this kindness was because of you. Without kindness, all the virture words would not even exsist. There would be no such things as being caring, loving, sharing, humble, and so much more. Every small kindness you show to others, will change their emotion and follow your action as they did to you. Kindness will really help you in the future because it shows you who you truly are. If you show kindness everywhere then their could be a chance for you to get into jobs easily or, for you to get good grades on your school work. Also, in the future you would be very grateful that kindness brought you here into this amazing life, and all the kindness you have done in your previous years. Kindness is always by your side. You will appreciate having kindness in your life because it helps you to become a better person. Kindness will not randomly appear to you, you just need to make and share kindness. Life is waiting patiently for the people to spread kindness everywhere but, unfortunatly some people would not let that happen. In our expectation people should already have kindness for, in reality thousands of people do not want to share their kindness. Some people are trying to spread kindness because they want the world to be a good place for the future.

I disagree with this statement all students need four years in high school for know what to do in the future and they do not have any problem in college Students graduate in three years is not good because in four years you can learn more about that career you prefer to be in the future, you can take more opportunities for to be successful people think that is good because you can graduate one year early but some times is much better continues in high school for prepare yourself. in four years you take more classes and learning about it. For example student wants to graduate and wants to be a mechanic he needs to keep going in high school for four years he learn about that career he wants and another subjects. Some people they do not like the idea for to graduate early because they do not think that is prepare for to go to college. College is a serious thing so all people need to prepare for to go there ,when you go to the college you have a idea that difficult be for you but not impossible . you need to pass all your classes in college but for that you need to study and try your best in high school that is the way for a good student . Some people prefer graduate one year early , they has reasons, they wants to finish the career for to help the family or some people just finish the high school and go to work. is probably is the bigger reason why some people choose that opinion. for me both reason is good because you need to stay in school for to be successful and understand why some persons wants to graduate early they wants to help his/her family so both options that is very good. Four years in high school is the bets option can you choose because you learn more, study more, and prepare more , for me that is the good way for to successful in life. Probably be more hard but you can do it, you need to try the best do yo have for in the future you will be a good person with a good job and can help your family. when help your family you are a good person and recognize that job was your parents did for you so keep going and do it a 4 years in high school this is good for success in life .",5,5,6,4,6,6,1706,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. They want to make sure you have the classes you need in order to acheive your career . The career that you will be giving to the counsouler will be befetional. After the graduation you will easily take the classes that you wanted. firstly, I think it is good idea to identify your career before entering to high school. When you submitting your application to the high school, they will look at the classes that you need to graduate. If you plan your career from a young age, you will achieve your career very strong and easily. In order to have a successful life you need a good career. The plan which you Will be thinking , or taking will show a how organize you are. secondly,Try to talk with someone who have experiences in this types of problems. When you talk to someone they will be giving you some advises to help you during your high school time. For example: When you want to take the classes you need to take , or you have to take, but they give you useless classes you do not need for graduation. If you want to go to a law school, then you need to take social study ,or government but when you do not commit your plan of career they will give some useless classes like Photography, Independent living and Art which you do not need for law school. Thirdly,It is very important to have a good education in this day and age. You do not need to waste time of your life in classes you do not need. We have to try our best to be organized.

731,2625,E3D9EE7C68F1,"Have you ever wonder how many enjoyable activities are outside of the world? Theyre thousands of enjoyable activities outside the world. Most people like to spend time with their families outdoors such as going to community parks, state parks, and national parks. Not everyone likes to go outside to spend time with their family, or go to a place to have fun because they dont like to go outside that much, but most of the times you need to go and look around whats around the world. I would prefer someone should go to and spend time with their family, or just to have fun such as going to the zoo, going to Disney or travel to a different state where you live. The first reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to the zoo. Most zoos can be a little boring, but you can find a way to have lots of fun. The zoo can bring you lots of fun, and enjoyment such as taking pictures with the animals, giving the animals their food, and touching and giving love to the animals that are in the zoo. For example, at the zoo you can learn some interesting facts about every kind of animal that are you very interest in. Also, giving lots of love to the animals like talking to them or touching them is a way to be relax. You can learn new things about animals and the history, and it can be interesting and fun at the same time. In my opinion, the zoo is a great place and a great activity to have fun. The second reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go to like a Disney park. A large of number of people that I have known go to Disney to have fun with their family members. For example, at a Disney park you can go and try different games there, eat some different type of food that you havent tried yet, and go and take picture of princesses that you really want to meet. For example, if you watch Disney princesses, you can go and meet them in real life, and talk to them. Also, going to Disney and trying games or riding any type of game is going to bring you enjoyment. It will take you the stress that you have, and you will forget everything that you been going through. In my opinion, Disney is the second best place to go and have fun by yourself or with the people that is around you. The third reason, why someone should go and have fun is to go and travel to a different state, or country that they have never been to. For example, going to the Bahamas is a great place to go, looking at museums of what had happened in that place. Also, going to the beach in the Bahamas is another way to have fun, the beach is going to relax you in a type of way that you will not imagine. Exploring the world, or trying new things from a different state or country is a type of having fun, You can got to different parks, different beaches, and different restaurants where you can try different type of foods that you havent even tried and that are the bets. In my opinion, going to different countries, or different states that you have never been is the third reason why its a great idea to go and have lots of fun. Many people like to have fun in different ways not just being outside. Most people like to spend time alone or with their family members. Theres different types of way to have fun at different places not only going to the zoo, going to Disney a park, or going to a place that you have never been or explore what is it like to be in another country. Find a way to have some fun outdoors and all the things that keeps you stress are going get away in a second. Spending time in something that you really love is a great feeling that you will have experience in your life. Have fun with all the people that you love and that is around you because spending time with them and going to parks with them is the best feeling that you ever will ever have.

732,1322,ED937FC56246,"The one thing I hope I accomplish is to get a high paying job. I would want a high paying job since it could pay off many things that I dont need to pay later. My reasons is to travel to many places Ive never been to, buy many things as I want without spending my family moneys, and I would try many different foods that could be expensive. One reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that I never been to. Traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or dont need. Sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. Having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. I think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything youve ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money. The next reason is to buy many things as I want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. This is important because it wouldnt matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on. Another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. When you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. Another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money. The last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. From my experiences I know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. I also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. Sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people wouldve gone crazy. Paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad. In conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places youve never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. Going to places you have never been to is great. Spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. Also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it.

733,806,3550660EE2EC,A enjoyable educational activity is when I was doing a science experiment wewas building a volcano. It irupted we was all smiling because we didnt know it was gonna work. we put soda inside the volcanoe and we shaked it a little and then put mentos it went high. we had to clean it up after there was a mess every where but it was fun. As soon as everybody left I was taking to the teacher to ask her wat I got. He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how and he told me that there was soda every where. it was messy and it had mentos in it and I was like please give me an A or can i at least remake it. He was like you can have one more chance to remake it I was all like thank you. it took me a while to make it and think what I can do so it wont spill anywhere. So I thought of putting a cone around the volcano put I was all like nah because whats the whole point of putting it if you cant see it. I got an idea I put a lighter in side and a put a special paint that blows up with just fire. it can not make a mess I dont have to clean the floor I think this the best idea. i did it and i tryed it out at my house and it always blew up every where and I kept on thinking and thinking but I had no idea Ithought that it had to much paint and iI kep on putting it little by little. It kinda worked if I put a little in a bootle and light it like that but thene I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it and it did and then i kept putting more and more news paper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it it was hard because i didnt know which way to put it. I got it all finished and I took it to school. It was my turn i represented the volcano I lit it on fire and the whole volcano fell and I was mad. after school the teacher called me and told me.you did a great job but it failed but guess what you get an A for at least trying I was so happy I didnt belive it I did it.,5,5,6,6,5,5,693,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

736,2007,06F5F6A09DC6,"More than one persons advice Have you ever wondered or questioned yourself why do you have to ask more than one persons for advice? Yep you heard me. People from all around the world ask advice about anything. That could be video games, schools, and even Life. Obviously, there are many other things to ask advice. Its kind of asking for help, you can say. People incuding kids, teens, and even adults are asking advice that could help them in the furture, you guys even might have connections, and more than one person. More than one is better than just asking for one persons advice. Having connections The people you ask for advice were kids too just like you and they possibly ran into what you are stuck or struggling at right now. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. Thats either with struggles at school, home, family members, or even life. I almost forgot to include decisions because small decisions can eventually become big decisions. I recommand you to ask adults more than anyone else. I mean you can ask seniors but they most likely will forget everything since they were kids. The worst thing you can do is asking someone young even a 18 year old adult because you never know what happened in them. Trust and worthy friends you can ask but friends that you just say hi to once a day or even a week wouldnt be so great. Help in the future Advices not just help from the presents but in the future as well. According to my calculations you could use that advice over and over again. For example, lets say you didnt know where you put a comma in a sentence, therefore, you used a persons advice and it was to put a and where ever you were going to put the comma at. You can also use it to help your kids and even grandsons if you still remember. More than one persons advice Last but not least, why more than one persons advice you ask. One advice can help and even solve whatever you have in mind but you actually want to check if they were right. You probably want to gather the information and rethink it. Everyone in my opinion should at most ask two people for advice just to make sure. First person person wasnt being that specific enough so you decide to go to another person. If they havent been specific enough then just go to another person. I mean how hard is that? Especially kids since they have just started growing up and will soon become young adults. Everybody should be struggling something in a certain time of life that they ask for advice. Dont be shy for asking advice and you believe in yourself that you are a brave and confedent man that doesnt need help. Because really you will be a better one for asking advice.

For an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where youll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. You apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that theyll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits. Another reason , Your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. Your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. If your loyal to someone chances are theyll be loyal to you. For an example a Hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. Respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what theyll do if you disrespect them. You want to always respect someone. Your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and youll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. The world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. You choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. Your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. They shouldnt have to choose your attitude. Even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , I think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice. We control what goes through our head and what comes out of our mouths. The people around us should respect our character. We decided what we want to do for ourselves not others.

740,2455,82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling. Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people dont finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they cant reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country. Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there were more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand. Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldnt say a word because I didnt know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we were just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came. Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. ",6,7,8,7,7,7,1725,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Attend to classse is great is a oction from student to choose but is the smart oction for for student who know what they want to do in they future.

( I have one idea in how they can do this in ah good way. The students ho miss the school need to call the school and inform why they not going to the school and need the have a parent in his house, then they send them the link of the online class and notify the parent if they are doing work, oh they are skiping the online classes, and they can have ah limet time of online classes so they can be focus to his work and doit on time and when they are doing ah test they doing the test in a video coferincing with one teacher if they and not chating oh copy during the test. ).

My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed. To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we dont talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you havent been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. Its important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so thats why you should go outside and play with your friends. In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesnt give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldnt focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didnt have any stress after in 2016. its important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so thats the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends. In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesnt give you any bad day or anything like obviously you dont want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

To get school diploma students will have to accomplish some classes like music,drama,or an art class. they should use those classes for distraction their mind to the other classes for examples math, history and science class then, they will get relaxation. Also, I think that some people wants the students take those classes because those classes represent happiness, peace and an individual talent that every person have. but some people get frustrated that they don not have any talent like sing, act or draw. Some people want that the students take those classes because they need to develop their mind in something productive for the society and for them. No think in bad things or bad actions. Also,I think that some people think that students should be take a music,drama,or art class because students have the potential to protrude in the great music,drama and art world. To prove to the society the capacity that they may have and that they are the future. They will replace the people that do music drama and art in our present for example artists,painters and others. I think that some people believe that students should be take music,drama and art classes because is the only way to develop their mind,knowledge and to learn new things that help them for the future. Those classes help the students to get a mental and physical develop because the music make us to express feelings,emotions,or give to the audience a message that we want that they know and understand. The drama help us to develop our mind,but also,help us to use our body to express something that we want that people will know. The art class help us to represent,express and get abilities that students will do not know that they have. With those classes students will be exactly what they are and feel because they will express anything that they may want without get frustrated. In conclusion some people believes that students should be take music,drama,an art class because they need new persons that express and give to them that knowledge that represent those classes because those students that will learn are the future and are the new generation. Also, because students need express feelings,emotions and develop their knowledge.

750,63,FA2DE7E82907,"Its has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. Keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. True self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success. Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam. Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for. Student learn for their mistakes its much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that dont show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because its better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn. while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and its better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesnt mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem.",5,5,5,6,5,7,3773,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
751,1726,E88DDF2C81EB,I believe that positive attitude is the key to success in life. What I mean by that is being nice and giving a good feedback to the things and actions people do and say. We can show how matured we are. We can be examples for others that are living with us too. I have a friend and her name is Generic_Name. She plays a lot of sport and one of the sport she plays was soccer. Generic_Names team always losses and she use to tell her team that it will be fine and that they just need more practice. The next Saturday they are having a game. All her team mates are scared because they are positive that they are gone be losing with out even being at the game. Generic_Name told them losing is not the end of the world and being scared does not help them to wine the game. At the end they all promised to each other even if they dont wine that they will be happy to be able to play. On the other side there is my little brother Generic_Name. He is 12 years old. He never liked math. I always try to help him do his home work. One day I saw his test and he had them all right. I was not surprised because he was working so hard. Whenever he gets his answers wrong he wold say that its fine. I will do it again. After he came home he said his teacher gave him candy and that he gave it to his friend. I was so amazed. I couldnt wait to ask why. He said because his friend was studying so hard and did not get any candy he felt bad. over all positive attitude is the key to success. Whenever we dont fell like we are having negative energy we should ask and understand that it could get worse. By positive altitude we could get more that we lose if we are having negative attitude.,7,7,7,7,7,6,3370,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

753,494,C15EC5707409,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools. In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldnt keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school. Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks. Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year. In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. Students will be very streful and tired during class. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades.

Therefore the harder they work,the more they achieve. their self-esteem will keep rising and then they start believing in themselves more. Also other believe that praises for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. I agree with there opinion,I believe that there should be goals to reach and you must try your hardest to achieve. Theirs always the chance the chance of failing but that just means to keep pushing, to fix the mistakes. And when you finally achieve your goal it makes you feel so much better about yourself. Also that builds you up for harder task. Therefore some believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. which I believe in too,feeling better about yourself works more when you have earned something. Also it can be anything but as long you give it your all,and achieve what is meant to be achieve. Your self-esteem is going to be built up knowing that you achieve something. Next I dont believe in just praising someone no matter how good the job was works like that. Because you keep praising that they could do so much better on,its just going to make the feel like they already got the job done,when they can do so much better. Praise their work when they tired there hardest,so then they can keep trying there hardest to achieve goals no matter what. Thats how i believe that praising should be done and how to build self-esteem to make whoever try to best on anything, to not give just half but to give there all. Finally does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement? Its come from earning achievement,so they know they give it everything they had to earn that achievement. praises work when you praise there best work so they can keep on trying there best on everything.

I think soccer is a fun activity to play, because you can learn how to work in teams . In my opinion it helps you improve your friendly skills. Soccer helps you on how to work in teams. Ive seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they dont get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team. Also, when you play soccer you have to think what youre going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills.

757,160,EFBF293CC2AF,"Dear, Local hospital manager I would love to visit your hospital because i can imagine my self walking through those doors, smelling medicine and noticing the sound of machines, seeing surgents running and rushing towards the surgery room, soon to save a humans life. I wanna visit your hospital because i think its pretty cool and brave what you guys do. One reason why i would love to visit your hospital would be because i think that the hospital is a very cool place, surgents get the feeling when they save someones life and they get to use some cool machines that they probably havent used until they started to working in the hospital and they get to open up people and see the inside of a persons body. One other reason why i think its pretty cool, is that there is three different types of doctors, the first kind of doctor would be an Intern, which is a doctor that just started there first year as one and that is learning to be the best, another kind is a mid tern resident, which is the second to highest level, one last kind of doctor is the highest which is a resident,i think its smart that you guys have that because i think it keeps everything organized and it keeps every doctor in order. One example why i want to visit the hospital is that i want to make people that they are in good hands, that they are going to be safe, also i wanna become one of the best surgents out there, most of all i just wanna help and save lives, i think its cool that surgents get to use machines and other tools to open up people that need medical help. When i was smaller i would have to take care of my sister because my mom would be busy going to work, one day my sister got cut when she was playing outside she was bleeding a lot that i grabbed some paper and rolled it around her leg and then called my mom because it seem so deep, ever since that day i wanted to be a surgent because i didnt feel disgusted by the blood and stuff, i thought it was pretty cool that i cured her leg, and stopped it bleeding. I wanna have the opportunity to visit your hospital because i wanna save peoples lives when i grow up and have that desperate feeling when you save someones life. One reason why i want to have that feeling is because, i just wanna save peoples life and make them better, even though it might get exhausted its gonna be worth it because at the end of the day i think of how i saved someones life. Another reason is because i wanna see how the hospital works and how every gets in managed, i want to learn if there is anymore different kind of doctors for example, there is cardio heart surgery, plastic surgery and more, i wanna be a surgent when i grow up because i wanna save peoples lives, i feel like there is so much good around the world that i wanna do good when i grow up. One example is that, me being a surgent would be a good idea because i can learn and help people that are struggling in life,i wouldnt just get to help people lives inside the building, i would get to save someones life outdoor of the building too because if something happens to someone then i can help them, if i become a surgent then im gonna work hard and learn about medicine to be the best and help anyone that comes through those doors. I wanna become into a doctor/surgent because i just started watching this show and its very interesting because its about doctors saving other peoples lives and how they struggle and how that connects with there life because they feel like they havent been spending time with there friends or there family because they just have been busy of work and i feel like ive been learning on how i can not struggle in life if i do work as a surgent. I wanna visit the hospital because when i grow up i wanna become into a surgent and learn about all the medicine out there. One reason why you should let us visit the hospital would be because i wanna get the opportunity to feel to be a surgent one day and learn about everything. Another reason why you should let us visit is because if some kids are interested into becoming into a surgent then they can think of taking a medicine class in high school and learn about it more so they can prepare them self if they become into a doctor or surgent, being a surgent isnt just about opening people up and sowing them and saving peoples lives, its about learning and learning because every time you do something you have never done before in your life, you have just learned something and by getting the opportunity of just going to see the hospital and seeing how it works, i just have learned something new even though i didnt do anything other than watching. One example why you should let us visit is because we would be learning something new and getting to feel how everything works around the hospital if we were to work as a surgent or doctor. I mostly wanna become into a doctor because i think its cool how doctors are brave and work and how good they are at there jobs, mostly its cool because they learn something new everyday and at the end of the day they have saved a lot of peoples lives or changed peoples lives. A local company i would love to visit is the hospital because i feel like the hospital is very cool, the feeling of saving someones life is incredible, and you get to learn everything about medicine/medical stuff. I think working at a hospital is a gift because you get to learn and everything and save peoples lives and most of all you learn.

Because I like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities. The fun games could help someone feel relaxed and forget about something that might be worrying them. another reason why I like that is because l think it is much more fun than having to be in health, Doing the pacer or doing push ups.

I like going outside because I like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. It is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football.

761,471,6751442A85E4,"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someones help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life. Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when youre angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. Thats the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you dont want to end up one day behind bars. Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, its most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friends trophies. I was so mad that I wasnt thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasnt right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes its better to make the right choices because it releases our stress. Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but its the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life. Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. ",8,9,8,8,8,9,1343,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if students know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career.

An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that dont get to finish their homework or dont understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that dont have time to do things after school. An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People dont always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they dont have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that dont have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish. I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I dont have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might dont have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it wont starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club. Most of the students wont have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I dont think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I dont think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework. It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that dont have time after school wont struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that.

767,3001,72732FD01203,"""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". In my opinion, I agree with this quote because, if you do not try to do better everyday, you are not going to reach your purpose. When you have the experience, on doing something you have to keep doing it, and you will improve each day. If you keep working on something that you have already work on it, and you dont stop focused on, it will make you grow. The more things you learn the more prepared you will be in your life. My first reason that support my response, is that if you dont keep trying to do better everyday, you are not going to complete your goal. If you keep trying your best and doing what you like to do you will grow each day. Its important that you try your best everyday not only you will grow in your life but you are going to make yourself proud as well. For example, some people have their goals but they dont try their best. My second reason that support my response is that when you have the experience on doing something you most keep doing it, and you will improve each day. Every time you try to improve, its a good opportunity for you to grow. The experience you have will make your future better. If you work on something that you have already work on it, and you dont stop focused on it will make your life easier. The more you work on something the fastest you will see the different in your life. For example, in my experience every time I know how to do something and I keep practicing, on it I get to improve myself. My third reason that support my response is that the more things you learn the more prepared your will be in your life. If you try to learn more things and not just stay focused in just one thing will make you to be able to grow. Everyday you most have the purpose of learning new things. Learning new things each day, makes a person specialized and all the things you know. For example, in my experience when I try to learn more about something, its easier for me to talk about it. To conclude, I agree with the author Ralph Waldo Emersons statement. The more you know about something, the best future you will have. If you focused on doing good everyday you will grow. Trying to do something you have experience with will make you grow. Working on your purpose will make you have a better life.",8,7,6,6,6,7,1482,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
768,841,A91103F63B19,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". We tend to persevere when we are used to doing something for a long time but if you dont do anything how will u accomplish and persevere in anything? However been idle doesnt necessarily mean we are incapable of persevering forward, it just means that we lack the spirit to accomplish our goals or dreams. Your inactivity in life doesnt serve a purpose at all in your life instead it serves as your downfall and your weakness in persevering. People who persevere to accomplish their goals or dreams always end up changing their lives for the better instead of the worst. Like Lionel Messi he didnt give up on his dreams to become a world star athlete because he couldnt walk upright and was always bending over, he continued playing despite been different from everyone else he played with. He played and showed how energetic he was in accomplishing his dream of becoming a world class soccer player. And today hes one of the worlds Best and richest soccer players in the world today. He showed that even if you have tried and cant persevere through your goals or dreams, the little effort you put in can do a drastic change in your life. Its amazing to see how much we have done in te last two hundred years pertaining to technology. We didnt do all that by standing around and been idle but by always pesevering to accomplis something greater for ourselves and our society and to move forward. we have created electricity, telephones, telegraph, airplane, motorcycle, automobile and more. we created so much that it pushes us forward to be better people. But the most important one we discovered was electricity because more than half of what we use today uses some form of electricity. We have created so much that people would not be idle but there are still idle people. Not everyone who perseveres comes from a poor family or had a terrible life when they were little or was disabled, people can persevere where ever they are from. They can persevere even if they look, talk or act different from everyone else as long as they have a strong spirit and a strong will to move ahead and be a better person than they were before nothing can stop them. So let us all be persevering and be able to accomplish our goals by doing somthing good for ourselves.",8,7,8,7,7,8,2258,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

770,2721,C7CE778367F6,""" Why stay home bored out of your mind when there are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors? "" I think outdoors activities are more enjoyable then indoors activities because you can spend more time with family, spending more time exploring the world, and take time away from all those electronic devices. Being outdoors provides a wide variety of interesting ways to enjoy being outdoors for example going to the park where there awesome activities for the kids and parents, taking a stroll outside with you dog or family, and it can also be a stress reliever. First, Family is important, and spending more time with family is important, because it allow you to get to know them. For example your mom and dad work really hard to affords all the stuff you need and you and your brothers and sisters are barely able to see them. On Saturdays and Sundays are the only time your able to see them and have quality time with them but you are to busy in your room chatting with friends a d doing your homework, but all you have to do is take a break and spend time with them. Going to the park with them , walking around, talking have a nice conversation without a rush, joking around are ways you can spend time with family. Having fun at a carnival or festival with your family, eating hot dogs, cotton candy , riding fun rides, you might even find your cousins there and also spend time with them. All of these are enjoyable ways you can spend with your family outdoors. Secondly, spending more time with the outside world is an amazing experiences because it allows you to discover all the amazing living creatures, food, cultures, countries , other ways other people live, etc. It can be very enjoyable to explore for example you can go to South Africa there are amazing food, animals if you go to the zoo its amazing, and fun to do with family or friends or even alone. Exploring can also be fun you can go out meet people you can go to book fairs, concert from your favorite bands or singers, try out different restaurant, try something crazy like jumping from a cliff and going into the river, swimming with sharks or dolphins, you can meet people who might be with you your whole entire life, have connections with them, visiting a museum, a aquarium. There are fun ways you can explore the world with all these outdoors activities. Thirdly, spending time away from electronics helps enjoys quality times with other for examples your family, friends,and it helps be more focus in school and homework. Humans have tendency to procrastinate and be like "" oh im going to do my homework and this or that tomorrow I have so much stuff to do"" but at the same time stay on there phone for hours. Some people cant even have a decent conversation with family or spend time outdoors with their brothers and sister because they are too busy on their phone for hours. Parks, museums, and other places have good outdoors activities that helps humans stay away from technologies. There and millions of ways you can enjoy outdoors activities without being on your devices. In conclusion, going to the park with your family and spending time together, visiting different countries, taking time away from your phone, and enjoying all the beautiful things this earth has, are enjoyable ways you can spend outdoors, all of the activities can also be a stress reliever, going to the park with your cousin and sibling are fun to do and are enjoyable time outside .",7,6,6,6,6,6,2716,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

773,2033,D1D770AF6855,"I believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms because , If someone needs to call you , family emergency , and it could also be used as learning tool. Although sometimes cell phones in school might be used for personal reasons like soical media the pros of being able to use your cell phones in school outweigh the cons. In todays current society millions of people use electronic devices at work and school , Schools should implement more use out of technology and let kids use their phones in class to help complete tasks assigned to them , for example , If a kid does not want to use a dictionary and to find a word he can easily just look up the words meaning on he internet using his phone. If someone needs to call you during school they can easily do it by just dialing up your number instead of having to call the school. It is much easier to call someone during school on there celluar device instead of having to call the school wait for the school to find the classroom the student is in and then transfer the call to the student in that classroom. In case of a family emergency , parents , relatives will call you on your phone most likely they will not call the school. I have had personal experiences with that as my parents do not contact the school when they wish to speak to me , they call me on my cell phone. Implementing better rules in school for cellphone usage is beneficial , instead of punishing a student for having there phone out in the classroom the school should make better use out of cellphones by allowing students to have them out and or use them. More schools , classes are making it easier to access assignments that can be completed online , you can view what assignments you have to complete in class by using your cellphone instead of being overwhelmed with paperwork , your tasks can be completed online. I believe schools should allow cellphones in classrooms , it will make learning in class easier due to the easy access of the internet , in case of family emergencys and for any other reason you might need it.

774,1766,5DEDECE96044,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose. cellphones has become the major problem in schools for students and for teachers. I think that cellphones should not be allowed in the classroom because students dont do the work that they suposted be doing and schools already have tecnology to use. Cellphones shouldnt be allowed for educacional purpose because students dont do that work that they suposted be doing. Sometimes students take pictures of homework or a test and then they pass it to a friend. They always wants to check theirs social media like snapchat or instagram. this in one reason why students fail classes or fail grades. For example, in my English class there is a guy who is always using his phone, checking his social media or checking his messages that his friends has be sending to him and he is not passing his classes. Also, cellphones shouldnt be allowed for educational purpose because schools already have tecnology for students can use. The government gives the schools computers because they wants the students graduate and dont have any distraction by using theirs cellphones. schools have computers or ipads and thas why teacher dont need to let the students use their phone to do any work that they have to do. However, Students can do their work in the computer where the teacher can be checking what the students is doing, if his doing his work or not. Some students might say that they can use their cellphones in the classroom because it is more easy for them to translate words than be looking words in the dictionary. Also, some students might say that they cant live with out using their phone. Finally, they might say that using theirs phone can be more easy because they can be checking their work any time that they want.

So i think the students should have a community service. The principal should required the students to have a community service. If students would decide to have community service they would do a awesome job by helping out residents and helping out the environment because your helping it out by not letting that much trash get in to our world. You would help the plants by letting them grow more and live more. Then will have much more food and vegetables. So i think having a community service is good so will help out the environment to stay clean and have a better and cleaner community.

Thomas Jefferson wrote that determine never to be idle which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth.

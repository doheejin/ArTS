0,782,4F7F24918F42,"As a student myself, I think students would benefit from attending classes from home, because attending classes can help students manage their own time and learn how to self control, and can follow their own pace of learning. As day by day passes, I believe that lots of students are sick of repeating the same dull sketchual, and wish they could stay at home for school, on the other hand, they will not have to wake up so early everyday when they worked on their homework till so late. When students attend classes from home, they will be able to manage their own sketchual, learn how to control their time efficiently, be more self-reliance, and prepare for the future. In conclusion, it is a benefit for students to attend classes from home, because they can learn how to make their own plan, and learn how to manage time, which I believe that it will help the students a lot in their jobs, future life goals or even their entire life.",8,9,9,9,9,9,1041,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

2,784,66133AC6189A,"On my experiences I think It would be impossible to change the first impressions becuase one different people have different types of characteristics traits. For example one of my friend who move to text,her characteristic traits I remember she was so nice to everybody when she use to live her in virginia and also she use to get along with everbody at the school. This shows that type of impressions that my friend Generic_Name has. Another example is when I was in lunch line with my friend Generic_Name,a spanish girl touch my hair,I did not know that girl was the girlfriend of the boy that was in one of my class. Until then when I was going to my third class I ask that boy if he could help me find this class because I did not know where all my classes were,when he came up to me to explain the schuedule and told me and him had the same class,his girlfriend look at me mad. This shows that at first the girl of the boy was nice and then the girl of the boy was kind of mean to mean.

3,785,7ACF284A8B7C,"I think that work in groups is more benefit. Because work is groups make the class successful. also, the students can know each other and they can meet new people. therefore, work in groups is benefit for students and teacher. Here are some reason why I think that work in groups is benefit. First, They can divide the work in same parts. While someone is working in searching information the other one can think in how to make the work more creative. Also, if they divide the work is more fair for the group so they can have more opportunity to work successfully. Second, They have more opportunity to have a better work. If the class work in group they can do much better in the work that working alone because they can do the work more easily by working as a team. For example, If the class works in groups of 4 they can do a good work by dividing the work in same parts like one can be searching for information the other one can be looking for imagines. The other two can be checking that the writing is good and that the information is good. And the last one can make the presentation and make the work creative. Second, In groups can take less time to work on it that working alone. If a group meet in one place and they start working they can easily finish the work on time. Also, they can search for information more faster then alone because they can divide the work but they can also help each other. Second, In a group decide what to do it can be hard. But when the group decide what to do and they finish the work fast. The group can check if the work is good or not and decide either to keep the information o to make some changes. So, the group can have more opportunity to have a better grade. Third, Work as a group can also be fun because you are working with your friends or you can met new people. First, work in group can be a good for class because they can know each other. If the class meet each other the class can be more successful. Because there will not fight or enmity so the class can work more successfully. If a class is works more successfully that makes the topic easy and knowing each other makes the class more understanding. And, It will make the class more fun because everyone can help each other in thing that are hard for people. For example, if one student cant understand the topic he can ask for help to the teacher and he can ask to people around hem for help. In conclusion, work as a group is funny and make the class better. Also, it makes the students to do better workers and meet people. therefore, I think that work will be better in groups because the class can meet and know each other and they can be better person and better students. This are some reasons why a think that work in groups is better.",5,5,6,5,5,5,1616,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
4,786,E0656353B8F2,"School districts shouldnt give the three year instead of four year program. Why? because students should receive all the education they need to succeed everything they want with completing four years of high school. Most colleges look for students that have completed four years of their high school education, also they dont like when students have free periods unless they have a specific reason of requesting free courses. Students will always have time to do what are they want in life with a four year high diploma it doesnt matter if your birthday is late and you want to graduate with three years because you dont wanna graduate at that specific age. Teachers, parents,siblings, they should be the ones telling theyre children or young adult that it is important to complete there four years of high school. The process you have to follow to do a three year of high school is more stressful because you have to summer school or evening school where there are not really a lot of teachers to help out with most of the stuff you need help with. When your in school you have English, history, science, mathematics teachers, you have counselors librarians everyone that can help you with anything you need to finish high school. Most students may graduate early because they have an illness, disease, or something and they just cant take the pressure of being in school no more. From my point of view parents should always talk to there children about how important education is for them they can pursue all there dreams if the parent didnt have the opportunity to finish there high school career. Also entering college early wouldnt be so convenient because maybe the student missed something they didnt learn then when they get to college there like my teacher didnt teach me this or I dont know what that is. The work force accepts a lot of young teenage children that graduate from high school and expect them to have a high school diploma and of course theyll have a high school diploma but they wont know how many years they completed which I believe still shouldnt be accepted. Children think that just because they have a high school diploma theyre better then everyone else if you only completed three years you shouldnt feel superior to everyone else. I would feel disappointed in myself for not completing all the four years I needed because I would feel like I didnt complete everything I need to be the most intelligent most outgoing person I am. If your a child that believes you cant do it and finish high school because its stressful, of course you can do it I punish myself all the time for saying that. I may not be the most smartest person in my family but im giving it my all to complete my high school career as an older sister and role model of two younger siblings that I have. Also if your a three year completer you should always take younger siblings in to consideration because they look up to you and they are gonna think that just by completing three years its OK. To be someone successful in life finish all four years of your high school education schools shouldnt provide three year programs for students or at the age of eighteen they can drop out they are going to get no job no one will accept them without an education. There is nothing good out in the world without an education or some type of proof that you have completed or have gone to school. In conclusion, to all of this children, teenagers, anyone take in mind that colleges, jobs, anything will most likely look for a four year completer because if they see you as a three year completer theyll take the other person instead of you. Even if you have all the requirements you needed to complete high school you still really didnt finish your career. Schools should stop providing this program and make students complete there four years in high school because it is very important for them to get an education till they are 18 and they are free to make their own decisions if they want to drop or just do three years of high school. And dont be the type of person to just finish high school with three years and do nothing after you have decided to not finish school you just decide to drop out to be home and do nothing for yourself. Be the bigger person and take full responsibility of your education because you only have yourself throughout your journey in high school there will be no friends once it comes down to your senior year in high school. The more you pressure your self to finish high school the more stressful and painful itll be for yourself because you may not have all the requirements completed and you have to complete them in summer school thats why parents and teachers mentors anyone should always come in and talk to the child and make them finish what they have left of there high school career nothing is impossible. Do what you can to complete and finish high school with all your four years and youll be the most hard working work force person ever or the best and college student that completed all four years and will complete all her college years needed to succeed to accomplish there dreams or whatever they want to do.",7,5,7,7,5,6,3194,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
5,787,4B0CF2CFCB4A,"Should people follow their own instincts, or should they follow other people step? If people seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters they would not fail in life; however, people should make their own decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience through the life. First, people should make their own decision because they can define their self. Every single person should make a difference on the world. For example, I do not like to be guide for others person, I like to be different than every one else, try new things, and have my own ideas. Also, around the world are many people that are known for define their personality and for try to change the world with their ideas. Barack Obama is one of them, he was known for his humanity and his charismatic. Every person was made it to perform extraordinary different decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self. Next, people should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Many times ours instinct are right, but sometimes we let others person tell as what to do, therefore we fail. For example, when we are taking a test and we make cheating, we fail the test because we not even like to try and follow our instincts. When I have to take a test and I do not know much about the test, I just follow my instincts and at the end, I got good result because is not necessary to do what others persons do. Is more about what you believe that is the best. There is not major accomplishment than do your best, to believe on your-self. People should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Finally, people should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. When a person make their owns decision do not matters if they are successful, or if they fail. Because at the end they learned how it was it and how to do next time. But if they never try, they never would know how hard, or easily is achieve something. For example, last year I fail all my SOL because an friend told me that he pass it all his SOL and was easily. He suppose to be a expert, so I truth he. But was not tru and I learned that is better try by my self. now I capable to give advice to anthers students and help them. If I never had make my own decisions, I would never get experience. People should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience. Every person should make the difference on the World and express their own ideas. When people follow their instincts we accomplish good result. Also, when people got experience through the life following their instinct they could be successful and are capable to advice other people. Every single person have different opinions, decisions, and experiences. With differents person we can build a rich world.

7,789,72913948CDAA,"Positive Life Do you have to be positive attitude to have success in the life? The answer for this question yes, because in the life everyone should be positive, and successful in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Their are a lot of reasons and evidence to have good life. The most important one is be positive because being positive make the life better. For example, when the person are positive that will make the person have a lot of friends, if the person are positive that makes him/her happy, and the person will pass all his/her test with good score or in his/her job be the smarter one. First, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because when the person positive that will makes him/her have a lot of friends. For example, Generic_Name always smiling and positive. So, everyone in her school loved her and they want to be friends with her. So, now she is positive girls with a lot of friends. Being positive makes the life more better. As well as, if the person are positive he/she will always be happy. Second, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive, because that help the person to pass all his/her test with good score or in their job to be the smarter one.

Also he is the good person in his job. Positive person will have the most beautiful life and will live with peace. Some people may argue that to try to be a positive person because the world we born on sometimes have a lot of problems. That is true because the world looks like the mountain sometimes hard to claim it, and the life looks the same usually its hard to be happy and positive because sometimes their is a problem or something happened makes you feel sad, and negative, and makes you feel that you hate your life, but everyone have to try to be positive, and to love his/her own life because if the person always negative that will makes him/her sick, sad, mad, and complicate. However, to be positive that will protect you from a lot of problems gonna happened to you. To summery, in order to be happy, and intelligent everyone must be positive. Just be positive to get the most beautiful life ever. Overall, if anyone want to be positive is not the hard work its easy, and again relax, and get the good breath, try to lose all the negative ideas. Lastly, enjoy with the positive life.

8,790,21535555126A,"I agree that you shouldnt aim high, because when you aim high you never have a staring point to your own process, if you aim high it could ruin your work ethic and how you see yourself, and lastly you can make muiltiple mistakes and correct it and make it perfect work, compared to aiming and doing horrible work and falling back down to the bottom. When you aim low you have way more time to gain information, practice on your work, and have a good idea on what you want to do. For example the creator of Microsoft Bill Gates he didnt just wake up one morning and said"" im going to create a software system named windows"" he woke up and began to study computers, and everything about how a software works. So aiming low gives you the advantage of failing and not giving up on what you want to become. Most people are always told to ""aim high"" the ones that are told to aim high will never be able to handle failure because they never aimed low first and then worked their way to the top, that is how setting your aim to high can make you fall short in life. Aiming high, and having a high expectation can really hurt your work ethic, Why you ask? because once you aim high and never practice on your work thats how you fail, the way you work will not be the same compared to a person who aimed low and is making his or her way to the top. For example Delonte West was a NBA basketball player he was really good, until he began to use drugs once he did that he was kicked out of the NBA and is now currently poor. You see the reason why the NBA kicked him out of the league was because they have very high expectations for him and wouldnt expect him to do drugs at all but, if he was using drugs before he even entered the league and stopped using them completely and went to the NBA he would still be playing to this day that is a good example of aiming high and falling short and aiming low and achieving your mark. The only way to start in any journey or process that you do is to start from the bottom meaning aim low and youll achieve your mark. Aiming high can not benefit how you were able to make it to where you are now. That is true Michaelangelo was right about aiming high and falling short. So you must start low first figure out your plan, then begin to improvise and get ideas on what you want to do, and begin your process, that is exactly how you achieve your mark In conclusion, i highly agree on what Michaelangelo said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"" that statement was true, Aiming and srting low first is how ideas come in and you are able to see what you are working and you show people what you can do until you reach your highest peak, instead of aiming high and failing and not knowing what to do now cause you failed. So start low first and go on from there.",7,6,8,7,8,6,442,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
9,791,6F0330A6C504,"This shows how students could think and have thoughts about what they want in the future, a career is what benefits them in their lives, preparing them would make a change in their minds on what they really are interested in or what would they want to be successful in their future, it would take time to prepare to finally decide whats on their minds to choose their careers as a young age, this opportunities will make a big change is students choose wisely. After keep studying students should make positions on what they already are studying,thinking as a young age students are more creative with their minds and heart; Students should think as young age for a beneficial purpose,deciding on a career at a lower grade (8th) many societies et their students have this opportunities to choose their path and make changes on what they really want in their life,there changing from a playful mind into a mind where teenagers starts to make decisions; In reality this is a path where they would finally decide what they want or could be do for being graduated as a honorable person, by doing the most of the students frequently found what they would do and could be doing on their future as a older person, as they think they organize them self and be more clear on their positions in life. This could make a big change for teenagers, now they show they can make a more positive and strong decisions, to show that they make better decisions as a lower grade society could being tested for all middle schoolers and keep track on how do students on how they are getting ideas as they turn from Middle School to High School; Most of the students decide good careers and some of them great careers, but is not only about choosing a career is about what students could think as a teenager; having students deciding on what they think there going to be success. However, letting young kids think on what there going to study as a career would not be the best because not all students want to keep studying before High School; it would be a waste of time and effort to give them a great opportunities to start thinking as young adults, this could not benefit all students because as they get into High School they keep changing careers and by the end of their 4 school year they didnt decide what career they want to take, most of students end up not enjoying their career and giving up deciding they shouldnt get that career and deciding to not finish the college. Therefore, students could not take a career they didnt want but if they know they could pass and be an excellent person, even in the career they didnt decide to take they could make even a better life in their future by choosing and changing the career they were thinking as they were at Middle School, they continue thinking on what they want until they reach what theyre looking for in real life as a young adults. By telling this students should see and think very carefully as parents understands their children and teachers helping their students how they could or might do to get that career on what they need to focus on, for society is really difficult to choose right ways hat might help students and which ones might not letting students choose sense their getting more knowledge they will increase the capacity to get into what career benefits them as students,there are many student that want a career and the society helps them with their courses a they are getting into High School, their final thoughts and knowledge finish for them and they should start to think more in what he career is and how theyre going to deal with their job ",6,7,8,8,7,7,1449,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

That is the beuty of life,connecting with different types of people with different types of personalitys. People in this world now a days are cruel and mean that have no heart. People bully others because of theres clothes,shoes, and how they look. You can get bullied for anything now a days, its very sad. Thats why people who get bullied hate themselves and want to become something they are not. I remember one point in my life, i was deppressed. I kept getting bullied because of how big my head was or how skinny i was. I know it sounds funny, i laugh all the time when i talk about it dont worry. I stopped wanting to come to school because of that. I never wanted to leave my house or talk to anyone. It was very sad. But one day one of my close friends asked me why i wasnt coming to school, and i told him everything. He told me straight up to ignore all the negative stuff that people call me and live your life to the fullest. Since that day, we have been bros for life. He always had my back and i always had his. A few weeks passed and i told my mother. We talked for a few hours about how i should ignore all the negative stuff because life is so short that you cant let anything stop you. That really changed me and how i see life. Trying to be yourself in this world is very difficult now a days. Just by telling someone that there shoes are ugly can really change the whole person. They start buying stuff that they dont really like. Also doing stuff they dont want to do. Suddenly they start doing bad stuff. Just to fit in with other people that have all the nice clothes and shoes etc. People really cant be themselves because of judgment. There should be more help in this world so people that are going through this can get help. People should be motivated to be themselves and also love themselves. Some people can really say somethig mean and the victim could commite suicide, just because of someones judgment. People should start treating other people with respect.

Also most students have a part time job after school and wont fit everyones schedule. There is a lot to do after school and extending school two more hours would not help. It also would not only affect the students but the teachers too. Some teachers have a second job to go to after school, Some teachers have children to go take care of at home. Also it is scientifically proven, That if students are in school for more than the seven hours they usually are in school, The students mind shut down. once the mind shuts down the body does too. So whenever the teacher is teaching the students isnt picking up the information and isnt learning anything. The student isnt focousing and also tired.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live.

14,796,519A1A92C8C8,"Success consist of going from failure to failure withouth loss of enthusiasm, and Im agree with this statement, because can do what it wants if try and try, and everything is doing with effort , and than a failure can be for a better oportunity in the future. Did you heard that failured means success sometime? well effort is the best way that you can reach what you wish. Can do what it wants if try and try, so let me tell you something about a friend that is close to me, and he was in failre to failure, so one time he came to me and he told me his problems, and than he cry and I tell him, ""dont worry everything will be okay"", and than he said - Im gonna try again this is the second time that I failure, and I will try again until to have what I want, and I tell him that I always will be there for him, because he is my friend and the friend is to be there for each other when it need, and then two years later he told me that he finally has what he was trying to do in the pass and he was very happy and I was happy too. If my friend didnt try he were unhappy, and maybe he were a miserable person, but he were strong and he did it. do you know ""what you can do with effort"", means? effort is something that it has to be preasent in your life everything is made it with effort, when I was 14 years old I was in my country, I was in 9th grade, and my friends and I was happy for our graduation, but I was acared because we had a final exam and the exam was about my country history, but is not that simple because I had to know a book of 6 parragraph, and some of the parragraph is like 10 sentences each, and I had to tell to the principal the antire book, so and then I had to learn 50 question about my country that it comes in the book too, so I had to take the test writing about this 50 question, but I already took one and I fail, and I was scared about it, but I tell my self you can do it, you have to pass, and I was studying averyday after school at my home, with my friends, and sometimes my counsins help me how to do it, or they help me to learn; they asking me the questions to know if I knew correctly each question and answer, so the day of the test I was a little scared and nervios, because I feel I will forget everything, and finally it was my turn, and I did it right I was so happy with myself because it was hard, I put all my effort in this test and I did it, and my frinds and I graduate at the same time. If I were lazy and not interest in to pass this exam maybe I had to repeat the school year and I were disappointed with my self. A failure can be for a better opportunity in the future. Now I come with a anecdote of my uncle Generic_Name that already died he was illiterate, and his job was the security in a night club, and that was his job in his entire life, and one day the boss went with new rules for everyone, and his boss tell him his job -you have to write the number and the name of the people that come in the nightclub every day, and my uncle tell to his boss -I would like to do that Sr. but I can not read and write Im illiterate and I can not do what you are asking for my Sr. his boss tell him -Im so sorry Generic_Name but if it is like that you can not work anymore here, and my uncle Generic_Name answer, -but what Im going to do I can not do anything else this was my job in my entire life. His boss said, -Im sorry Generic_Name. And then my uncle left the place he was upset telling to himself what Im goin to do I need a job, and he remerber that he fix the chairs of the night club, and he said -I can do that in the town and earn some money just for my food , and he went to his house and find some nail and tools, but that was not anough, and he had some save money and he went to the city to buy what he needs; the way to get to the city was two days in mule and when he come back to the town the next day his neighborhood went to his house and told to my uncle -you have a hammer that I can borrow, and my uncle tell him -Yes! but I cant borrow you my hammer, because I need it I have to work, and his neighborhood said -Please I can bring you tomorrow in the morning, and my uncle puzzling said -Ok! At the next day his neighborhood tell to my uncle -where did you buy this hammer because is really good can I give you the money and you can go buy other one for you, and my uncle said -well its okay Im going tomorrow in the morning, the other neighborhood knew that he will go to the city to buy some things and they ask if he can bring things to them, and they will pay extra money, and he tell them - okay no problem Im come back in two day then he were thinking about how he will earn money doing travels to the city, and buying things for the other people in the town, so he decide that will be his job and than he did it, and earn enough money that he ask to the store but a truck come to drope the merchandise to his house, and like that he were improve his little store in the town than he remerber one of his friend can make tools and like that they fabricate the tools and they find more people to make it too, and little by little he make a a big hardware it was the first hardware in the town; the day to open for the first time his hardware someone ask him to sing in the book and he said - I would like to sing, but I can not read and write, and the man said - WHAT! I can not believe that Sr. if you made this factore been illiterate what would you do if you could read and write, and he asnwer maybe I keep my old job and I still were a security of a night club. if my uncle didnt try to find some job for himself he didnt reach all the he had at that time.

15,797,DA86BC9B9FB6,"I think is a good choice for people to take classes online or at home because they can learn more and concentrate better and put more attention and nobody can distract them. I think if people do it online or at home they are not going to make friends. Sometimes is good to make friends because they can help you or be with you in someway is good to go school then taking at home or online. Also if they do it online or at home they are going to be more prepared and ready for wet ever situation because they was putting attention in their lessons. But being in a group in school is more interesting because you can meet new people and dont be alone doing the work but everything have their good choices for do it and people can decide how they want to do it or how much they want lo learn. some people prefer to take classes from home or online. because they can be more concentrate without nobody distracting them. I think it will be a good choice for them to do it online. For example if they are doing work in a group they are talking and dont concentrated but if they are with nobody they can work better and do their work. This can be the reason for more people take that classes because they work better with out no one else. The people who studies online or at home are more intelligent, and learn more because they are concentrate in what they are doing. In sometimes in the schools they are not concentrate because they are playing or talking with their friends and that can distract people. If they make a competition an student who studied on line or at home with one student is a regular school I think the student is not on the school can win because sometimes that students are more prepared then the regular school. Also sometime the students who go to a regular school they just go for play with their friends is good to have some friends but they are not concentrate o they are sleeping when the teacher is explaining and then when they do the exam or quiz they fail. But if one student is studding online or at home they are listening for when they have to take the exams they can pass and are more responsible with that. When the school is over at the end of the year some people learn a lot but some people no because they were just playing and dont putting attention or sleeping in class. But the people who studies online or at home they are ready know a lot because they were concentrated and no one was distracting them and that if how they work someones want to learn and pass and someones no each one can take their own decision. I think studies online is more better, more productive at the and of the year. Taking classes at home can benefit at the students in many ways and they know more at the end of the school. When the students at the regular school at the end of the year they have an SOL test. some students fail this test because they did not learn nothing for the rest of the year just for be sitting and doing nothing. But if someone who studies at home have the ability to pass the SOL because they were interested of the class of what were they learning and dont have distractions all year.

16,798,AA7B4CC7EE1B,"A positive attitude is what we expect in everything and everyone whether it be from;a customer service employee,teachers speaking to sporadic students,and or a bus driver driving a bus full of disrespectful kids. The lessons they burn in your head as a kid is that a positive attitude can take you places beyond your wildest dreams and those who have a negative attitude will have a unfortunate future brought upon themselves, in all honesty through my words I dont believe a positive attitude can lead to a successful life its our decisions in the making that do decide it instead. The saying that nice guys finish last is one heck of an understatement in the least, you could be the most positive person on the planet and still have shortcomings when it comes to a successful life . A positive attitude is just what it is, it doesnt guarantee anything sure it might be helpful when getting the things you want in life but it can only go so far in within its own limitations whether it be giving and employer a positive attitude during a job interview of a job youve always wanted while ignoring how severely under qualified you are in the field. The idea alone of someone truly believing that you can be successful with a positive attitude is a joke,if anything the person believing a positive attitude is what makes them successful isnt in on the joke they are the joke. Similar to a positive attitude a negative is never a guarantee to a successful life at least with a negative attitude you wont see the world in rose colored glasses if anything you see it for the harsh reality it truly is rather then doing pointless things to make life just a little bit more worth your time rather then forcing a positive attitude just to take in the world easier. In my eyes its just some facade we all have the ability to put up but some choice to live in la la land while others live in the real world dealers choice really. Our attitudes is just one thing that can change the course of our lives the real way we make it in life is how we do so with our decisions towards that successful life that everyone desires. Its a bittersweet reality on those who constantly maintain a positive attitude those kind of people are taken advantage of their kindness and will often be misunderstood with the people around them. The real way to live is to have an iron will that shows that you are not someone to be messed with but, someone who is respected and can hold their own with making heavy decisions rather then keeping it all happy go lucky. The debate about whether or not a positive attitude or a negative attitude can make you successful in life is kinda of like those other world debates about what happens when we die, is there life other then humankind, is there really a god. Its all based on interpretations or our upbringings into this beautiful disgusting world that is life you can be born with a sliver spoon in the mouth with a negative or born in a war torn country with a positive attitude its not about how we should make a successful life with attitudes its about how we make of it.",8,9,10,10,9,9,2281,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

18,800,A5F6E232286C,"First of all technology has helped people in many ways to do various sort of things when people are in need of something. When technology was first introduced many people didnt know how it could be used to help save lives or help build buldings,schools,malls everything that we have today is because of how benefical technology is to us. The lack of human contact is not using technology too, much its by the person who chooses to use his or hers cellphone, computer and television while technology takes a important positive impact in peoples lives it also helps save peoples lives. For example in hospitals technology evolves every year so that when people come in very sick it helps them by detetecting what they have or whats going on with a accurate solution. However people may say that technology has negative effects on people because it removes there social skills and the way people interact with each other because in older generations there was a lack of technology and people would communicate with others when they were in need of something. In contrast humans also have a choice to check out books,shop and play games without human contact. Many people still go out and shop in stores many also enjoy going to the libary to check out books even though we cant go to blockbuster and check out movies anymore we can always go watch one in a movie theater. Technology has come a long way from its past and it continues to progress and evolve every year we move up as we continue to progress the future might be filled with just technology. The way i use technology are in many different ways i put a alarm to wake me up i also use my computer when im doing home work or projects that i need to finish its also useful when im stuck or dont know what something means so i use my phone and search it up online to find the meaning of a word or subject. In my opinion i think its very helpful and positive to my life it has helped me in many ways and it gets me through also in school activities i dont think it has impacted me to a negative side because going to go play soccer or doing something else has not stop me from socializing with others around me. In conclusion technology can be very helpful or in some ways bad for peoples lives i think that technology no matter what will just get better and help many other just like it has helped me.

21,803,00ED2563D0B1,"Philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once said "" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I strongly agree, imagine you being the reason why a person decided to make a remarkable change in there life just by following your footsteps, imagine how that would make you feel. Setting a good example everyday is one of the most important things you can do in life; you dont know who is watching you, and you dont know who is getting an impact from your good ways. People watch others every move and learn new and better things as time goes so they can also turn out to influence others. Consider yourself as a leader being able to influence people is a leadership movement, everyone needs someone to help them and guide them through things they may not tell you, but theyll watch your examples and learn. Many may think that there are better ways unlike setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others; but little do they know that setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others. Setting good examples is helpful in so many ways however; there are other ways to influence others. People get influenced on anything these days, just sitting around and watching TV can influence you to do something. But think about it would you rather have someone set examples for you, and have someone you can watch to motivate you and guide you; or would you rather sit around and procrastinate on time?. As the influencer having people look up to you and following the way you move is a big deal. For example when surgical interns first go to a hospital to work they look up to their head surgeons. The head surgeons set examples for the interns because they want them to be successful, the intern watching the head surgeon during operations and check ups influences and motivates them to do better and be better. Even for school students thats how they all learn from examples the teachers show them, it influences the students to try so they can also be good at what their teaching is teaching them. Some people may prefer to get influenced in another way because they may not want someone by them step by step they may be more independent and like to be on there own. Having good behavior benefits you in a lot of ways, you will get a lot of opportunities, help and inspire a lot of people and gain a lot. For example parents have a good influence on there kids. They are the reason why there kids wake up and try every day, seeing your parents have a good and positive behavior will motivate and influence you to do better. As you go on with good behavior people will see you and begin to know that there is something your doing to be happy. You will have people come around you because of your vibe and good energy. Once they start talking to you you automatically begin to influence them to be a better person. Knowing that you are a motivator and an influence onto others is a good feeling. You will know that your good work and good behavior has a good effect strong enough to influence others in the best way possible. Overall setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence others, they learn better, feel comfortable and get to experience a lot. Having someone look up to you as a good influence will help you both because it will make you both feel great and you both will benefit from it in the long run. We have people around us for a reason, if you have someone that is willing to help you and influence you to be better in life take the chance because it will be a great experience and you will change as a person once you get influenced in the right way by the right people in life.",7,6,7,7,7,8,14,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

They would work as hard as they could for a better and brighter future. For that specific reason,committing a career by the time they enter high school would be a bad idea for the students. They would need more knowledges,they would be too young to to decide,and that could also ruin their dreams. Students should not commit a career by the time they enter high school because they would not benefit from it. firstly to begin with,lack of knowledges could not only destroy their dreams,but also them. They would not have enough experience. Everything would be confusing for them because they didnt have a chance to learn them back in high school. One thing for sure,they wouldnt be good at it as well as they would be if they finished high school and attended college. Also,they wouldnt be as open as they should be. Secondly another,being young and have to decide something that is going to be a big part of their future is the hardest decision. They might regret it in the future. There is a fifty percent chance that theyd change their mind when they grow up. When they are young,scared,and have pressure on them they usually make the worst decision,but later in life when they would finally realize it. Itll be too late to fix it. They also would even blame their parents in some kind of way. Also,that one decision can ruin their life and dreams completely. They wouldnt even be interested in going to college. They might drop out high school when they would start recieving checks because they need money and they get it at least every week,""so whats the point of going to college"",they would think. They would also need more time to think and decide what they really want before choosing something they might regret. In conclusion,not only high school students,but every other kids in general have the right to have enough time to decide what they want when they feel ready to. They need to finish high school,go to college,and have a chance to choose what they want to be. When they dont have enough experience they are usually shy and scared when doing something because they dont know what they are doing.

He told me that I got a B and I got mad because I got a B I was all like how and he told me that there was soda every where. it was messy and it had mentos in it and I was like please give me an A or can i at least remake it. He was like you can have one more chance to remake it I was all like thank you. it took me a while to make it and think what I can do so it wont spill anywhere. So I thought of putting a cone around the volcano put I was all like nah because whats the whole point of putting it if you cant see it. I got an idea I put a lighter in side and a put a special paint that blows up with just fire. it can not make a mess I dont have to clean the floor I think this the best idea. i did it and i tryed it out at my house and it always blew up every where and I kept on thinking and thinking but I had no idea Ithought that it had to much paint and iI kep on putting it little by little. It kinda worked if I put a little in a bootle and light it like that but thene I had an idea that if a put newspaper under it and let it burn it will help it and it did and then i kept putting more and more news paper it took like 16 news of paper and my brother helped me do it it was hard because i didnt know which way to put it. I got it all finished and I took it to school.

25,807,297ABDDBAA92,"How is possible to people think that success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I agree with ministre Winston; it always would be a new oportunitie to change the mistake people learn from failure. It gives everyone a chance to corret it. I also believe that failure is an important part in life to people must have success. One notable reason is that people learn from failure. For example, sometimes people get involved in some sadness problems that consist in failure. People have the oportunitie to corret it; they would be able to reach their dreams or goals not matter how harder is life people always have to strive with enthusiasm. Moreover, in my personal opinon, 3 years ago I was playing for a soccer team I get involved in a situation where I got really stressful with myself because I training hard for playing the final game with my team. Unfortunately, I cant play the final game because the game before I commited a foul and I get a red card. my team loss the game, it was too lake for me do anything about it. I realized that not matter what I did in the past; it always be a new oportunitie for improve and teach myself that failure its has an important role in life to be success. Futhermore, another important reason is that it gives people a better chance to corret it. This reminds me to a friend, who was in a situation where he was really disappoint because he fail his driving test. The next day, he cames to my house and talk to me about it. I remember that I told him to keep in his mind that its important to be prepare for any situation that you know you have a lot of chances to pass if you triying and triying you will get on it. A lack of success depending in achieving goals and dreams. I think that failure is also a way to teach people that even if you fail you just always have to try no matter how many times you try it as long as you trying without lossing the enthusiasm you will reach your dreams, or goals. Some people would argue that success is not consist in failure; however, everyone in our society knows that failure is an important part in life to be success. People learn from failure and it gives people a better chance to corret it. There is not limits to reach ours dreams as long as you keep going to complete it.

27,809,AA53069FF4B4,"I believe that working in groups benefits more than someone working alone. Working in groups help you gather more knowledge, you get to learn and have fun, and you get to finish faster. When my group comes together, we all start giving each other ideas of our own knowledge to make the project successful. Although some may know more than others, but others may know things that some dont. I also like when my group shares ideas because are project can be much more creative. Some people may believe that someone working alone can also have as much knowledge than someone working in groups. However I believe that working in groups can benefit you on having more knowledge. Getting together with my group makes learning fun. When we start the project every one would start concentrated so that when we get close to finishing we can talk to each other. People would quietly take a break and talk so that they dont get overwhelmed. . Although, some people may believe that being groups detracts and working alone does not. However, getting detracted is something you would choose to do and not something I would choose to do. I always felt like being in groups time would pass really fast. In a group everyone would choose what they wanna work on or work on something they know more of. When everyone is working on something it reminds me of a job, because every job wants to make the job done as soon as possible. When time flies i feel good because the job is done and i get to relax. Some people may believe that students that work alone like to take there time and do there project at there own style and make it knit. However, I am a type of guy that likes to get my job done and quick, and I believe there is a lot of people that are the same type.

28,810,591164D3C800,"I agree with Albert Schweitzer "" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is he only thing."" Setting a example to others its the best way to influence others because for example there are two students named Generic_Name and Generic_Name. Both of them are in the same school. Generic_Name has good grades he is always doing his school work, never dose anything to upset the teachers or get in terable while Generic_Name is the complet opposite. Generic_Name has poor grades, always talking back to his teachers and never dose his school work he also get in to fights with other students. Generic_Name has a idea he wants to help Generic_Name to become a better person and influence him to do well in school. Generic_Name have the same first block class as Generic_Name. Generic_Name decided to get bad grades and talk back to his teachers. Generic_Name is doing all of this because he wants Generic_Name to realize just because you have bad grades in school that dose not mean you can not change that. The next day Generic_Name gets good grade he apolegize to his teachers and Generic_Name seas Generic_Name having bad geades and the next day Generic_Name change that and started doing good agine. Generic_Name thinks to him self if Generic_Name can change so can I. The first thing he dose is to go and apolagize to his teachers for being rude he started studing, getting good grades.

30,812,07CE77EA56C5,"Students work hard there is no arguing that. They have schoolwork, homework, extracurricular and maybe work, all these things make a students life stressful so it is important that they get a break every once in a while. I believe that students should get a long summer break, instead of a year-round school year, because, firstly, there are other activities that can be done during the summer that keep students minds active, secondly their health is at risk and lastly, summer break is beneficial to school staff as well. From time to time, people need to get a break from their day-today life they need to take a moment to relax and enjoy their life and maybe discover an interest that they may have. Although school is important and necessary for success later on in life, so are outside experiences that can contribute to the development of a students real life skills. During summer break there are multiple activities that can be done in order to keep a students mind active, whether it may be sports, summer camps, summer jobs etc. All these activities allow for their minds and bodies to stay active. Eventhough, they are not keeping their brains engaged in terms of school work and studying they are exposing themselves to new activities that might require them to think critically, open-mindedly and collaboratively; which I feel is essential for real life. For example, a student might be at summer camp and they are put in a group with four strangers and are given a challenging task that requires them to collaborate with the other member of the group, critically analyzing the situation and coming up with solutions and be open-minded to listening and trying to understand the perspectives of their peers. This also reflects their environment in school therefore, it can be said that they are keeping their minds active while outside of school. Although, not all students might be involved in activities outside of school, some are taking a break from the stress of life itself. Due to all the demands in their life during the school year summer break is a good way to take a breather and take care of themselves mentally. Depression has been very common in teenagers in recent years, and although it may not be entirely due to the stress of school, school does contribute to the detirriation of their mental health. In addition, over-working ones self has negative impacts overall whether they are depressed or not. Too much stress in ones life can have negative effects on their health overall. High blood pressure, hypertension, severe weight loss are a few examples of the effects stress. Furthermore, when stressed our body releases a neurotransmitter called Cortisol, this neurotransmitter in excess can impair a persons thinking and reaction time; which is very important for students as they are required to think in order to complete school work and homework, therefore, if they dont take breaks their grades are probably going to drop due to their inability to think effectively, further contributing to their detirriating mental health. Lastly, summer break is and essential time for everyone that is involved in schools, such as teachers, administrators, councilors etc. Although schools are intended to educate students, its the school staff that make this possible. This is why we need to give our school staff a break because all the points I stated above also applies to them. In addition, with a long summer break teachers are able to have more time to thoroughly think about their lesson plans for their students as well as have an extended amount of time to live their lives and enjoy time with their family and friends, after all, teachers are humans too and they need to be able to life their lives and forget that they are required to do so much for such little pay. To emphasize further, I believe that schools should give students a long summer break instead of a year-round school year because a students mind will stay active during the summer through various activities that require students to think open-mindedly, critically and collaboratively. Also, students need a break in order to de-stress for the sake of their health mentally and physically. Lastly, a long summer break is needed for school staff as well because they also need to take a break, as well as the students.

31,813,2C9EA803FF3A,"Success comes from failure and failure occurs when something doesnt happen. As I think and based on my experience I am agree with the statement of Ralph Waldo Emerson, because when someone dont do anything they will never get to the success and cant achieve any skills, so its important to mastered and have skills in your life. everyone should have skills in more than one because life is hard and without trying more it will become more harder. As Emerson says: ""you will never grow"" it means that no succeed is possible without skills in different things. If someone doesnt know anything without their profession in daily life, what do you think will it be easy for him to live like that? Off course not, because life need everything and we will face hardships too and for being successful in our life we have to know everything and try everything beside that we have mastered. For example: someone has skills in engineering but they dont get any job and he want to start his personal business in which he doesnt have any skills, we know that it will be difficult for him to start because he doesnt know anything about business, so if he try and make a way for his business then he will get skills. Our skills in more then one profession make us famous and shows our personality to other people and makes us more responsible in our life. Getting mastered in more then one will make you famous and successful. Life does not remain in one situation and life is going to change in every second. Also humans are not same as well because everyone is getting older day by day so who knows what will happen next without Allah. For example: Everyone of us need to do different tasks and get our skills but beside that our life also need skills for our future generation and it is very important for every human being to have skills in their life because they have to show the right and wrong ways to their children. If you are a skillful person then everyone will want to meet you because everyone need to know from the person who is mastered and you will become famous and fame is the way to success and without trying noting success is way too much hard. Knowledge doesnt ends because its like a sea and sea doesnt stop. All of human beings needs to learn and they must learn. knowledge is not just a book and a school that we do in daily life. For example: We cant achieve more skills from our books but we can be mastered if we try different from the book and try something new. If we just try and learn from our books then it will be too much harder to achieve everythings skills from reading book beside reading we have to work and search for it and again trying is best option for success and growth. We know that knowledge is more important then everything else but also without skill even knowledge is nothing. If we dont have skills then we dont know how to use our knowledge and our skills comes from doing different tasks and without trying something different success is hard and growth of mind is impossible. I am agree with Emerson and what does he says is based on his experience and if we think of those things then we can find the right answer. As I mentioned life is hard and our life need more skills to go further and getting mastered in more then one profession will make us famous and successful in our further life and being famous and successful needs more hard work to try different from what we already know. Work hard, be active and dont fear because time doesnt wait and our growth of mind and success comes from try different and hard in our life.",7,7,6,7,5,6,592,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
32,814,F8B49772E887,"Therefore, I agree with being honest all the time because it will help you gain trust with other. This can also sat that the person thinks you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more then they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK. When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People dont like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self. Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need. When I said they would view you different I meant by your personalty and how you are as a person. Yes, honesty can hurt them,but, lying hurts the most. Why Im saying this because honesty can hurt but it make them feel better because they have someone they trust and believ them, a real friend.

33,815,F28D4ACF03AA,"I have multiple talents and skills, but my favorite one is skateboarding. Skateboarding is a very difficult skill it takes several hours, days maybe even years to accomplish and learn a trick on a skateboard, but thats why its such a unique sport and skill. Skateboarding has become a daily activity for me, it takes all my stress and problems away, thats why I enjoy it so much. I skate everywhere to the store, a friends house, and maybe even to school. although I get lots of injuries like scrapes, bruises and many more I still love this sport because skateboarding has taught me a lot like, being able to be confident when i try new things, getting right back up when I fall, and being able to learn from my mistakes. Skateboarding isnt just a sport, skill, activity or hobby its a way of life and even tho it may not be the safest sport ever its still one of my favorite skills that I think I wont get bored of any time soon. When I was nine I had lots of friends that would skateboard and I didnt know anything about skateboarding at the time so it was really cool being able to observe such a unique sport. I would always see them practicing and skating everywhere and that encouraged me one day to try it. So a couple days later I went up to my parents and told them that I wanted to try something new and it was skateboarding, my mom said she would think about it because she didnt want me to hurt my self, but my dad on the other hand told me to just go for it and thats exactly what I did. The next day after school I asked my mom if we could go to the nearest skate shop and she said yes. Once we got to the the skate shop I was looking around and i was so confused I saw decks wheels and so much more that i didnt even know about. So as I walked in the guy that was working there asked me ""is there something specific you are looking for"". I told him I was new to skateboarding and that ive never been on top of one, so he taught me what i needed to know about a skateboard like about the deck, grip tape, trucks, wheels, and hardware. After that we got into assembling my first ever skateboard. Once I was done picking out all the stuff that was going to be on my skateboard we payed and he stared assembling it, once he finished we left the skate shop and it was to dark so I didnt get to skate that day sadly. The next day I get back home from school I put down my backpack and I imedietly went outside to try my new skateboard out the only thing i knew was to ride but i imedietly fell in love with skating. Since that day ive been skating every day and if its not every day its every other day. ",5,7,7,7,6,5,3591,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"
34,816,1451EA314B8A,"Students in the classroom always debate about working alone, or in groups, both of the ways of work have beneficial and non beneficial aspects,In fact; some students do not like to work in groups, they may say things like people in their groups do not do anything ,and they would rather to work by themselves, but in my personal opinion working in groups is a better idea. When students work in groups they can divide the assignment in different pieces, in that way it can be easier for each person in the group, another aspect to think about is that students in the group can help out each other. Working in groups will also be less stressful for each person in the group. First, when students work in groups they could perfectly divide the assignment in small portions. for instance, if they have a project about global warming, they could tell each person to find something different, one person can find the characteristics of global warming, a different person the reasons why it happens, and someone else some examples of the topic. Second, students always need help ,and they could help each other in the group. Help out each others in the group is a good way to develop team work, it may help them when they go to college, or after when they grow up and have jobs. Furthermore, teach students about team work is a really beneficial aspect to think about because students are the future of this society, and teach them how to work with others is going to help them to develop an open-mind. Another important thing is that they would have less stress, if they work as a team and divide the work, they will feel less stress, also they are going to find more time to work in different assignments from different classes. In addition, if they have more time for others classes their grades may increase, and they will have a better academic performance. To summarize, working in groups have a lot of beneficial aspects, students may grow as a person and develop different values when they work as a team, also they will learn more as individuals something that the new generation needs, students will also accomplish new things and be more successful.

35,817,CEFC32741811,"People who have self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I think that getting guidance from experts could help make decisions better because most people look and ask for guidance on a lot of things most of them are on decisions to make whether its a good or bad decision to make. I have asked people for guidance on decisions i remember i asked my old teacher if i should move to the U.S or stay in my country Generic_City. He told me that it would be better to move to the U.S because i would have more chances of being successful over there than staying in Generic_City and that i would have a better life too and that was one of the hardest decisions i have ever made in my life because i was leaving friends and family behind and i didnt want that to happen. I have been asked for help before, my friend one day she called me and asked me to help her on her relationship i could tell that she needed help and guidance i could her it in her voice they got into this argument and she told me that it wasnt the first time they have argued before and she told me that it got to this one point that it made her cry so i told her that she needs to break up with him and that he wasnt good for her and if she keeps dating him the arguments could get worse what if he starts getting violent with her and stuff. I told her that its going to be hard but its for the best. People ask for help when they need it or when they want it , However some people may not agree with me because they value their self-reliance and trust their instincts, they think that they should keep their personal problems to themselves but eventually those people are going to start having this feeling like they should talk about it to somebody and ask for their guidance because the same thing happened to me i didnt like telling people what was going on with my life later on i started feeling like i needed to talk to somebody about my decisions and i started to ask my family and friends for guidance.

36,818,092BBD374359,"""Hey I had fun reading this book with you"" , younger student said. Kids especially younger ones love the older students because they make everything cool and fun. Since some schools have a program where they pair up a younger and older student together to help both of them. The program could help both of them learn something cool, interesting and the older ones can learn how to assist a kid and could share different opinion that they cant share front of the teacher about learning. One way the program can help both younger and older student is by. They both can learn about something they have never learned or what they young want to learn about. Younger kids can teach the older ones how to say different stuff that they are learning. The older can each them what they are learning in class. This could be a mini deal that both have with each other and it could help. Another way the program can help both younger and older student is by. The older ones are almost ready for job. He could learn more about how to control a kid and teach them or assist them. The younger kid could tell them ways and teach them. This could lead to a good bounding with older students. I think they would see each other after years and be like I know who you are you were the one who assisted me. Last way the program can help both younger and older student is by.

37,819,526E417A97BD,"Many people tell me I have talent in soccer. For most of my years I trained to get better and better so I can become the best on my team. There were some faster players on my team and there still are. If you have ball control and skills you will be able to dribble past faster and stronger opponents. Also you will be able to hold the ball in your possession until someone opens up for a clear pass. Some skills I have are ball control, speed, agility, stamina, and dribbling. I developed ball control by practicing and watching professional soccer players play. My dad knows drills to gain ball control he taught me how to do them. Then I started doing those drills 3 times a week. I knew I was making progress because I was keeping more possession of the ball during my games and practice. I was able to keep possession of the ball until my teammates got open for a good position to receive the ball. Speed, agility, and stamina are some of the basic skills you need for this sport. For speed I did a lot of running, I would run at least 3 laps around the field for warm up with my brothers and dad. I also did many exercises for my leg muscles not too much weights because that would make my legs stiff. For agility I did some similar drills to the speed ones but faster movement and there are many different drills I also had to do with quicker pace. For stamina it was just a lot of running to get better at not getting tired too early and to be able to play for full 90 minutes of your game with enough energy. I enjoy doing drills for dribbling because its fun. My strongest skill in soccer is probably dribbling. I used to do a lot of drills for dribbling when I was new to the sport and I did more drills and got better and better each time. I would mostly play left mid because I was able to keep possession of the ball longer. Also when theres no one open to receive the ball or in a good position to receive the ball I would have to dribble through many players and I would go to the left corner so most of the defenders would come and try to get the ball leaving the striker open and making it easier for him to score and sometimes I dribble to the goal and try to score.

38,820,0381BBE47393,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree on what he said about us people always doing something will help us accomplish more. I will explain why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote about always being doing something. Even though it sounds like it is not a good thing i will give you my point of view of why it is important to always be active. First, one of the reason why it is important to be active doing something because you will accomplish more. For me i like to be busy because it will keep me focus,be determined, and keep me motivated. Being busy will help me finish my work or task i am doing. An example would be,i would rather be busy doing homework than just sitting around doing nothing and not being productive. You may have stress if your always busy but at the end it will always pay off. Second, another reason i agree on why always doing something helps you accomplish more is in time managing. Because you can not always be something and always finish it. People like to time manage so they can finish the work that will keep them occupied the most first. If your always doing something that you need to do it will keep you from doing stuff that will not benefit you. It is good thing to build time for other task you need to do then to just stay focus on one and not accomplish as much. Lastly, always doing something makes you a proactive person. Being lazy and not being a proactive person will affect you. Because you will not accomplish more than a person who is always doing something and is progressing in their own task they need to be doing. Always doing something is a good habit to have that will help you to always be successful. You will feel more proud of your self for the hard work you put in on your task for being always active on them. In conclusion, all those reason i talked about are reason why i agree on what Thomas Jefferson wrote, About it being a good thing that if we are always doing something we accomplish more. You will never have to worry about not doing a certain task you need to do if your always active and productive. People will not worry about them forgetting to do things if they are always busy and remembering to use their time management skill to help them.

39,821,F5D2D8C81370,"Cellphones should be allowed because that might help students to communicate with their parents if they have any kind of emergency while they are in school. It would be helpful for students to find any kind of information on internet when they forget their computers or other devices that they might use as a resource to find information. Another reason is that students will have the advantage to use their cellphones while they are in the middle of the class, and it means that those schools trust students that they use their cellphones properly during class and they are proving to others schools that student can be trusted to use their cellphones during classes. Students also can give an example to other students that cellphones are little machines that help us in everyday lives, and they also might be giving advice to students in how they can be benefited from chance that the school provides to them. On the other side why cellphones should not be allowed in schools is because schools think that students will not use their cellphones in a right path, and they will become more addictive to their cellphones where social media its included. Most of the population have shown that a big percent of the population use their cellphones to spend their time in social media, whether is Facebook, Twitter, and Instragram. Another percent of the population spend their time in YouTube which that YouTube brings us some advantage and disadvantage. The advantage might be the tutorials that can help us to find information, how to fix something that you are capable to repair, and how to provide some skills from something that you like. The disadvantage might be that people might spend too much time watching video games or a new episodes from their favorite comics characters. Another reason to not use cellphones in school is because when there is a fight between two students, they start to take pictures or videos of the fight rather than prevent and called anyone who can help. Most of the student will agree to have cellphones in schools because some of them use their cellphones in a right path and some of them do not. For those who use their cellphones in a properly way will say that cellphones are going to help them more than what teachers expect. Some of this students also will help them to find whatever meaning of a word that they do not understand. There are going to be some students who speak different language as their first language and it is very helpful to have cellphone while they are in school. For example some of the students who speak Spanish and they do not understand what the word say, they directly go to their cellphones and translate the word. Then they start to use it in some sentences to challenge themselves and improve their English. Those students who agree to have cellphones in school and do not accomplish the rules in how to use their cellphones properly, they will be playing around while they are in class, listen to music, and probably they will be texting with their friends. For some students will be annoying to have cellphones in class because it is going to be a distraction even if they are not using their cellphones. From other perspective teachers might believe that is wrong to have cellphones in class, whether they are using it in a proper way or not because they might believe that its a distraction for every students, and even if they are good students they will use their cellphones while teachers are explaining some important information. They also believe that some of them will use their cellphones to finish homework that is not for their class and will cause that students will not be paying attention in what the teacher is saying. Teachers also say that students will be texting in class and some of them playing video games and then when they tell them to put their cellphones away, they do not obey and some of them insult the teacher. Some teacher do not bother them if a student have a cellphone or not because they think that as long the student is doing his homework and classwork, they are going to be fine. I believe cellphones should be allowed in schools, but under supervision of the teachers and principles. One of the reason why I believe that should be allowed is because cellphones are very useful and helpful for me in many ways. In my situation I speak Spanish as my first language and when I do not understand a word I go to my cellphone and I translate the word and then I try to understand what the word means. I also use my cellphone when I do not have my computer with me, and I do my classwork with my cellphone, and then I turn my work in. But some students do not understand when they have to use their cellphones and when I see students listening to music it does distracted me because I am trying to concentrate in what the teachers is explaining because If I don not pay attention it is hard to understand later on. I also see how teachers get mad when a student do not obey when they have to put their cellphones away, and then the student start to argue with the teacher. I strongly agree that school should allow students to have cellphones because it does provide a lot of advantages.

40,822,DC33D5F69792,"In China we dont have the thing that Ralph Waldo Emerson. I know Ralph Waldo Emerson think he is grow up because he beyond he has already mastered. In my opinion people are different, so not everyone can grow up from beyond the things his already mastered. If they beyond the game that they already have play the best, they are not grow up. And there are three reasons I disagree about what Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote looking for new things and learn it make people grow, some small vital can make people grow up, and other vital matter can make people grow up. I am disagree with Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. People can look for new things and learn the things to grow up. The new things are not for human control. Students learn new things make their knowledge be more, they can grow up in this way. This is a example of my mom. When she first time can to America, she didnt know any English. She is learn English for three years, now she can talk a little bit English to other. Nobody can say she is not grow up, she learn a new Lagrange she never know before. In my mom story I know not the things you have already mastered in past make you grow up, the new things can make you grow up, too. People can have many small things that they dont care make they grow up. In a science experiment if you get a small mistake, the all experiment will be destruction by that little mistake. People who learn science, if they make that small mistake they will get their master abusive, nobody knows if the experiment will make people change. I think this is a big things will make people who learn the science grow up. They can control it is happened or not. In this example I learn the little things happen let they know the mall will become the big thing than it will bother you life. People can have many things in their life can make they grow up. When you go to the society, you will find it is so different between school and society. When you go to the work, you can feel effort is not the only choice, it is many way can get you go to the high lever. If you know this one, now you really become a adult. When you have a wedding with a girl. That will be you best time time, you grow up again. Then if you have a baby, you will get what is the really mean about responsibility. Responsibility make you get a word called grow up. Many things make people grow up the work, wife, kids, and other things make people really grow up. Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" It may work for Ralph Waldo Emerson or other people, but I disagree what he say. People are different, they have many different way to make they grow up, not the only way like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote. People can study new things to make their knowledge be more. They can learn the things from the small mistake that they made. They can grow up from society. In China it has so many reason make you grow up.",4,5,6,5,4,5,3111,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

44,826,A366CC7B0D05,"Are first impressions impossible to change? No, I believe that first impressions are not impossible to change because when you typically meet someone for the first time many people just try to "" fit in "" or be someone who they really arent but within time the perspective of how you are viewed can be changed and the first impression you made of yourself the first time wont matter. Also, when you first meet someone , typically you are nerves and you can be seen as a quiet and closed person when in reality you are really outgoing but it just takes you time to adapt to someone and many people dont act like themselfs. A example of why I disagree with ""first impressions being hard to change"" is because the first time I met my boyfriends mom I was really shy and nerves and I thought was giving off a bad vibe and making myself look "" bored "" even though I was just trying to be careful and not seem so crazy with what I said or did. After a while of me being around her she started to see me as a different person/much better person than i was and she started to see how outgoing I was and how I was nothing like the first impression I gave her and her view of me changed. Another example I have of how first impression can be changed is the from the first time i met one of my best friends. I first met her through a mutual friend we both had and when we got introduced to each other i thought she was annoying and that she could never be serious but with the time that went by I started to see how she really was and that was her personality and maybe i judged to fast. So when we started to become closer friends my first impression of her changed because now i love her and the first impression of her didnt affect me after all. So in conclusion , no , I dont think first impressions are almost hard to change. But it is also not something that can be changed within hours but with time the impression you give off can definitely be changed for the better or for the worse based on your actions as well.",8,7,8,7,7,7,2189,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
45,827,7600F1C7D884,"Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I personally dont think students would benefit learning from home because you can learn better by being taught face to face, being able to know the ideas of youre classmates, and from being around people who already know enough to help you out. Being homeschooled would be much less stressful than from actually going to school, but if you really want to learn and be a scholar, I think youd have a better chance going to school rather than learning from home because at home you can get distracted easily. Being taught face to face is so much easier becasue you can ask as many questions as you need to help you with your problem. also, I think your brain focuses more when youre being taught face to face than from learning through a computer. For me its so much easier to learn when being taught in person, because I concentrate more on the words the teacher is saying and when its through a computer I get distracted easily because theres no one around to tell me that I cant get up or go to the restroom. I remember this one time in math class I had an assignment I had to do and it was online, I could never understand it until I asked my teacher, personally, after that all the problems that were similar to that one probelm I couldnt figure out, I did them in seconds and I think thats because I was being taught face to face. When your in school youre never alone in a classroom because theres always other classmates and when youre homeschooled and its just you by yourself. I feel like being in a classroom full of other people is better than being at home and learning on your own. Having people around you while your in class isnt always as bad, I know some people get distracted easily and not concentrate while being around others, but sometimes its good to be around other people because you never know whose around and you dont know if the answer of one those people in your class can help you in any away. Me, personally, I enjoy working with others or even just having people around me, I feel less lonely like that and well I dont really get distracted as easily because I can talk to people and and at the same time concentrate on the work im doing, but thats just me i dont know how others are. Thirdly, going to school is actually fun, you meet new people and you dont have to be locked up in your house the whole day. In middle school I remember that I wouldnt talk to no one that worked at the school because I didnt trust them, until this day I still dont trust them but it wouldnt hurt you to be around them and ask questions about something you need. Having people around you who already have been through everything were going through is very helpful because they know the steps to help you feel better since theyve already been through it. Plus, you get more opportunities at school than learning from home, and thats because school can help you achieve youre goal and youre career, maybe not always but they can most definitely give you advice on what you can do to achieve youre goal. In conclusion, I think youd learn from home too, but you can learn more from school. This is to the people who homeschool their kids, wouldnt you rather have your kid at school where his safe, getting fed, getting his education, more opportunities on becoming someone in this world, and meeting new people in his life? or would you rather have him at home where his lonely and getting distracted easily? and it doesnt matter wether theyre the ones who want to be homeschooled because youre the parent and your in control not them.

48,830,D4490C9F73B9,"It has been said first impressions are almost impossible to change, but Im not agree with it because people always change and the first impression doesnt define who you are. The people always change to good or bad. For example, I met someone that in the first time I saw him he was mad, he never smiled, and he was very shy. And at the pass of the days he was changing, he started to smile, and he wasnt mad like the first time I saw him. Now my impression changes and now I can see that hes different and the first impression I had about him changed at all. Another example could be that in the first days of classes your teacher is nice, doesnt give you homeworks, and he is patient with the students. However, He is changing every day. Now hes always mad, now he gives you a lot of homework, and hes yelling in class. At this time, the first impression you had about the teacher totally changed because hes not the nice teacher that you met in the first days of classes. The first impression doesnt define who you are because first impression is like a front of a book and the front of the book is nothing comparable to the that is inside of the book. For example, I have some friends that told me that the first time they saw me they didnt like me because they says that Im always mad and I was a boy that dont talk with anybody just with my friends and they told me that they never thinked that Ill be their friend, but they were knowing me and they saw that I was different from their perspective and from the first time I met them, so they changed their first impression about me and their point of view about my personality. Another example, is that some people thinks that youre like they think just because they have a bad first impression about you. I mean sometimes we dont have good days and we are not like always. Lets go to suppose that in those days you met a person and youre having a bad day, youre mad, and with problems, so that person will think youre like that because that person will have a bad impression about you, but if that person have the time to know you better, he will see that youre not like he thinks you are just because the first impression about you is bad. If he is knowing you better, he will change his impression about you compare to the first time. Clearly, the first impression always is going to change because one impression doesnt define my personality and how I am and I can change that impression.

49,831,9FE689F5F44D,"Achieving the knowledge based on the books or on the notebooks is common but achieving a knowledge by involving in the extracurricular activities is a different and extra. School is the place where students get suggestion, get inspire, and get strength to accomplish their goals. From school, students can learn optimum knowledge and experiences about the inside and outside of the books as well. In addition, school is the career building place for the students. School is the best place to evaluate the skills and the capability of each students. By controlling students involvement in the extracurricular activities, many students can fulfill their dreams which gives them happiness and makes them feel special by doing it. Also, gives them a wings of hope to do something more and make their parents and themselves proud tomorrow. As we all know that, if the students doesnt have that ability and interest in order to take a particular class then school never force students to involve in those particular class or field. But, talking about family, there are maximum parents who force their children to take a class and choose a career as they want. There are many parents who wants their children to become a doctor, pilot or engineer; though, their children doesnt have any interest on that faculty. In other words, though their children are weak in math and science, but their parents wants to make them, a doctor, pilot or engineer. Its only because according to the parents, only doctor and pilot can make a huge money and has a great reputation. At this situation, we have seen many cases that parents do emotionally blackmail to their children. In that condition, children sacrifice their dreams just to make their parents happy. We all know, every student do not wants to become a doctor and pilot. They have their own dreams and interests on particular faculty. For example, if a student is interested and good on soccer but his parents do not support to his interest because they feel its a waste of time. But, school always support him. According to the parents their children should be good on knowledge based on books rather than extracurricular activities. They should have only focus towards their study which is totally wrong. If schools control student involvement in extracurricular activities then it can show a right path and right decision for the students bright future. Schools are available with each and every information regarding the bright future of students. If a student is interested on an art then teacher let them to take that class with a huge strength. School knows every skills and talent about their student because they spend more time with their teachers, counselor, friends and their coach than their family. In fact, they share everything about their interest to their teachers and counselors because they understand them. But they do not share those kind of things with their family because family gives only pressure instead of understanding their childrens interest. If a student is good on photography then school is the only one who gives more information and put more efforts to help them through different strategies. They try very hard that how students will feel easy and comfortable. Students are also able to learn different knowledge through the schools coach. Coach is the only one who teach, tell and motivate students about their strong and weak point through which student can do better today and give their best tomorrow than yesterday. School provides a beautiful and colorful feathers to the students in order to fulfill their dreams in which faculty they are interested and dying to do for it; only by controlling student involvement in extracurricular activities. There are many students who do not have any interest on their study, who do not have any interest on the words written on their notebooks, who do not have any interest to become a doctor, engineer or pilot. Instead, who are interested to become a famous photographer, to become a great dancer, singer and a great actor. These dreams will be remain on dream until they do not get any supports from anyone, if they do not get any motivators to motivate them and also if anyone wont become their inspiration to inspire and encourage them. Similarly, school is that place which do not give their students dream remain on dream; school helps students to give all those things which are needed to them; by motivating, encouraging and being inspiration for the students. It also provides an elective classes and other different activities to make them feel happy and special or in order to let their colorful feathers fly in the high sky and able to touch and feel it. At the end, we can see that there are many benefits for the students which also teach them about the importance of extracurricular activities. Therefore, school is that place where it motivate, gives a strong strength to accomplish students passions, suggest students to go through their interest and teach many significance knowledge about the educational experiences. Because of the schools control student involvement in the extracurricular activities, students can accomplish their interests, dreams and make their career in a particular activity in which they are interested, in which they see a big hope, declare it as their passion and happiness. I believe that not only the students, everyone should follow their passions and see success will comes towards you itself because all we need is our happiness. It is only possible if the schools control students involvement in the extracurricular activities rather than giving decisions to the family and student for the involvement in the extracurricular activities.

It is important to fall down and dont loose our hope because that hope and the enthusiasm make us better persons and that is our impulse to succeed and make our dreams real.

57,839,95FD6DF25420,"Hi my name is Generic_Name and I am going to talk about energy and resources. The reason why we are talking about energy and resourses is because ,some busineses have adopted a four day work week. They want to because they want to conserve energy and resourses. Each work week is going to be for 10 hours but in my opinon that is not going to work. I think it is not going to work because, people are barely working 8 hour shift and working 10 hour shifts. It is going to be more painful for people, and they are going to get really tired. In my opinion if they are going to make people work for 10 hours for 4 days, they have to increase the minumim wage and pay a little bit more money. Their is alot of reason why I do not agree with this new change. The only positive reason I see is getting 3 days off. Another positive reason I see for this change is, if you get payed every 2 weeks, and you worked 4 days and, make 40 hours 1 week and 40 hours another week, it is going to be a good paycheck. Now it depends how much you get payed but im pretty sure if you are going to do 10 hours shifts, they are atleast going to pay $12.00 an hour or they are going to pay you $11.00 dollars in hour. Those would be good reasons to work in a job like that. It depends to if the people have time to work 10 hour shifts for 4 days. Their are some school that want to have those same rules that some jobs have of 10 hours. I do not think that would work for students, because 10 hours of being in school is really stressing. I know how it feel like to be in school for 8 hours, is it is not fun and it is really stress full. I think that the classes in highschool would be more longer the students would not concentrate .The reason they would not concentrate is because, you would be doing a lot of asighnments and, you would lose intrest in what they are teaching and, you would lose focus. In my opinion I would not like that but I am pretty sure the school would like it because, they would be completing more work and they would be finishing lessons really quick and the students would study more. There would be another advantage to that because the students would be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week. They would have 3 days off every week that in my opinon it would propably be friday saturday and sunday. It would sound kind of good since you get 3 days off every week, but at the same time no students want to be in school for 10 hours for 4 days a week ,that sounds stressing and hard .You would propably have more classes, a lot of home work ,and more test, and quizes. It would propably be hard for teachers to do 10 hour shift to because ,they would have to do more planings of lessons because they would propably have to teach lot of classes during the day since the school day is 10 hours. In my opinion this prompt that I wrote today was really intresting. The topic was really intresting it made me think a lot of what I was going to type in this prompt. The topic was really intresting because it was about what I thought about jobs only working 4 days a week and 10 hour shifts. The other part of the topic was what if school was 4 days and 10 hours. This prompt made me put myself in that position and I did not like it if this would ever happen in real life I would be against it .

Not everyone agrees that a person can grow after they have already done what they needed. However I agree because people grow by trying new things, people succeed by trying new things, and gain more experience. Many people grow by trying new things. When people work beyond what they know they try new things. Trying new things can help them grow in many ways. People who try new things may know their job better and work harder. In addition people will get better at what they do. They will have more experience then others and know their surroundings. Many people may succeed when they try new things. People will become more successful. They will know what has to be done and what does not because they have worked hard and know better. In addition they will know their way around. They will not need much help because they have done the work and grew to be better. Finally people gain more experience. When people work beyond they will be more experienced. They will have more experience then others and help others when they need the help. People will be more educated in that topic and help others. While many people think you can not grow. There are a lot of people who are probably growing because they went beyond to learn. Unless you do not do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. In conclusion people who go above and beyond grow because they have done more to help them grow and become better and to succeed. You should try and go beyond and see if you grown.

59,841,A91103F63B19,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle ... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". We tend to persevere when we are used to doing something for a long time but if you dont do anything how will u accomplish and persevere in anything? However been idle doesnt necessarily mean we are incapable of persevering forward, it just means that we lack the spirit to accomplish our goals or dreams. Your inactivity in life doesnt serve a purpose at all in your life instead it serves as your downfall and your weakness in persevering. People who persevere to accomplish their goals or dreams always end up changing their lives for the better instead of the worst. Like Lionel Messi he didnt give up on his dreams to become a world star athlete because he couldnt walk upright and was always bending over, he continued playing despite been different from everyone else he played with. He played and showed how energetic he was in accomplishing his dream of becoming a world class soccer player. And today hes one of the worlds Best and richest soccer players in the world today. He showed that even if you have tried and cant persevere through your goals or dreams, the little effort you put in can do a drastic change in your life. Its amazing to see how much we have done in te last two hundred years pertaining to technology. We didnt do all that by standing around and been idle but by always pesevering to accomplis something greater for ourselves and our society and to move forward. we have created electricity, telephones, telegraph, airplane, motorcycle, automobile and more. we created so much that it pushes us forward to be better people. But the most important one we discovered was electricity because more than half of what we use today uses some form of electricity. We have created so much that people would not be idle but there are still idle people. Not everyone who perseveres comes from a poor family or had a terrible life when they were little or was disabled, people can persevere where ever they are from. They can persevere even if they look, talk or act different from everyone else as long as they have a strong spirit and a strong will to move ahead and be a better person than they were before nothing can stop them.

60,842,025722D0AFB7,"Now a days most employers are looking for specific characteristics in potential employees. They look for someone who is responsible, hard-working, humble, and kind. Someone who is going to be a role modle for the company, and also for the community. Commonly, they look for a person who has experience, specially with costumer service. When the company decides to hire someone with all of these characteristics, the company is going to increase its sales, more costumers are going to visit the location, and they are going to be happy with the service provided. I belive that by having a good behavior and showing our values and manners, we are representing our families, and who we really are. Manners and values play a big role when hiring an employee. When communicating with costumers there has to be mutual respect. Responsability is also really important. Showing up to work on time, with a clean uniform and a possitive attitude, is a way to show responsability and respect to the company. Therefore, by working hard and staying true to your self we are going to help make work a better place. A role model is kind, humble, learns from its mistakes every day, as well as to be a better person at work and outside from work. An employee is a role model for the community, and also it represents the company. As we all know, work can be hard sometimes, so it is important to ask for help when needed. By doing this we are creating a comfortable atmosphere for costumers to feel like home and to feel welcome. Eventually, sales are going to increase and the company is going to make more money. Most teenagers my age dont have that much experience in any jobs. Mostly because theyre too young, and the jobs they apply for recures at leas 1 or 2 years of experience. However, I think that at least we should get an opportunity to get the job, because no one would ever know how good we can be if we dont get an opportunity. In my past experience, Ive worked before with as a cashier. Im also respectful and responsible. I take my job really serous and I dont like to play games. Im a straight forward person, who belives that if employees are good to the costumers, more and more people will visit the location and the bussines will show more growth. I highly belive that I am a good candidate for this position. For me it is really important to have manners and values, specially inside work. To treat people with kindness and respectfuly. Also to be responsible, and something that is really important for me is to work hard to get what i want. When i go to a restaurant or to a store, I like to feel welcomed, so that why I treat costumers the way how i like to be treated. In advance, i will like to say the importance of being a role model for our generation, We are the future of this world and we have to make good decitions every day.

Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school dont have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they dont have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they wont be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students dont live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",5,4,5,5,6,5,1133,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

I think it is a good idea to change to a new,healthier school lunch menu. First of all,if students received healthier lunch, its going to help them a lot. For example, it would made students to be on task and be focused in their classes. The will help students to get good grades and to keep students active in all their classes. Changing school lunch menu will have a big impact in students, more people will start to get food and its going to help their brain to think more. My second reason is students prefer good food than healthier food the taste nasty. In addition, mostly all students would prefer to eat regular food the is healthier. However,it doesnt have nothing to do with your body if you dont want to be fat because of the food you received, thats because you dont care about your body. Students will have to start worrying about their body not about the food they eat. My last reason is about the benefits of receiving healthier school menu at school. For example, students will enjoy more their lunch. students would choose what to eat and students would have time to interact with theirs friends while they eat their lunch. In conclusion, i think is a good idea for school to change the lunch menu. Students are going to focused more and students would be on task in school.",6,6,5,4,4,5,2327,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The frist thing is the enviroment, most people play outside and others play inside, well I think you should play outside mostly on summer days because the enviroment is more cooler or warmer than other months. The second thing you should do is to try not to play in extreme temperature. The thrid thing is make sure its not high winds outside to be cold, this will effect your gameplay for basket ball if its high winds. Fourth thing is the good days to play basket ball, like summer days or sping time.

Equipment is important for basket ball, so here some things you would need for basket ball. The frist thing is a basket ball, make sure the ball is full of air and a frim grip. When play basket ball make sure the court is large enough for the sport. The court need to be a flat surface for the basket ball not to roll off. The next thing is a pole for the basket, make sure the pole is high enough for the basket and the ball to reach. The basket needs to be wide enough for the ball and a net that is short enough for the ball. The last thing for equipment is the out line of the court, it needs the out line for lineing up shots. The skill of basket ball is important because of the gameplay is to win the game. Fitness is important for basket ball because it can bring up your stamina.

I think students will highly benefit from atending classes from home. Because not everyone learns the sameway. some students struggle to stay in school all day and, most of them cant listen to teachers talking for 90 minutes straight. I feel like less students will drop out of high school. Some students are anti social and, dont like being in a place where everyone likes to judge you or, talk about you. Students dont have to stressed out about work that is not finished in class so, homework will be a thing in the passed. People like me will have more time to play sports and, be with family.

The future are our computers and, builting a strong skill with computers is a great treat to have. Online classes is the future and the future is here.

72,854,7A68E1FB7863,"Imagine an aboard student come from different country that is far away from United State, so she need a long summer break to return to her country for visit her family. Summer break is what educators and students are looking forward for. Whereas many people argue that the break should be year-round schools, and it should be a 3-4 week break in summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. The summer break should be longer and less short break because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. While many people believe that the summer break should be shorten, a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall because the educators feels that if the break too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall, this is a week argument. For instance, a break in the middle of the school year easy to get students forget what they have learn. Further more, students will not want to go back to school after few days off. Students need break but a short break is unnecessary. To begin with, students are waiting for a long summer break where they can spend all their time at the place that they wish to be at. For example, an exchange student from Vietnam came to United State with her parents for emergrates, but her siblings still live in Vietnam because they were married before sign up. Summer break is the only time that allows the student to go back to her country for visiting. Furthermore, some students are working full time in summer to have a provision for their consumption in the future such as buying a car, college,etc. The part time work that students make during school year does help but not much for preparing or satisfy the claim inside teenager. In addition, people want to have a relax time on a long vacation, none of the students want to be thinking that they still have work waiting for them at home and the deadline is coming. For instance, teachers love give homework during the break for no reason. Going out with friends but still have to bring paper and pencil to do homework is very humor. Furthermore, some teacher put onerous on students, which they giving out homework and big project for a test grade just because they dont want the student to forget the information that they have learn. Students didnt expect teachers to finish grading their work during the break, but teachers expect them to finish the big project, it is unfair for students. As a final point, the summer break should be longer because students need more time for their vacation, and they will not have to worry the homework that they left at home. For long summer break teacher dont give homework, and students feel free to plan out their vacation for entire summer. The long break is much better than a short and unnecessary break.

People who make their own decisions they know the consequences, but they know how to grow up as a person, and beat up any problem that they have. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for advices because older people seems to have more experience in some topics. First, people who made mistakes in life, they need to learn how to not made that mistake again. If someone is there just telling people what to do and what not to do, people will never learn how to not made that mistake again. Sometimes, it is good to ask someone for some help, but they do not have to tell them exactly what do. If someone need help in something, they need to paid close attention, and see how is that person doing something. Due to the fact that many people made mistakes, they have to learn how to do decisions by themselves. Second, people who has been guided by their parents, but their parents are not with for them. Since their parents are not with them, and there is difficult time where some people will need the help of their parent, but because they was use to it, that their parents do everything for them, they will never know what to do. Because of that, people will never know how to get up and do everything by themselves. Sometimes, it is easier just to ask someone how to do something, but sadly one day they will be in the same situation, and they will never know how solve it. Third, people who make their own decisions in life they already know the consequences, but they know how to beat them and grow up as a person.

For example, I am planning to be a photographer soon, with that I had to go through many steps in getting the equipment that I needed. Also I needed to figure out all of the techniques of a camera, through all of that their has always been times where I failed to complete my task. Either their were problems with my camera or with my lighting just problems that I didnt know how to function well enough. Well with all of that I learned from my mistakes now, I know of what and not to do with my camera. Im still learning new techniques since I started about a year ago, Im still somewhat new but I plan to do this for a couple years and make a career out of it When we try to pursue a career or even just trying to figure out the simplest problem that we have, we will all at one point in our lives get a answer to that problem or issues that you have. Thats why failure is a key part to success, if you dont learn from your mistakes how will you learn. For example, when I was in middle school my teacher always picked on me in class the reason behind it was because I didnt play my instrument the right way. Well now I thank him for teaching me and instructing me how to play my instrument the correct way. Now I have improved over the past years and play the saxophone in my senior year. In Conclusion, their will always be ups and downs in life, in all of these examples that I have given you they have all impacted my life in a good way.

In my hands I will have a advantage over people that starting to be a photographer, they will make the same mistakes as I made but they will recover from it.

Kids, parents, and teacher have other things to do, they all have plans and will get in the way of that. One of the reasons why i disagree with extanding the school day is that kids will not have enough time to do other activities, for example after school programs, clubs, and practice. If the school board adds another hour kids will get so caught up on homework that will not have enough time to other activities Kids need a distraction from school, although school is really important, kids needs to distract their minds away from everything in school, like test, wetheater or not they failing, drama, all the stress schools brings sometimes. They just a rest from everything, they need a ""stress free"" time. Kids needs time for themselfs, time to do something thats not always school. Kids, parents, and teachers do other acitivites after school, for example kids go to football practice right after school or pian lessons, they might not be able to go. They can have doctors appointment, since some kids get appointments late in day so they wont miss a day in school. Parents needs to go places with their kids at a specifc time, and if they come late and kids will be too tired to go with them. Teachers got palns, they need to do stuff after school, maybe their kids has a game, or they need to go to their kids rehersal and if school board extends a day, teacher would not be able to go because they are working, maybe some teachers studies after work, or they do homework if they in collage. Adding one more hour to school can ruin everyones schudule. In conclusion extending each school day can be a big change with time for everyone. Kids needs time for themself, they need distraction away from school and the time its left for them to have a free time it might be nothing since they will be in school and then do homwork.

81,863,BE4764F7BFF1,"The Downside of Online Classes A couple of schools offer online classes through virtual videos and video conferencing for students to take from home. Some schools might think that students would benefit from this and others think that this is not a good idea. From my perspective, students would not benefit from taking online classes for many reasons such as; they could get distracted easily, they miss out interacting with teachers and students, and they would eventually get bored of online school at home. To begin with, many students K though 12th grade get distracted easily. The distraction is not because we dont want to do the work, but its our minds. Everyones minds work in a different way and theres always going to be that part of us that gets distracted by the small things around us. Also, technology is somewhat of an issue because it distracts many people because of the games and many apps that it has. Students could go off task and go off playing games or watching videos while they are supposed to be learning and doing their work online. For example, sometimes even I get distracted while doing my work at home through my computer or smart device because of the many other things I could be doing instead of doing homework. There are many distractions online and around us that could make us go off task instead of keeping us focused to do our work. Furthermore, many students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff. In other words, when you are taking online classes the only person there with you would be your teacher, whom is communicating with you through your computer. No one else would be there with you to help you through it, everything would have to be on your own. Ultimately, if you are in a school many teachers and students would be there to assist you with any questions or concerns that you might have. Also, you would miss out on a lot more exciting events such as school dances, football games, and pep rallies. There is so much that you would miss out if you wouldnt go to a public school and decided to take online school instead. Ultimately, you would also be spending almost all day in your house because of online classes. A regular school day is about 8 hours, meaning the online classes would be about the same time , or more or less. In school 8 hours is already tiring enough because of the learning and listening, but think of 8 hours at home with no breaks in between, that would be extremely exhausting. Almost all students that attend school come for a full 8 hour day, which includes break in between classes, then once school is over they go back home to be able to relax. If you are at home for 8 hours doing work, you wouldnt want to spend time relaxing at your home because eventually it would get boring there after a while. In my experience being at home gets boring to the point where I dont know what else to do to not be bored at home. In other words, being in the same place for a whole day would get boring and uncomfortable. On the other hand, other schools claim that it is a good idea for students to take online classes. They are in favor of taking online classes through video conferencing. Some of the schools think that online classes are a good idea because many students could possibly avoid drama, get 1 on 1 assistance, and learn quicker. Although some of it is true, online classes should not be necessary. Online school should only be necessary if a student does not feel safe at their school because of personal reasons. Overall, online classes are not a good idea at all unless it is necessary because of safety issues. Besides that, it would not be a good idea because many students would get distracted when they are supposed to be doing work, students would miss out on interacting with other students, teachers, and staff, and they would spend most of their day at home which is unhealthy.",10,9,8,8,9,9,2562,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 10"
82,864,1736153EF81F,"Well, I feel that working with a group is better than working alone. In my opinion is more easy to work with other people and you can be sociable working like that ,theres a lot benefits and reasons why I prefer more work together than work alone. Let me explain what are my reasons why I prefer work in a group and why I dont like to work alone. First of all, I prefer work together because is more easy and you can finish your work quicky. For example, is you work in group of three, one member can search for the information about the topic, another member can make a poster showing examples about the topic and the last one has to organize how they are going to present and explain the topic. However, if I work alone I have to do all the work by my own, and it can takes a lot time to finish the project. Second of all, Working together is so funny you can talk with your classmates about the topic, and having good discussions. I feel comfortable working in a group and I enjoy working like that, because they share their opinions with you, even you can learn more from your classmates than the information of the topic, it can be strange,but it is true you dont know how much they know about the topic. Sometimes you cant understand the topic, but you have your group and ask questions to them, and they can help you to understand the topic. Third of all, Working in groups can be sociable, you can have a good time knowing new people and make new friends. I think is good be sociable because you can learn new things about them and you can develop your knowlege getting the new information from your classmates. For example, if you dont know anythink about history and you are in a group, and you ask who knows something about history and someone likes history you can aks him about it, and you can get new information about history and at the same time you are being sociable. However, if you are working alone, you cant ask to anybody because you dont know them. In conclusion, thats are the reasons why I prefer working in a group. Working together can be easy you can share the work with your group, you can have a good time with your classmate talking about the topic , and you can develop your friendship making new friends.",7,6,7,5,6,7,323,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

84,866,DA1ABE125640,"Working in group Sometime working alone can be hard, because by working alone you cant know your class mates and then you dont have any friends to work. So students should work in group, Although, working with group is more beneficial because you can know more about your class friends, can have fun during work and you can divide work in group. First reason, why working in a group is more beneficial, because you can know more about your class friends. There are many students that come from other countries or other school so they should work in group. It is good idea to show for those students that come from other countries they will love to know the way they work in class and it is great for English learner because By working in group you have to talk more then work. In group work students can help each other as friends explains something to each other. Another reason, why working in group is more beneficial, because you can have fun during group activity. Like working on project is fun when you have group, because every person have different idea and when as a group you put all ideas together it is going to be very interesting and by working in group you can increase your knowledge. There are many fun activities in classes that students should work in group like you can debates to other groups on any class topic. That turn a boring topic into fun topic so that way students can also work happily. Finally, why working in group is more beneficial because you can divide work in groups that way students can complete work on time. students can focus more than working individual. They think it is kind of challenge to them against other groups. that way they give their best to work and complete assignment on time. Students can study as a group for test they can make some quizzes for their group to study for test that way they can do better in test. Working in a group is important to students and it has many benefits. Many people do jobs with different kinds of experience people and they work as a groups they get many benefits in group work. So it is great for students to work in groups and to learn many new thing from other students. So thats why working in a groups is beneficially.

85,867,68004683BC3C,"I Disagree the school board is adding one and half hours each day of school. We have regular school days seven hours a day. Also some people stay afterschool that palce two more hours of school. That is nine hours of school. I usally stay afterschool for peer helpers every wenesdays. That helps me to get my communite servers up I already have six hours, I just need nine more hours that is it. But either way I love helping special kids and also I will love to finish this year helping PROPER_NAME, even though Im about to finish my community severs hours I will still help the kids. Anyways this about me disagreeing with school borad. What Im really trying to say we wake up at six oclock or five oclock and we come to school and we do our work. Some of as have good grades and some of as are trying our best. We recpect our teachers as much as we could, we do our work and we some how understand what the teacher gives us. Also we try our best as we could. Another example that you cant add more hours to our school is that some students have sports afterschool not in school out of school. Even though there is sports in my school they already sign up for other sports. Some students wants to just go home and be in her/she home and just study quietly instead of afterschool, afterschool is every loudly its not for everybody. All of us have good examples and they will tell why its a bad idea and they will disagree with you. But I know where you guys are coming from you want us to have more education. I really hope you dont add more hours because seven hours is enough for us to learn. We got other things to do afterschool. If you add more hours, students will be picked up every last period and not even be there when the teacher is teaching. Also we will not have afterschool activity because students cant stay afterschool past six oclock. Also if you add more hours parents will take out their childern and they will put them in a different school. That what I think about you adding more hours to school. I hope you think about it and think about if your idea we are actally taking benfits. Why I disagree with school board is wrong that you guys are adding more hours of school. For example, like I said I stay afterschool on wendesdays and seven hours of school place the two more hours for afterschool. It gives me headace and our late bus is the last one to go, so basically I go home five oclock and sometime when the late bus comes early I go home like 4:48pm. When I go home I eat and take a shower I watch for a little bit I say Im take a nap it doesnt end up a nap it ends up I wake up at six oclock. Also sometimes when I dont stay afterschool, I take nap at home I wake up at eleven oclock, I go to sleep at three oclock.

Some people are influenced by friends 2. Everyone has their own life traits 3. Not everyone has bad traits I believe everyone in this world has their own choice of traits but, their are some other people who are influenced by others which include, Friends,family, even people who dont know you well and dosent wanna see you succeed and can hold you back your traits. But therefor theres people who follow their own good traits witch will lead you to a better and a successful life. Last but not least not everyone has bad traits some people will have a good influence on you witch could be good deed and take you the right way it all depends on you how you well your mind process to find out if its bad or good for your life. 1. I believe everyone in this world had their own trait of living some have good deed but some negative for example, bad traits can come from friends, family, even people not close to you i believe that because not everyone is raised with a happy living families which lead them to a bad trait of how they grew up but, on the other hand some are raised with a happy family which gave that person a good deed of living with good traits but again that could be ruin for you if you spending time with someone with bad traits. 2. Therefore everyone in the world has their own trait for Example people with success in life having big beautiful house and expansive cars had good traits which have lead them to a better life for the next generation but on the other hand bad traits will lead you to nothing but a bad life and negative traits and if you become friends with them and you had good trait you are being influenced and controlled by someone else, Some other traits can come from your relationships like if you have a girlfriend thats the worst influence that could change everything in your life and some can break you apart mentally but some can take you the right way examples of a bad relationship arguments,blaming yourself,hurting each other with actions. that could leave you with a scar you cant heal from and can bring bad traits for your future. 3. Last but not least not everyone is controlled and influenced by others because for example smart people, people will try to put you on negative deeds if you have a successful life they will hate and will try anything to take you off your path dont let any bad influence get to them and understand the fact they are trying to ruin your life, you have to step up for yourself and stay away from the bad influence that could control you and lead you a negative path my advise for the people who feel like they are being influenced and are controlled what you choose your character to be thats how your gonna be and how your gonna live so think to yourself and say what your traits are a negative or a positive.",6,7,7,6,8,8,1159,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
88,870,6DA4157C9B4F,"Many people believe that self-esteem comes from achievement. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. True self-esteem comes from achievement because accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder, help you praise yourself, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember. Accomplishing a goal pushes you to try harder. This is important because achievements comes from all your goals you have accomplished and that helps you want to try harder and to achieve many other goals you might have that you want to achieve. This helps you build self-esteem by making you feel good for what you have accomplished. Also since it makes you feel good it helps you want to accomplish other things because it makes your self-confidence grow stronger. Also achievement helps you praise yourself. What this means is praising yourself inspires you to continue to do many other things. Praising yourself keeps you wanting to keep on achieving your goals. It is like an inspiration because you know that after any achievement you are going to praise yourself and that is going to make you feel good. So praising yourself makes you have a higher self-esteem by helping you feel good within yourself. Moreover, achievement is a long lasting satisfaction. For example, you have jsut achieved a goal youve had for three years now it makes you feel very satisfied that you finally made it. Eventhough some may think satisfaction on something you achieve is not important you should because satisfaction with yourself makes your self-esteem go up. satisfaction is a result of an achievement and a achievement helps you be more confident with yourself. Achievement is the key to higher self-steem because it pushes you to try harder, helps you praise yourself a little more, and it is a long lasting satisfaction for you to remember. If you want to have higher self-steem then achievement is the key. ",6,6,8,7,9,8,1434,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
89,871,FB5F33FEC99F,"Did you know that participating in after school activities or clubs benefits students educational wise? Weather its joining a sports team, or theater art, or even practicing an instrument, they all educate you in a way. There are many activities that arent just educational, but students will also find enjoyable, such as sports, art and music. There are many types of sports, football, basketball, soccer and many many more to choose from. Sports teaches you a lot about health, and why its important to stay healthy. It also helps you stay fit and in shape. Playing sports can also give you a scholar ship for collage, but all that a side its also fun and enjoyable. You get to hang with your friends, compete with other schools and teams, carry the schools name, and most importantly win trophies and receive rewards. At some schools, they even let you go on field trips to other states to fields and courts to compete with other teams. Its nice to have so many people come and support you and cheer you on at games, even when it gets competitive. Drawing, painting, doodling or crafting are all ways of art. Some students have a hard time expressing their feelings, so they do it through art. They express their feelings and emotions through the colors and the designs and subliminal messages they hide in their paintings. Art clubs get to go to art museums and art gallerys that inspire and improve their talent. They even get to do art competitions and win prices and art gallerys of their own to hang on the walls around the school. Painting or Drawing your mood is one way to enjoy yourself and become more passionate for the talent you have. Art is very deep, interesting and meaningful,yet many people dont really understand art that much. Its fun to experiment with colors and textures, for art has no limit. Many students join bands and music clubs simply because they enjoy playing or singing. There are many different types of instruments to choose from, like band and string, but they are very different. bands do not include string instruments, nor do string instruments include band. Singing is also one of the ways students like to have fun and enjoy themselves, as well as playing there favorite instrument. Music is also art and a talent that not most people really have. students get to go to operas concerts and very famous theaters to meet very famous musicians. They also get to preform on stages and before every school game, they also get to compete in music competitions were they get to earn and receive valuable rewards. They also get to upgrade their instruments every year to the finest quality. In conclusion, There are many activities that arent just educational, but also very enjoyable, like sports, art and music. Learning should not be all serious, strict and stressful,but should be fun, enjoyable and lovable. Education is important, but loving to learn is more important to sussed. These activities and clubs teaches students something new everyday and helps in developing the brain skills. Education is fun but sometimes its good to be serious, or strict in some situations.

92,874,1F4961D46D29,"Imagination Over Mind Imagination its what sparks our creativity. Without imagination, knowledge means nothing because we wouldnt be able to come up with anything. How we create intricate characters and stories and how incredible buildings stand tall. This is due to imagination and how we come up with such things. Take a second and think of your favorite character from any source of media. They were created because someone imagined them and brought them to life. Imagination is all around us from our stories and music to our basic everyday items. That pen on your desk was imagined up to be able to write and pass along information. For ages people imagined stories and people listened. People and imagined plays,movies,books,TV and video games all with different stories and design. These things may seem insignificant, but people adore these stories and have been inspired. They have been mesmerized by these worlds and characters. Imagination is what leads people to create these stories. These stories have taught us messages and life lessons also. They inspire us to be best version of our self and to follow our dreams, as we see the characters do. We grow close to characters and relate with them, making these stories more special to us. Imagination gave us inspiring role models and heroes, they also gave us a childhood. How we wait to see our favorite cartoon and smile with excitement waiting for the next adventure to unfold. Imagination gave life to unforgettable characters, how Walt Disney created Micky Mouse and countless other. These characters and stories arent just for children but adults as well. Stories of all genres exist to bring new experiences and worlds to the audience. Imagination gave us stories to inspire,scare,to make us laugh or even cry for the character. Imagination gave life to countless of stories something knowledge could never do alone. From the Eiffel Tower to an small little house, people imagined buildings and ways to construct them. Its true you need to understand and know how to build but imagination is more important. Imagination is what let us think of such designs. Even in ancient times people put imagination and knowledge to build a house. Whether its building a mud house or straw hut people imagined putting all of it together and put it in action. How people designed cars for transportation and made it function properly. Engineers are creative and imaginative to come up with such intricate designs and models. Even everyday objects were imagined and made to help you in everyday life. Whether its a juicer to a wrench, people imagined these things to serve a purpose. How biomechanics creates prosthetic arms and legs to help the disabled to move again. Theses things all started as thought to help society and now are a vital part in today society. Imagination is what led man kind to create items to help us in everyday life. Music is an form of art where people express their emotions through song. Instruments were imagined for the sole purpose to create art. Then playing the instrument led to more creative thinking, then songs were imagined and instruments added to that. Songs are written with heart and they express the artists emotions. They are imagined and written down, sometimes using metaphors to express their emotions. People say that they can say things through music that they couldnt say with words. Being able to imagine such meaningful songs that leave a such an impact on the listener is incredible. Music speaks to people in a way words cant and the artist that make them are imaginative people. Imagination led these artist to produce such songs and music. Painting is an other form of imaginative art. These artist express themselves by using strokes of paint to produce vibrant works of art. Even though a painting is silent people speak through them to show such meaningful works of art. Artists imagine what they want to paint and execute and you can see such a passion in their works of art. Imagination inspires artist to create outstanding pieces of art. Imagination also expresses itself in the way we dress and life style. For the most part we choose the way we dress,where we work and what we do. When not in uniform or work clothes we choose how we dress. We imagine ourselves a certain way and choose to expresses ourselves that way. Our hair and how we choose to style it also reflects our personality. Whether its colored,straight,curly or even no hair at all. We also imagine what we want in our lives and choose to study for that career. Our hobbies and interest also show what kind of person you are. How you spend your free time is how you reflect yourself. Our appearance and hobbies are a self reflection of our imagination and who you are. Imagination makes you who you are, and thats what makes everyone a different person. Imagination might not seem important but its what allows people to create stories, construct buildings, create items,produce music,to make art and makes you. We need imagination even more than we need knowledge. Without imagination there wouldnt be a way to put our knowledge to use. Imagination is the fuel of the world, its what keeps everything going. It may seem insignificant at first but imagination is so such more. Without imagination no advancements would be made. We need imagination to do almost everything life.

In those years, Generic_Name has proved his apprenticeship by taking classes in the school. More often his grades are the higher in the class, and his teacher is glad that he still going to her class. Learning in school with a teaher next to him was important for Generic_Name to get those grades. Teachers believe that students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because it makes students attention lower, and they do not learn as the same way. Firstly, student would not benefit from begin able to attend classes from home because it makes students attention lower. For example, Generic_Name wants to get out of school next week, yet he wants to takes classes online, but his teacher told him that is not the best option for him. This example shows that the teacher is telling Generic_Name dont take classes online, it would not benefit his attention at classes in the same way that school does. Even though, Generic_Name thinks that is the best idea, at the same time is not because the only way to dont lose his attention at classes is to continue the school. Thus, attend classes from home is not going to benefit a student attention. Secondly, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they do not learn as the same way. For example, Generic_Name is a student of a New Yorks school, his teacher says that when he started classes online he did not learned as the same way that he used to do at school. This example shows that when Generic_Name did not continue classes in school he started to have problems with the topics because students can not learn in the same way that in school. For Generic_Name was not important learn properly in home or school, but for his teacher yes becuase they knew already that it would not benefit learning in the same way. Thus, distance learning is not the best option fro a student. On the others hand, some people believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. It is true, it can be possible when a student do not speak the language, and his/her parents prefer that the student take classes online. However, still proof that students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home. For example, the teachers of Generic_Name and Generic_Name say that distance learning does not help students to improve their attention and apprenticeship. Thus, it can benefit students the classes online in 20%, but the classes in schools benefit students in a 100%. In conclusion, to restate the point students would not benefit attend classes from home. The first reason is because it makes studentss attention decrease. Further, students are not going to learn in the same way that they used to do in school. However some people believe that taking classes online from home will benefit to the students. Thus, coming to school is the best way that is going to benefit the students to attend in classes. ",6,6,5,5,5,6,1250,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

98,880,BA6FC6ECE68E,"Some school districts have been offering programs that are allowing high school students to graduate a year early instead of the regular four years. In my opinion most students who agree with this and actually want to graduate a year early just do it to get school out of their way. They choose to take courses in the summer than a nice trip to a beach or hang out with some friends. I mean who wouldnt want to graduate a year early right? but in the end its not even worth it. I know that school may not be all fun and games but all that education and knowledge sure does take you far in life. Graduating a year earlier than your other classmates doesnt make you more than them, it doesnt make any student seem smart, its just them taking the short cut to end school. I believe it isnt a good idea for students to graduate a year early. I say this because senior year just brings more new experiences to your life. Also you get more opportunities to get a little taste of a few colleges when they come to the schools. You get help with your resumes, and just things that prepare you for a good future. Senior year is the ""best"" year as some students say. Graduating a year early, just makes you miss all those nice and fun experiences with friends, including the activities the school does that last year. Some students may not agree with this but senior year just gives you that extra push into making your future better. The last year of high school is like the guide to the beginning of your new life as an adult with more goals to be accomplished. Another reason why I dont think its a good idea for students to just take the ""easy""way out is because some students just do it to end their school life. I believe that the students whod want to graduate a year earlier would be the ones who skip class, dont do their work, are always late to school and so on ,but to make it clear I was just referring to the bad influenced kids. High school isnt a race and neither is who has the best things in life because those you earn them by your hard work. Some students end up not even going to college, they just go straight into the workforce. Being one of those students who get to graduate a year early, it literally doesnt make you cool. I personally think that going straight to the workforce isnt the best option because to be honest, they just end up working in a Chick-fil-A, McDonalds, Burger King and all those jobs that dont even pay well. An education can get you a job! A job thatll pay you well and something that you know youll have as a secure job and not having to change every other month or every three months. For those students who are planning on finishing high school in three years they must have a plan whether or not they plan on still getting into a college. If some of those students still plan on going to college then they should be aware that some colleges may expect four years of high school. Also colleges may look on your school record and just see the type of person you were and may not accept you. All this coming to a close that not all colleges will be acceptable of you only having to do three years of high school. For those who dont plan on going to college, they have to have a better plan for them to survive in the real life. Some students just dont take the school serious but only if they knew that, thats the key for them to open to get to their future. If I were agree with school districts allowing students to finish school a year early, Id think about the positive side it has. I believe that some students may actually do it because they love school that much that theyd want to get a head start with their career. Thats good Im not saying its bad, its just something I wouldnt do. Students who are more than prepared should be the ones graduating early. Only students who have had perfect attendance and do their work and get good grades should only get that opportunity. In conclusion, school districts should not allow high school kids to graduate a year early. They have to earn it and demonstrate their hard work. Senior year is the last little push a high school student gets before starting a new chapter of their life. School may not be the best but it can sure give you the best career life.",8,8,7,8,10,8,2508,"conventions 8, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
99,881,0AFC8CE27321,"By the time students enter high school, I believe that they should have an idea of what type of career they would like to pursue after they graduate. For some students, committing to a specific career at young age sometimes is a good idea as long as you have a backup idea for a different career in case you decide that you do not want to pursue in that career anymore, thats why committing to a career at a young age is only sometimes a good idea because youll never come up with another career if you keep changing your mind. The courses that you study in high school should be thought about as well because maybe you need a specific degree from a course in order to pursue in that career. I believe that, if a student is going to commit to a career that they should be very passionate about this career, they should be at least a junior in high school so that theyve had time to get a feel of the other careers and decide which one they enjoy and suits them the best, and they should keep in mind the requirements that are needed, the benefits, and the types of jobs that it offers to them. Students who commit to a career at a young age are usually athletes, or they plan on working in their family business. Pursuing your career needs a lot of hard work in school especially in this generation because youre going to need to go to a good college so you need a good GPA because youre going to want to go to the college that has a good academic program for the career that you plan on pursuing. Therefore, you need to go to college, and work hard so you can get a good job because most jobs, dont hire anyone without a college degree. Finally, thats what I think about choosing the right career for yourself, and committing to a career at a young age. although some may still believe differently and disagree with my view on this issue.

100,882,E6338A929654,"Having self reliance is a important key to success in life because self reliance is making your own efforts and decisions. I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self. Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them. Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like. In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think. The persons are going to have the freedom to choose what they want to do with there life. ",9,8,8,8,7,7,3324,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
101,883,269101ABF266,"Do you think students taking an elective class is a good idea? Will I think its a great for kids to art as an elective class because some kids love to draw, others can learn how to draw and even use it in real life situation. So this are the reasons why I think taking art as an elective is a good idea. Some students will love taking art as an elective because they love to draw. Students will love taking art during school. For example, my friend never had time to work on her art projects after school; therefore, she had a talk with her counselor so she can get put in a art class. Once she got into the art class she had more time to work on her art projects in school. She was also doing something she good at while getting a grade for it. Students can learn how to draw if they had a art class. Some students want to learn how to draw, but never had a chance to. Therefore, if the school give students a art class they can really learn a lot. Art is not only about drawing; however, some students dont know that. One day, my mom took a art class because she want to learn how to draw. But the art class didnt just teacher her how to draw. She got to learn about the history of art wish is pretty amazing. Some people think taking art as an elective is not a good idea because students not going to need art once they are done with school. I disagree because some students might wan to be come a artist later on in life. I know a lot of artist who making a lot of money just by drawing. Students who might want to take art can be come famous one day. So taking art class as an elective is a great idea for students. These are the reason why I think students should have art as an elective class some students love to drawn, some students want to learn, others can even using in life. Art is a great thing so why not enjoy it. ",7,6,7,7,6,7,511,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
102,884,64AE19BBA321,"A problem is a chance for you to do your best. I agree with this statement because of many reasons, first reason why I agree is it never will solve the problem if you dont try to at least do it, second reason is that you feel more competitive to face the problem, the last reason is that your friends and family can help you a lot with the problem. If there is a problem going on with your life you should always try to solve that, and do your best to solve it. If you dont do anything about the problem it is going to effect your life even more. So you might as will do all you can to do something good that can solve the problem. For example someone comes and bullies you everyday, and if you dont do anything about that then its gonna get worse and worse everyday. When you see a problem getting in your way of accomplishing your goals, you should always stand up for your self and face the problem, and beat the problem so it can never bother you again. Their are many you have to face during your life for example, if there is a someone that always bothers you or bullies you, you should do something about it. If you had a problem face you there probably someone that helped you a little to solve it. Its always really important to tell a friend or a family whats going on in your life because it always makes you feel better. The reason why it makes you feel better is because when your saying all the problems to your family or friend they kinda have ideas how you can solve it. For example if a bully starts to beat you up then the only people that can help you is family and friends. A problem is a chance for you to do your best.

103,885,7A239E4D1966,"My thought on the prompt are that I think its better to be active. Being active or doing something all the time is good. You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise. I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. I cannot stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some peoples life activity plays a major role in there lifes. Like a personal trainer or a coach. Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If Iam inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. Thats why its better to be active. Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You cannot be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and donot intervene is better to stay idle.

104,886,442CFAE61CC3,"So we heard that our principal is going to let all the students to participate in one activity of their choice. But I have both reasons that might go alright or not. Lets just say if I agree or disagree with the principal decision and hopefully that our principal has a good feeling about this decision. Lets start with a positive reasons. First responsibility, if the students get a activity that takes a lot of serious responsibility like for example serve on the student council or working on the yearbook, activity like that those have real responsibility to take care of. Next is not knowing it was the students talent, all activity will fill up very quickly and if any teacher puts a student that is not their favorite class they will notice that their very talented on a activity that they didnt like. Last positive reason overwhelmed, the student will get overwhelmed and sometimes is alright but at the end they still love the class. Second, start with the negative reasons. It wont be their favorite if a student want to be a class so bad but then a teacher decides to put him/her to different class its likely that the student wont be liking the class not a bit. Overwhelming, its going to the same thing but the opposite its almost the same topic as the last reason of not liking the class and overwhelmed is the part cause of not liking the class which lead to our third last negative reason, dropping out its most likely that they gonna drop out the class it will get so stress and overwhelmed that the student decides to quit and that lead to have a no responsiblilty in life. So I do agree with principal student or people need to have responsibility in life and without it theres going to be no job for that person who decided to drop of the activity they got asigned.

They will not get frustrated or bored on the day of school and they will get off of stress for all of the day they will have s time just for do what they like to do .They will forget all of they work that have to be done because with other classes have homework, class work and the students will be feeling tired. And may be they will not want to come the school anymore. Secondly students will be doing something that they enjoy because they will be happy to do something that entertained their minds and maybe they will be creative with a lot of things they will want to do in the class. It could be exited for them to have a class that they would like to have. Is good for their brains because the brain is going to work with more interested for be doing something that get all of their attention and they will be relaxing because they dont have to worry if they dont know how to do something because they like it and it will be that more easy to make.

Well in my opinion people should make there own decisions because they can decide how they want things and what makes them happy in there own way even though some would argue that, people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because some times they know whats best for us and our own health. Yes, sometimes when you seek for guidance they help you out a lot and lead you to the right path. They also, help you find whats happy but its not like if your doing it because you want your just doing it to better yourself and your not doing what you want your doing what your told.

110,892,A5567EF4C8EA,"I believe that students should not have to commit to a career at a young age because they will not take the career serious they will take it as a joke. In addition they are young they do not know what is to have such a big responsibility. Students that are just to enter high school do not really know how hard they are going to have to work to be good in the career they would have selected. First students do not really know what they have a passion for, they should not have to commit to a career they do not know if they are going to like after awhile in the career. Students should be able to really think about what they like and what interest them about a career before having just get in to it. A career is something you have to think before you get in to an specific career because later on you might want to change the career your in right now. At a young age kids do not really have a clue on what they really like or have an interest career wise. Kids that are young do not really think in careers they mostly think on being with there friends and going out to have fun. Also students should not have to be forced to be in a career they do not like thats why they should have time to think on what they like and what they do not like. Next students are still young to know what career to get in to they should be forced to figure it out so quickly they should get more time to really think on it. In most situations kids change there minds and decide that the career they got in to does not favor them and they want to change the career. We do not really know what we really like until like the end of the year of high school I believe because at that time we are more matured. A career is something to take serious because in the future that would be where you will be working and if you do not like that will not be a pleasant job to work at. You be able to like the career you chose because if not you will not enjoy being in the career. Should enjoy the career you pick because it gives you passion and strength to keep getting up from bed and get ready to go to school to study that career. Finally some students at a young age that are just about to enter high school do not pay enough attention to school or the career they are studying. In high school a lot of kids change and not for good they make bad decision and totally forget why they go to school for. They go to school to create a future for themselves to be able to have a better life not all kids think like that until something wrong happens. If they do not pay attention or take it serious they will not succeed in the career as well in life because they will not be able to get a good job. Some students in high school do not really think about it, but the reason why they go to school to better there lives in the future. If we did not have schools that give you the opportunity to study a career I wonder where would we be would we have good jobs that pays good enough money. In conclusion, I do not think is a good Idea for students should commit to a career in at a young age. Kids that are still young do not really think about careers or what they can do with the career they study. It is a case of kids that take things seriously not all kids take everything serious and talking about school and careers that is a problem. That means that they do not want a better life or to better themselves they do not want the help. ",8,6,7,7,6,6,2220,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

These activities are enjoyable because people like to be active and when their active they play sports they go outside to play sports.

The people at the community pool can teach others how to swim but its gonna cost some money but its worth it. I say this is enjoyable because people like to have fun in the pool especially if its during the summer . People can swim and play volleyball or play catch while in the pool to have fun.

I have two examples, my family want me to be another person that my self, and the second example is if you want to be yourself in this world you will never find a job; You have to be another person the they want you to be. I start with my family; How i said my family they dont like when you try to be yourself, they want you to be what they said, like jobs for your future they want me to be something the I dont want to be like: Soldier, Fireman, Lawyer, and president; I want to be someone else the they dont like to much, they dont like when I think in my self just what they want, they think if you are someone else you will have a big accomplishment. In the case of jobs if you try to be yourself, and not what the company want you will never find a job; The happen to me alot of times when I try to apply to a job, they want you to be another person with different expression like: happy, active, team work, and accurate; If you are opposite of the expression you will never find a job with the expression the you have, so you have to be like the company want you to be and they would give you the job, then you will have a big accomplishment from the company because you are someone else. Thats why Im agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people dont like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I dont think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who dont belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",5,6,5,4,5,6,3609,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

While others think that character is form by influences beyond control. I agree that as individuals our character is influenced beyond our control because of , internet influence, fit in society , and by actions. One reason why character is influence beyond control is because people get influenced by internet platforms. Internet platforms in influence in many ways some could be good , while other not quit so. Character is influence by social medias posts , YouTube videos and variables of things. These kind of things interfere with a person characteristic people might want to follow and do what they see on internet. a person might not even be awarded that they are being influence by internet. second claim why a persons character is influence beyond control is because they get influence by society. People might feel that to fin in society they have to have the same characteristics and act the same as others to be accepted and tolerated by society. People who is pressure by others would act and do things that they know are no specifically good. For example you are a very respectful and kind person but they you turn into a not so kind person their has to be something making you changed the way you are and that could be other people , changing your character. Lastly peoples characteristics are influence beyond control because of the actions they take in life. Peoples actions influenced the way they are and act. By taking good actions your character will be defined in a positive and understandable way. good actions will be the key into having authentic and unique character. In conclusion there are many factors that influence that a persons character. People some often get their way of acting and doing thinks from internet platforms which could be something bad its not take with careful. Today,s society can have a big impact in everyones lives, we are living in a time were people would do whatever takes to fit in and feel like think they are part of society, but sometimes being around people is not mentally healthy.

117,899,E545B850725F,"Although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if its a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and heres why. The students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how. Opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one. Other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work. The extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if its a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.

118,900,E0BDF62838F7,Hey have you been asked to teach a group of elementary students a lesson? well you have been chosen to teach a group of students a lesson and the lesson was multiplying and dividing because it will teach how add and subtract quickly. The 1st example is like going to a grocery store and dont know how much does 4 bags of chips cost for the party your going to well multiplying can help you figure out the cost. The 2nd example for dividing can help you figure out if you have a discount you can find the new cost and how much money you saved. Final reason is like multiplying and dividing fractions like 1/2 times 2/3 that would equal 2/6 and dividing that by 1/2 will equal 2/3 because if you add that is would be 3/5 and subtracting that by 1/3 would be 2/2 which is 1. So in conclusion multiplying and dividing can help you get answer more fast than adding and subtracting over and over.,6,6,5,5,6,6,3206,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

One way is helping each others when working in a group. when i work with my friends we help each other with things that might be hard for us to do. I sometimes dont know how to answer a question so i ask the people i am working with to help me with it. The people you work with might not know something that i might know so thats a good thing when you work in groups. I like to help my friends or my group members with any thing because thats what group work is about. 2. When working in a group we communicate a lot and talk about everything we have to do. i like to talk when i work in a group it even helps me learn more things that i did not know about. Sometimes i dont know how to say something in English so i ask my partner to help me say it or pronounce it. When i dont know something its hard for me to talk about it or try to help when i dont understand what they are talking about. its good for me to work in group because it helps me learn more English. 3. working in groups helps you and your partners to do less work. When i work in a group we split the work fairly if someone does not like the part he/she have to do we will give them a different one. For me i like to do the most easy one but i do not get that all the time sometimes i have to do a hard part and sometimes i have to do a easy part. I do struggle with things sometimes because i do not speak good English but i ask my partners to help me with what ever i do not understand. 4. One way to get to know people better is working with them and talk to them. When i work with people it shows me who the person is and what they like to do. For me i like to know people better and make them comfortable around me even if they are shy. Some people dont like working in groups because they like to work by them self which is not a bad thing. Talking to people is one of my favorite things to do especially if i know the person more. 5. It would be great for me to work in a group because it benefits me with a lot of things in a lot of ways. one thing is to get help from others and help others. The second thing is communication when u talk to people it helps me learn new things and they might be learning new things too, and i do not do as much work as if i was working by myself. its really good for me to work in groups because of all these things.

120,902,03CB73341E0E,"Do you think its a good idea to have somone make your decisions for you all the time? There is somthing you should know about having a person make decisions for you, and making decisions for yourself. I think making your own decision is the best way to solve life important problems, and I will tell you why I think so. Making your own decisions is a sign of taking your life to the next level in many ways. Ways such as maturity, self confidence, determination, and intelligence. The reason why taking others advice all the time isnt good is because there is going to be a time where no one will be there for you when you make that life changing decision or in a situation where you have to make the decision right away. When you learn to follow your own instincts and learn to make your own decisions is the moment you can show others that you are a responsible for your actions, That you are a fully matured adult. At the end of the days its all about whats best for you and the people around, the people who depend on you. Having somone make your decisions for you is a sign that you are not ready for the real world. Like I said before, you will get to that specific point in your life when you are just going to have to make this important decision. Thats why its always important to learn to follow on what you think is right. Your dependents when you were a kid, always taught and told you what the best thing to do is. So when you get old enough to make decisions on your own, you know whats best for you. The times you should be taking advice from others is when youre a learning child. A child learning off examples from your parents or dependebles. The times when you should be making decisions for yourself is the times when you have learnt off these examples as a child from your dependents, now to grow up as an adult and do whats best for you. And the cycle continues. I think its more understandable when you put it that way. In conclusion, self decision making shows you are a responsible adult in many ways. And most importanly shows you are ready for obsticles that will come in your way in the real life. depending on others just shows you still need people to make these decisions for you even though there will certainly be a time when there will be no one but you. And this will really hurt you if you dont start to take responsibility for yourself and your dependents.

124,906,6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college. First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they dont have enough money, and parents cant support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students wont need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud. Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you wont have to worry about being alone. Lastly, Some students dont turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isnt only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you dont have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already. I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you arent mature enough, then you will struggle. In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldnt have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

125,907,10A367BB87EB,"Based on Emersons statement, I firmly agree that if you never try to do something beyond what you already know, you will never do something and know if you could have done it or of you were good at it. Based on my experience, for what Ive live and for what I know, I strongly believe and agree with this statement. My brother for example wanted to be an engineer, with hard work and effort he made it. In the other hand we have Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. For example, my brother wanted to be an engineer since he was little, at the time he reach High school, he was sure what career he wanted for his future. He started taking courses that would help him get credits for college and getting involve with sports that would help him get scholarships. Also, he took classes that would help him improve his skills and understanding of his future career. Now with hard work and effort, he graduated as an engineer from Generic_school and hes happily working with his dream job. This shows that with hard work you can accomplish any goal and letting yourself grow. Another example was Hitler, he went from being a simple art student to one of the most exponent dictators of Germany. At a young age Hitler had a dream, he wanted to study arts, he started working on it, but when he apply to college he wasnt accepted. That was the moment when Hitler decided to do something different, and experience something new that could change his life. With hard work and patience he did it. Even though he fail the first time, he didnt give up, therefore, he became a dictator. Some people say that you should do what life gives you at the moment because even if you work hard, sometimes you dont reach what you were hoping for and the work is not even worth it, however, you should always try to do something to grow because if you dont, thats when life gets too bored, you dont have to be in the same spot your entire life. You need to let yourself expand and fly to grow and experience something beyond what you already know, something that will make proud at the end of the day. In conclusion I agree with Emersons statement that if you never try yo do something beyond what you already know, you will never grow and never have experience something out of your comfort zone. Youll never know if what you could have done was worth your time, which is why you should always try to something beyond what you have already master and challenge yourself to do bigger things that you never knew you could.

This method effects millions of students around the globe when they get out of their education system, this is one of the reasons why a percentage of students struggle in their lifetime when they end their education. In addition, experts have discovered that when teenagers use cell phones in daily routines in a certain amount of time they might experience vision problems or they can also end up blind, this is all caused by the reflection of the light from their cell phones, this is why experts recommend schools to teach students with books and not to let them use technology because they might experience vision problems at least once in their life time. The cell phone use in classrooms for educational purpose can become an addiction or a distraction for students in school or in their life outside school , they can develope a routine when they wont be able to live without their cell phones and sometimes this cell phones addictions guide people to end up getting hit by cars or by getting involve into car crash accidents, because they were too distracted on their cell phones while driving or crossing the streets.

You are going to start thinking i cant do this because i have done it many times and i always fail on it or i cant do this because my friends and family members say i cant do it because when i do it i always comes up wrong. Failure consists in falling to do something,it consists in the inability to do something or perform To success you are always going to fail and fail and fail till you get it right. you are going to face many difficulties doing what you like or the choices that you make but in the end there is going to be a purpose for what you are doing. You are not going to success on something right away when you know is the first time you are doing it , you have to take steps by steps to do it. there are so many things that are going to be wrong, they are going to be times that you are going to fail on what you are doing. there are going to be times where people are going to try to put you down and tell you that you cant do it just because its your first time trying it and you fail it in your first time. And your enthusiasm is going to come down and down each day for everything that people tell you. but you have to always keep your enthusiasm up.

129,911,CA73BDEC2752,"I disagree with what John Lubbock saids ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I strongly disagree because we are influnced by the people we hang out with. Like for example in America we have diferent accents all around the map and thats because the people near us influnce one another. They influnce one another by sharing cultures and beliefs. For example in louisiana they have martigra but it did not originate in louisiana, in new york they have a lot of italian people, and we all enjoy eating ethic food such as chinese food, tacos, pupusas, italian food. All of those things influnced americans and their traditions and customs which impacts thier morals. As we all know everyone has morals but those morals are influnced by people, such as our friends, family, teachers and coworkers. Ones morals has a big role in character. I would even say its the biggest factor in what builds pur character. A persons moral is what tells them what is right and what is wrong, what they should do or what they should not do, wether to pick option A or option B. Morals are a part of someones character, its what builds thier charater. For example if someones morals arent made up and they do not know what is good and bad then thier character might need some work. I get where Mr. Lubbock gets the idea of ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" but I also think that social class has alot to do with your character. I think that the different social groups have a varaity of character building factors. I believe this because for example a person that only makes 20 grand a year has a lot more struggles than a person that makes 100 grand a year and those struggles impact ones character. In conclusion I disagree with John Lubbock because I believe morals, social class and people around us influnce our character. I believe all those factors play a major role on who we are because it is human nature to adapt to surroundings.

131,913,DB9BA6D8278F,"Is it expected for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, i say no to this because there are many students that still do not know what they want to do when they get older. For example there are students that are waiting to know forsure on what they want to do in life and it takes time to know what you want to do. Another example is there are many students that may not be able to afford college, if that is what they are planning and that is why it is hard because many students do not have enough for it, and that is why students take there time thinking what they want to do but can do so they can be successful in life. Another reason why students do not know what they want to do by the time they enter high school, some parents want there kid to do what they want when it should not be like that, that is also why students have hard time thinking on what to do in the future. Students should have to worry about there future so they end up being successful in life, and end up doing good in life and making your parents proud on doing thins that they couldnt have. It would help out students if he/she knew what they wanted to do in there life entering high school, so later on they dont have to worry much on what they want to do because they will already know. It gives them an advantage because they already know what they want to do and so theyre going to work for it, they can change there mind if they want later on if they would like. If you know what you want todo in life its a good thing because then you know how hard you are going to work for to get there and be successful in life. If you know what you want to do it will give you an advantage because you will be working hard to get there and achieve your goal, just be successful in life and if you dont know what to do just keep thinking about it until you know the career path yo want to choose to be successful in life.",6,6,6,6,6,7,3095,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
132,914,E8F6D6EA06F1,"Should you agree to letting the school board add one and a half hour to the school days. I disagree because it will make students less excited to come back to school the next day. Students already have the work they have to do after school, adding more time to the schools will give less time for what the students have to do once they get home. Students have the work in school that they get normally, but once the school board adds more time, the students will have the stress that they dont need. The time that the school board adds will impact the students time, stress, and family management. Students will come to school with less happiness. Once the student gets to the school, they will have to do the same work with more time that they could have used to do their daily needs. Students need the time with their love ones so that they could get work off of their minds. Students will have to come back to school with one and a half less time to regain their thoughts and sleep for the next day. Giving more time to schools will effect students daily plans. When the student goes home its for their time to get the work form the school done and to enjoy the time with their family. Adding more time will effect the family time together, in replace that they will have to work on the time they wanted to talk with their family. Students will argue to the school that it is unfair that they have to have more time in school, then they will be mad that they have to take one and a half hour away from the time they get out of school. Adding more time to the school will put more stress on the students. Students already have work on their mind when they are in school, adding more time will just add more work that leads to stress. Once the student has stress they have to find a way to get it out but, they have to to work in the school and get work to do at home gives the student no time to get it out. The stress that the student has can build up to make it turn to anger and frustration, the they can use it in means that they will regret in t he future. Adding one and a half hour can put students in a tight spot. Students will be upset to come to school, given what they have heard. Students have to budget their time after school. Work can give students stress that they dont need to have. Having more time in school can lead to problems that the students dont want and need.

Although some might agruenming that graduate in three is bad ideas actually graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own. First reason is graduate three is good idea because be more mature for real world. Many people today they does know how real world work. for example, many teenage does not know how real world work; teen drink and drive involve themselves in accident they hurt themselves and other people without think about their action because their parent bail them out of problem so they dont care if hurt some one are not. All they know some has take care them. This shows that if teenage graduate three year they will be more mature for real world and they learning their lesson what to do and not what to do. Another example, is parent take teenage their full reasonable like pay for car insurance if brake the law parents stand for them say my child is innocent because parents defends for them if do some wrong convinces themselves they do right thing so be to late for them they think that way real world world work they woundt able to learned from their mistake. This show that teenage graduate three year help them to know their surrounding know full action they take full responsible own act. Second reason is good ideas teenage graduate because it full rsponable of their own they will pay house rent and bills, light bill for example, my mom pay for phone bill so real they care where money come all know is pay for bill. this shows teen will be more rsponable if pay the own bill be care bill not to go up. Another example I use to much light and water so when water and light bill come will go up ; my mom is only one that has pay bill. this shows that if teenage doesnt how much they use water and light bill because their take care of those things for them. Other some side might argument that graduate in three is bad ideas because you miss out life you dont know to have fun you will be stress out you know what make you happy. other example is on enjoy the moment you have as teenage. At the end graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own you will know what life lay out you out their.

134,916,9664D9C4C5F9,"NO MORE LIMITTING! Some people believe that students should be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. But should students be forcibly required to take a music,a drama, or an art class? Students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives. Dont limit theyre choice If school start to limiting classes and require to take certain classes, this is truly ineffective for everyone. All students have rights to pick what theyre interested in, and what they need. For example, If theyre applying colleges and they need some specific classes and credits ,they might want to take what theyre needed other than art and music class because its simply waste of time. Its unpopular, unnecessary, and unprofitable for some students. Not every students are artistic person and want to take a music or art class. Maybe art or music is not theyre area ,according to newspaper ""CNN"" s participation experiment graph, it compared to people who are interested and those who are not, and graph showed people who are not interested seems to loosing theyre focus and even irritating them. Its waste of time if theyre not into it, they will eventually end up loosing interest. There is no point of waste our precious time by doing things that we are not into it, obviously its always privilege to take academic classes in school ,but its not always the case. we rather do something else that are more fun and more productive for us. It is mortal for some students especially seniors. If school is limiting and make require to take academic classes it is mortal for some students especially seniors, those who failed one or two classes and need to make up. But because of school is limiting and make require to take academic class they couldnt graduate on time. I strongly believe that students should not be require to take a music or art classes, and make these classes as a electives. If school make art and music and other academic classes as a elective, it will be more effective for everyone, because every students will have choice to pick what they really want or need.

136,918,C70AEFA3CD16,"I am agree with the Emersons statement, be yourself in a place where everyone else want you to be something else is a greatest accomplishment, because be who you are is really hard, more when people is trying to make you do things that you do not like or want, and ignore that kind of persons is a hard achievement. The differences in the people is what make us specials, because every vary has their own thing that they are good a it and they like to do it. And be in a place where is hard to be yourself is not easily to support it, and it is complicate it. Be who you are in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Because stay in a place where no one let you be yourself is really difficult, desperate, and sadly. Is difficult be yourself in a place where no body accept you by how you are, the immigrant know how that feels, because they came from a different country where they have different culture and believes. Mexicans immigrant is hard to be their self in USA, because the culture and language is different than the Mexican people specially the language, learn a new languages is hard and when Mexicans do not learn the language yet they feel like they are not accepted, because no one can understand them. The difficulty of be in an immigrant is that you have to learn the culture, and language of the country but you do not have to stop being yourself. Because I know that be in a different country is hard to be yourself. it is desperate when people try to make you something else, most of teen anger got desperate when their parent try to make them something that they dont like. Teen angers just want to be their self and do things that they like. Because when parents, family or other people try to make you something different of what you were thinking is really stressful. Sometimes people try to make you something else, because they think that is going to be good for you but they dont think if is going to like or if you are good at it they just want you to do what they think is better for you but parents forget your opinion. Is desperate too when you doing something different than others and they tell you that you are wrong. Being in a place where no body want you for being different of what they want is sadly, because people do not accept you for how or who you are, and persons that are different are mostly alone. A student that is immigrant could understand this because when a student that is immigrant go to a new school from other country have to learn a new language, and some other students that are from that country dont accept the immigrants just for be them self. And I think that is but people should accept other persons that are from other countries and let them be their self. In that way people can learn many new think that can be interesting, and everyone is going to be happy, but when people do not accept other people and dont let them be is sad, cause they are alone. I am agree be yourself in world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the grates accomplishment, because being alone in a place where no one accept you for who you are is very difficult to live, is desperate hear things that you dont wanna do and people still try to tell you what to do to make you something else, and sadly when no one want you just for be different and you have to be alone. In conclusion be yourself and do not give up is the biggest achievement. Always is going to be hard to be who you are but never give up.

137,919,E11139259D4E,"Students have enough hours of school already! I strongly disagree about the school board adding more hours to school every day. Im not telling you this just because Im a student, Im telling you this because It doesnt just affect me, It affects other students in many ways too! This could bring students really bad behaviors, because they get tired of being in the same place for a long period of time. This could bring students grades down too, because students do not work the same when they are tired. If they added more hours to school, students wouldnt have time to do their homework or to study for quizzes and tests. This idea of adding hours to school does not just affect students, it brings problems to the teachers and the school. Teachers have families and some of them have children of their own, this wouldnt let teachers to go home and pass time with their family. Another problem I see in this Its that some students have appointments, Just like me ! Sometimes I have to go to my orthodontist, and my appointments are always in the morning, I have to go there every month. I always miss two or three classes, and when I get there I have A bunch of work that I missed! If they dint add those hours to school I could ask my orthodontist to do my appointments in the afternoon. Sometimes students get sick, and if they miss one day of school they would have to do more work than the usual. This affects the school in many ways too! The school would have to pay more, because they would have to give the students more food than the usual. They would have to waste more money in paper, bathroom supplies and they would have to give the student a new agenda with more bathroom passes in it. the school would have to manage more conflicts and fights between the students. If they added one and a half hours to school they would create more car crashes and accidents in the roads, because the students would get out of school at the same time that elementary school students do, and then there would be a lot of school buses. Students wake up pretty early, at least thats what I do. If the school added more hours they would get more than tired, the student wouldnt even learn the lessons or the teacher wouldnt even teach the lessons right. As you can see I listed many ways that adding hours to school affects students,teachers and the school. I think the school board should rethink this new idea they came up with. i think that they should hear other students points of view. I think Im not the only student that thinks that this is not a good idea because it affects everyone. And some other students think different from others. In conclusion I think that the school board shouldnt add more hours of school because of the different consequences it gives to the students, teachers and the school. And it not just gets the students tired but they wouldnt learn the subjects like they normally do in class. Teachers are affected by this decision too, because they get more tired and they get mad at students easier. This could create big conflicts between people in school and it could bring the school more problems than the usual, like more fights and they would have to give students more breaks. So please School board, rethink this idea you came up with and hear other peoples points of view!!!. ",8,7,7,8,8,7,3216,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I dont think it well be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day. Some student might have to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it well get dark and then they cant walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people. By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they dont want to and that will effect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that wont help them at all. If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end. Some teacher are going to have some thing to do and work at thing at there homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have think to do they will not be abole to do it and that will make them mad and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student.

143,925,D7B9BEAEE50E,"Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that its a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us. The first reason is because the parents of the students wont have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food. My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain wont function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day. My last reason, is that the student wont be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier. This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.

144,926,F11E6745A8DA,"I think this is benefiting being able to stay at home and do online classes sounds good. I agree because doing online class it goes on your own paste and you wont feel to rushed to finish, another good reason would be doing online is that you dont have to show up to school anymore so youll get to sleep in and wake up whenever. My final reason is if someone if decides to go to college theyll be ready because thats how college is online. Think about not being able to have time to finish your work and your teacher saying you only have 25mins or by the end of class everything needs to be finished? well that wont have to be the case anymore because doing online means youll be going at your paste and you wont have to rush to turn things in. For example, I take an online class, so for me I already know how it works and honestly I think its way easier because no teacher is yelling at me to hurry about or I dont have to turn in incomplete work. so I like doing the online class is also fun because I be at home while doing my work in my bed. Rough day at work, and you know you have school the next morning? Well no worries because you get to sleep in and do you school work from your bed. Thats right, dont have to wake up early and go to school. Just chill at home in your bed and do your work. Thats why i agree that we should have online classes because Ill enjoy my bed and do my work from home. finally, last but not least college. if you ever plan to go to college then best believe that college is online class and video conferencing. Nothing new go to the library and study from there who wouldnt like that.? In conclution online classses and video conferencing is the best way of learning. yes they benefit from learning and it helps them out.

145,927,71B72E8890F1,"Summer is a hot and nice season and most students need time to enjoy the break and here is why, so first off most students go on vacation out of state or country to visit family members and they stay longer than three to four weeks. When visitng family you need time to be with them and enjoy time with them, because you wont get to see them often when you leave. Even if the student stays for two weeks and the student returns they will not have enough time to do their summer assignments or to gather materials for school. One month is not enough time and not fair when us students go 10 months straight to school, two months and couple days is a good amount of time to relax. Also when it is summer there are plenty of activities to do like go to national parks, amusement parks, water parks, play outdoor sports, have gatherings with family members, and relax at home. I mention these type of activities because they are not available in other seasons like fall, winter, and spring. There should not be a week break in fall, because first there are no special holidays or reason why we should have week off, also if no school for a whole week and Columbus Day people will start to get the habit not to come to school. Although a longer break would be nice for the winter, all we need to have is two weeks for Christmas and New Years. We need to have more time to learn and be prepared for future exams, especially if some students do not have good grades and are falling behind on their work. Some may argue that two months and a couple days is too much, but parents would not like it if their child was starting to stay home and not go to school. We need to have all the time in the world to be educated and be caught up on all missing assignments. Finally it might seem that most students will forget information during the summer, it will not matter because the student will not be learning the same information as last year.",8,9,8,10,9,9,1470,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
146,928,07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?"" When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up. When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When Im sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher. When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones. When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school. Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

147,929,AA1ED5376761,"Success is said to be hard with a negative attitude, but why should attitude define the destiny of a person? Life is full of surprises but with a good attitude you can overcome just about anything. A great attitude isnt obtained by many but it certainly isnt hard to get. All success in life leads back great attitude and awesome mentality. The Key to success is to have a positive attitude and mind set because the person with a positive attitude will gain a healthier life style, a better career, and money. Positive attitude comes from a good mentality and when people have that they see life differently. People who have this characteristic usually dont stress as much because they change the negative to positive. They have patience and dont get irritated so easily or in other words they are unbothered by others. Giving up is never an option especially if it deals with something they love or a dream they have. Since they do not stress as much, dont let others get under their skin, and rarely give up they live healthier and happier. Careers are a perfect example of the power of good attitude; If a doctor goes into work saying ""Im not smart enough for this job."" Is it possible that his way of thinking limits the way he works? it may, because he will go on with his day giving 50 percent when he needs to give 100 percent. If he wouldve change the way he thought maybe to ""if i wasnt smart enough for this job i wouldnt have gone this far."" Now he would be giving 100 percent instead of 50 percent. Since he is giving 100 percent all the time it will make him stand out since he is not just another employee. Employers might just move him up to something more important or give him a raise. Money is something worked and sweated for, and for those who have to work ten times harder than others generally fix their mentality and attitude. If achieving a goal in life is so hard, then why did most High school drop outs become something great? Not all but the ones who did succeed in life they were determined and had a positive attitude about struggles they encountered. Money is all over the place it just takes the right mind set and attitude to get it. Although money doesnt give you eternal happiness a good attitude will. Attitude may not fix all of your problems but it sure does give your life a different route. Great minds all have something in common their mind set and attitude. Great attitude takes in life and makes them better. There are many keys in life there is one made for success and thats attitude. Three things that are there once you open the door is a better life style, better opportunities, and more money.

Having something small to eat like a chicken salad may help students from sleeping, being lazy to become more social, and having a healthier mindset. Students wouldnt have to worry much about getting sick or having some sort of stomach problem. Students should feel good about themselves having to eat healthy.

Although some students who have difficulty with specific subject homework would be great. There will be teacher and students around. Maybe its their same teacher who teaches the same class it will be great for students. Teachers will know the weakness of student of what they need help more with during class. This is why during school homework club would be great for teacher or students. Students who work after school could come to this club too they would be able to get their homework done and still be able to work at their job. Some homework club cost money which might be hard to pay for some families. If my school would have homework club it should be free. Not every family has 100 of dollars to pay every month for homework club. They also should have good educated teacher who knows everything about subject so they could help their students. If there are any bad educators who does not know anything about subject that would messed up the teacher and student both of their time.

151,933,DCDDFA12E124,"We humans arent really perfect, there hasnt been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didnt know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesnt want to fail this senior year. If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesnt sound right, does it? im from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours"". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didnt seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didnt mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didnt care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School. I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldnt happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didnt know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""Im sorry, I didnt know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""Its fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order. By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. Its not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager thats a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they dont affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane. Me failing makes me stronger, its like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it. If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, its impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like im doing homework, pretending like im listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didnt want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and im making sure that im happy, more than anyone else, Im not going to let any negativity impact my life. My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and dont let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing."" In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesnt affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes its a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you cant resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

152,934,FDFB04ED3388,"I agree with John Lubbock statement about ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" because in order for you to get to your career , you want to have very good character traits. For an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where youll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. You apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that theyll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits. Another reason , Your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. Your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. If your loyal to someone chances are theyll be loyal to you. For an example a Hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. Respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what theyll do if you disrespect them. You want to always respect someone. Your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and youll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. The world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. You choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. Your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. They shouldnt have to choose your attitude. Even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , I think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice. We control what goes through our head and what comes out of our mouths. The people around us should respect our character. We decided what we want to do for ourselves not others.

Schools should control students involvement in extracurricular activities, because sometimes students cant make their own decisions in the right way and that will makes them dont focus a lot on their studying and education. My first reason that the schools should control students involvement in extracurricular is the student can involve in a lot of activities after school or during the school time that can make him be late to do his homework and he will be tired to study; and that makes him have a bad grades and he wouldnt have a good future. Secondly, when the schools control the students involvement that make the student more successful in his classes and that give him the chance to finish all of his assignments on the time; also that makes him more understandable to what is happening in all of his classes. The third reason that the school should control the students involvement is the student will know how to spend his time in a right way and saving his time to the important things that would help him in his future, and makes him more responsible about his education and future. Lastly, if the schools control the students involvement in extracurricular activities, they would know how and when the student become involved and they would know if the students would have time to the activities or not. That was the reasons about how the schools should control the students involvement in activities and how it is good for the students education and future on the same time.

Students, teachers, and others employees have responsibilities in their houses and others places after school. Also, fathers can get a bad attitude about why theirs kids need to be ten hours at the school. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. First, some fathers believe that extending the school by two hours their kids will get more stressed. For example, extending the school by two hours students will need to do more homework, test, and projects. Students can feel like they can not do all of the work what the teacher give to them. A lot fathers doesnt have a good transportation for can pick up their kids at the school that late. Therefore, schools should not follow this model by extending the schools by two hours. Second, some students have responsibilities after school. For example, some of them have sports, drama classes, and jobs. Extending the school for two hours can cause that these students can lost their jobs or some hours, they can not go to drama classes, and can not go the their sports practices. For other way, students need to have some rest of all. Schools should not follow this model by extending the school two hours. For instant, extending schools for two hours and four-day school, students can have three days free. Students can have more free time, they can hangout more with their friends, and they can have more rest. Consequently, with four-day school and extending for two hours students can get more stress, and their grade can go down. Schools should not follow this model by extending school for two hours.

Well at a young age you might have a fantacy and a very huge immagination well at least i did, as a kid this could help because if you commit to a career at young age. When youre older youll be an expert and know the job by memory. Having to commit to a career at a young age can save you time in the future, when you have graduated you would automatically have a option and know what job you are going to do. This can also be a terrible idea because at that a young age you dont really know what you want as a career, you just go with what ever your parents or the person you look up to does and as you get older you relize you were not really into that career. Your brain also isnt fully developed until youre older it is a proven fact. Having a fantacy and a very great immagination is good because it can motivate you to choose a good carreer which you would obviosly enjoy in the future. May aslo be a bad idea because when you get older you learn to hate things you enjoyed as a kid and it would just leave you with a career you cant enjoy as much as you use too. For example when i was a kid i enjoyed to play Football i always thought i would do it until i died. As i got older i began to hate it, because it wasnt really what i wanted to do it was what my dad wanted me to do which i enjoyed because it made him happy. Now i know i want to travel the world and be a Photographer and learned to speak up for myself and it helped me to communicate with my dad and be straight forward with him there for kids are confused at a young age. Reasons why commiting to a career at a young age is a good idea. The more you get older the more you know about the job so youll be a wealthy man getting paid good by the time you are twenty five. There for you wouldnt be worried and freaking out about what career you are going to do after school you would already be prepared mentally and physically. As a kid you enjoy whatever your parents are doing, so you would obviously choose a career to be with your parents and thats a good thing as a kid. Itll make the job easier, funnier and more comftorable. ""In some societies, students are expectected to identify a career by the time they enter high school."" Personally i think Choosing a career at a young age is a bad idea, because like i said it is a proven fact that your brain isnt fully developed at a young age. That can be a bad idea to choose a career at a young age because you can choose a career you know nothing about, which means once you learn the job you might not even like it as much as when you first chose it. For example lets say Your father could be working as a construction worker and because he does it you might chose your career to be a construction worker. When kids are young they like what others like its just how society makes you think, as you get older you become wiser and realize thats not what you actually want to do. There for you should not choose a career when you are in high school and just enjoy your school years once you graduate youll regret it and wish you had just relaxed but that does not mean you shouldnt plan for upcoming careers you should have more than one option, prepared for after you graduate.

156,938,E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you dont really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up. Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them. Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day. There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal. In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. It is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all its effort.",7,7,7,7,7,7,3340,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I do agree on what Ralph Waldo statement said,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasnt rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records. Each NBA superstars have different stories to tell on how they got there. Not only just NBA players work hard, other people around the world has stories to tell on how they never stopped working harder than before to grow. .These are the reasons and examples on why I do agree with Raplh Waldo statement.",5,6,6,6,6,6,2044,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Technology is hurtful for all the people. For reason person learn how to get dope for the technology. Examples they used the internet to know how to get the dope from, and dope is be come unfavorable for a person. Like the person come be so wired to anyone because he doesnt know what hes doing. He be come a incorrigible person with anyone try to stop him. The people dont have to go to another one house. They just use the phone to call them and ask if they dont good. Because of the technology we dont have to see each other. They think its enough to talk in the phone or call each other video call. Before the technology everyone used to go see their family at home. Also they can go to the store and buy everything they want. After the technology they order everything online. When you play a games you dont talk to the other person that play with you. I think technology let you be come a unfavorable person. Reason we use technology for anything. Example you dont have to go to the bank to pay your credit bill you can sit and home and do it. You dont have to hold you debit card with you guess why because you can open it on your phone. Technology makes everything silly. Also you can pay your house bill when you sit at home. Technology has a positive effects too. For reason I can call my friends in Generic_City with my phone. I dont have to write a litter for them and send it to Generic_City. If someone sick and you dont have time to go visit her just call her, and ask if shes feel better at that time. Technology also can help you to make a new friends for any country. Technology is positive because when I came to USA I didnt speak English at the time. So when I went to school it was so hard for me to understand what are the people talking about. One teacher used Google translate to try to speak to me. That was nice of her shes tried to help me to understand whats going on in the class. She told to me to watch TV in English to try to learn how to speak, But to was hard for me because when I came to USA I was to old; and I was already speak one laughed.

My brother would always try and teach me, Everytime I hear the guitar, it makes me feel calmed. Also when I was in Elementary School, I used to live in Generic_City, VA. The school I used to go to was named Generic_School. In Generic_School I used to be in band, so I would play the flute. I always tried to play the flute. I would never give up in something that I like or something the was my passion. Though, later on in middle school, when I went to 6th grade, I got in chorus. Once I got in chorus I thought I would hate that class of chorus, but later on I noticed I cannot stop singing. I always like to sing along with music or people. I am glad that I got in chorus in 6th cause I found out myself what I like to do, and what I like to do is sing. Even though, what I still would like to do is learn how to play the guitar and the flute. Doubt I can learn, but I can always try to play hem or one of them. Another, thing I like to do is workout/exercise. Doing workout/exercise relaxes me a lot and makes me forget about a lot of family problems. I used to be in boot camp. I was in bootcamp when i was in 7th grade then I in 8th but I had to quit for a very obvious and hurtful reason. That reason is that my keee cap is out of place. I was suppost to get surgery, but my mom dosent have that type of money to pay the surgery. Now, all i do is take pills that my doctor is recommending me but i think they are making me worst but I take them cause I have too. Sometimes, they make my pain go away or they make my pain feel worst to the point where i fall in the floor. I dont really know what they are doing to me. Although I hope I get better by 9th grade cause I want to join the junior army that is at Generic_School. I always wished to a nurse or going to the army, thought sometimes I feel like if I go to the army I would get hurt real bad in there. Even if I worked as a nurse in a hospital, I dont think I would fit right in. I feel like i can disgusted easily but I still want to help people, but I doubt ll fit right in. I dont think ill have a great future. I can always try to get what i want all i gotta do is work hard, and ill be able to accomplish the future I want and ive been thinking of, i just gotta do the right thingand also at the right moment. Hopefully one day everything I want to accomplish now that I cant do i hope I accomplish it in the future and i hope it turns out good too. The wishes i have of playing the guitar,flute, my knee cap getting better, joining the junior army, get in the actual army or just being a nurse I hope I can do all those in the future. I want a great big beautiful and wonderful future. I want to make my family be proud of me for once in forever. When all those have I accomplish by the future im going to look at the ones who would bully me or say things about me and just say what happened to you? I know for a fact if to accomplish those goals in the future they will become true. Some day ill be looking down at people who put me down even when I in a good place. In the future i also want to play soccer or basketball in 6th and in 7th i sould love to play basketball. I woukld always go outside and go to a basketball court and takemy basket ball sometimes with some friends to play with or sometimes it used to be with my step dad. I have never tried playing soccer cause playing soccer looks hard to do but some say playing soccer isvery easy, thought it dosent look like it. I have played with my brother before but im always scared that my brother is going to kick the ball too hard and accidentaly hit me. Hoping this summer i go to the store andbuy meself a soccer ball and a basket ball for the summer to go out and play. Maybe with my brother to play soccer or even to play basketball but i doubt so i dont even know. Im not very good atr basket ball, but i sure can throw good in the hoops. Also always wanted to be a professional coach in basketball but for that I need a lot of practice and me trying hard but I also want to focus in school. Though what i really suck in school is Math, Civics and Science and I dont know how to get better in those three claases i try too but I always fail and always get and F or a D. I dont know really how to bring my grades up in those three classes. Yet i still look fordward a amazing future that i probably cannot have. Even thought what I said, I always got to try on something that i want or else i cannot get it. Thats why I always got to try on it. Hopefully bringing my grade up can help me on something cause i really need to bring up my grades ive been getting close too in other classes lately but in those three I cant. In the future I will just not now cause I cant jus try i cant say yes i can knowing i cannot at all. I wish i can ask for help but I am always scared to ask teachers in frony of everyone else so I leave teachers notes witch is ver y emberrassing but at least im trying to bring up my grade. Im just trying to make my family proud for once in a while. I will not only make them proud cause ill also make myself proud, and look up and thank god for helping and thank my dad that is in heaven that is right now watching me hopefully. I have so many wishes and dreams in the future that I am looking fordward too, but i dont even know if ill be abke to accomplish it and make it. All im looking fordward too is to accomplish everything and make people happy and proud of me and im trying to be proud of myself and feel like myself for once in a while. All i gotta say is that, no one should give up on their dreams or on what they want to do cause i know everyone can do it and they accomplish there dreams, you can always make everythinmg right you just need the riht moment and need for us to be strong and do it.

Cell phone can help people solving matters by talking on the phone and contact when some emergency happened. Cell phone can help people in many ways, as long as we have a limit on it. Cell phone is a device that has many functions. It can help people in many ways. When there is an emergency at school, the best device to use to communicate with your parent to tell them you are safe, or polices to report the incident is cell phone. Cell phone is not a direct contact, but it gives the least secure to a matter such as you are safe, some specific thing happening in school, and some decision that can be solve using cell phone instead of meeting face to face. Cell phone will be fine to use at school as long as students are using it for the correct matter and does not let the cell phone disrupt them during class. As time went by, more and more function appear on the cell phone can make our student and adults life easier. Some cell phone can even go to the internet! Some people can use cell phone as a material to find resource, study online, and read books online instead of carry those heavy books home. Cell phone is simplification for many thing you do, it can not absolutely replace books, but it makes easier for people to read and study.

162,944,DD474E5804C0,"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home? In this prompt I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time. Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that theyll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination. Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesnt like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well. In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Students would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job. Some people say that school is very important for students, that theyll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they wont drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month. All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that students can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.

You change the world, and you have to be sure what you want and what you do not want, you have to be yourself, you can be different, the different it is not bad, because sometimes ""Be like others is do not be no one"". For those reasons is why you have to be yourself, you have to follow your dreams and you have to fight for them, dont let the people throw you, and if you felt, you have to get up and keep fighting for your dreams. Remenber if you felt 99 times, you have to get up 100 times, and never let that people and the world convert you in something that you dont want it, in something that you dont love it, in something that you dont wish or something that you dont enjoy. Also in my life some people tried to change myself, but I always try the way to carry on and keep fighting for my drams, and one of my dreams was traveled to this country, and some people told me that I can not do it, even some people told me that I will die on the long way from El Salvador to United States.

On the other hand success does not consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Success is gain through those who choose to succeed and you do not need to fail in order to succeed. Working hard towards success without losing enthusiasm is important because you have to be patient and sometimes we can be inpatient so, we loss our enthusiasm we will loss interest and will no longer be motivated to succeed. Enthusiasm is strong warmth of feeling interest. Failing is alright because to succeed you are going to fail and you learn from your lesson, try again, and move on. On the contrary side success is obtained to those who seek it. Studies show that 78.2% of people dont succeed because they chose to be comfortable and not motivate themselves.

165,947,6805FE96E548,"Students having the option to have distance learning would only be great for students who are responsible and cable of keeping up with their assignments. Distance learning is beneficial to students because they wont have to worry about getting up early to go to school and also, dont have to worry about that amount of time they have in class to finish an assignment. Taking online classes gives the student more freedom to expand their thinking while having their own space at home. A way that distance learning benefits students is not having to wake up at 6 or 7 am in the morning to go to school. Some kids dont show their full attention in school because theyre not a morning person. Having to wake up in the morning and sit in a classroom for 2 hours is uncomfortable. For example, Im not the type of student that can sit in a classroom for 2 hours or more and listen to a teacher talk. I would, prefer to move around and also eat while im doing my work that makes me feel more focus. But, in high school your not allowed to randomly get up and walk around it would make the teacher feel unsafe or the students. Waking up at 9 to 10 is a good time to start your online classes because you had enough time to wake up shower , eat and that most important part is that you dont have worry about what clothes your going to wear to school. Another reason that distance learning is beneficial to students is because as high school students is not really easy to keep up with a teacher. when theyre teaching a lesson with 28 more students in the classroom that probably already understood the assignments. There are some teachers are just not the type to go back and repeat their self. For example, When a student miss class it feels like you missed a whole quarter. The teacher is not going to explain the whole lesson to 1 student she would simply say check online for the assignment. This is an example of why students would prefer to take online classes because theres no way a student can be absent. Student can walk around anywhere with their computer or phone and simply pull up the school work and start doing it on their free time. Some students would say its better to come to school, meet people and have the high school experiences. Although it sounds fun. Theres still students that would prefer being home and getting their work down at home then being in school dealing with drama or extra assignments. Theres students who would rather focus on online classes and finish them and also have a part time job on the side to help them pay for their colleges. In conclusion, distance learning is an advantage to students who are proactive and for students who learn better on their own. Having to do your school work online and especially at home makes it feel more comfortable. Its also helping students get ready for the real world when they have to take home assignments from work and make sure to stay focus.

First some students might want to boost there GPA so they have a better chance of getting into the college they want to go too. Also students might need to get the extra support they need to pass in their classes. The class work might be a little difficult for the student who might not understand what is going on in the class room, so they might need more support in class insted of taking arts classes. students need to improve on there grads or get extra help and should not take arts classes. Secondly Students have outside responsibility out of school like a job and sometimes when you have a job your boss might call you and say can you cover someones shift and your boss tells you to come in and you have to be there on time and the student has to leave early or not come to school at all, or a student has to pick there little borther or sister from school or daycare. Thirdly Some students are artistic and they want to be in arts classes like dram, art, music and enjoy doing art classes but all students are not artistic some students are shy or could get panic attacks they prefer to in a extra class or in study hall.

170,952,97167C9DC677,"Do people accomplish more if they are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose?. In activity does serve a purpose by showing maturity; however, people accomplish more if we are doing something. People accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Firstly,people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. In a everybody lives or in todays era, everyone wants to achieve greatness, but by achieving greatness people often or need to start from the bottom of their league or what I like to call ""THE CASTLE STANDARD"". In The Castle Standard each have their own class their, the bottom league is the beginner class, the middle is the amateur class, and the highest class is The Hall of Fame class AKA HOFC. Each person start from the bottom to get to the top, by starting from the bottom they can show higher authorities what they are capable off. For example, there was a movie called The Pursue of Happiness, the people in the movie was Will Smith and his son. The movie was about how a man, who worked at a business company as a mere employee, he and his son was kicked out of the apartment and they were homeless, they were trying to find a new home, so they started to live in a homeless shelter, but that didnt stop Will Smith from going to work. He went to work even though he was homeless. They authorities he worked with knew his situation, and they knew his dedication to his dedication to the company,so they decided to make him CEO of the company. In the end he got higher paid he was of the greatest CEO in the company and he was able to get a new house for him and his son. Furthermore people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence. Secondly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. People often shows determination, once they set their mind doing something they personally want to achieve or accomplish. In people mindset have something they want like, saving up money to buy an expensive item or staying on task to get a promotion at your work place. Determination is also one of the characteristics of positive attitude that leads people a success in life. There also shows determination when they are trying to reach their goals in what they want to become in their future. For example, the movie I used in the first paragraph The Pursue of Happiness. Will smith even though he had a situation which he was homeless, he had job at the company and he was in a huge situation with the company. The situation was they wanted to fire him to give him time to set his life or plan his life with his son, since he was homeless and they are living in the homeless shelter. He showed determination to the job and gave them a huge reason why the should keep him at the company. because he solved the companies huge problem which almost led the company to bankrupt, so the authorities decided to keep him in the company and give him promotion and a huge check to be able to sustain his daily life with his son. I believe that people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows determination. Lastly, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In everyone life has goal, there is no human being in this Earth who doesnt have a goal. The goal can start from High school or middle school or somewhere were people have been brought out by their culture. In every goal there is a purpose why that person is setting that goal, maybe it could be huge reason like impressing your family or following your idol and so on, but by setting your goals people often need to plan how they can achieve that goal. For example, in TC Williams High School my goal is to join the Airforce, but by doing that I needed to take specific subjects that can help me or give me the experience towards my goal. I had to take Aerospace, JROTC, physics, and this was kind of personal ,but I had to take PE/Fitness for a physic body structure, so that I wont be weak,fat or plumply when I join the Airforce. So I had to take step by step or take my time to accomplish my goal. Furthermore, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows progress towards their goals. In conclusion, people accomplish more if they are doing something because it shows they are striving for excellence, it shows determination, and it shows progress towards their goals. Also by stating you rmind on what you want to do people can make remarkable or impossible things that might shocked the world. I think the right thing to do is for people to accomplish more if they have set their mind on something extraordinary or even more enhance.

Student that attended a internship class may feel one hundred present confident to display what they have learn during their Internship class to the outside world. More Importantly this will help students to get started after graduation. Fundamentals skills are essential for any jobs or careers, so for any student that have the chance to learn some fundamentals skills of a particular job or a career would be a great head start for that student.

Some may say that people wont take things serious and just not even pay attention to it and see what the partnerships have too offer but, however it could help a lot of students who need too decide on what career they wanna do in life, so they wont be wasting time and money on a career that they dont even wanna pursue but, not also that people could get a head start on everyone who hasnt made up their minds. Also for an example a companies like Google could offer a internship for cyber security. And if they see that certain people are putting in work and are making a change in the work environment or even helping out a good amount in the work space. They will for sure end up giving you a job you like, but not only that many companies have really good benefits so thats always a great plus.

Homework club is a club where teachers help you with your homework or if you need help understanding a subject. Homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. Homework club is a big help for students. Theres so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early. At homework club you get so much help from the teachers. You can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. If a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. The best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. Its like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. Projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. If your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help. Another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. The teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. If you didnt know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. I can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. Many students cant really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they cant concentrate studying when they are alone. So if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. I recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. If you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz The last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and I guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. Math teachers, Science teachers, History teachers, and English teachers are going to teach students so much more. You can go to homework club and do your homework early so you dont have to worry about doing it at home. In homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more details. What I mean is that the teachers will teach you more about that subject. Homework club is one of the best club their is. It helps students learn more about the subject, it also makes them have more confidence, and it makes them be more active with your classmate at homework club. Homework club is a community full of amazing students and teachers. Theres so many things teachers at homework club help you with and that is Helping you get your projects done in time, helping you study for a test/quiz, and helping you finish your homework early. We can achieve this goal of establishing homework clubs in schools, but we need help from student to make this goal happen.

178,960,46EF1F716C52,"Did you know that some teachers/educators want year round of school. My decision for this topic would be, I want year round of school. I feel it would benefit students and teachers to actually focus and maintain on school work. Some students would disagree with this, but there are some supportive reasons why this would benefit the both. Reasoning number one, Most students take a 3 to 4 month summer break. If there was year round schools it would 3 to 4 week summer break, a longer winter break, and one week off for winter and fall time. This would benefit students to be able to retain lots of amounts of information. Also students would have an extra break for the one week off in the fall time. Reasoning number two, Students who take more than a 2 month break will most likely forget what they have been taught in school. That adds more work to teachers because they would have to re teach the information back to the students, and it would take longer for the students to remember the information. Students who would do year round of school would be able to remember the information that they were taught and it would be less work for teachers for them to re teach it. Last reasoning, After when students come back for a break most teachers have to re teach what they taught the students before break. Also normally when students come back from long breaks some teachers start giving tests or even quizzes. Most students dont study while they are on break, so they are likely not able to recieve a good grade on the test and quizzes. But with year round school the students would be able to obtain the information and less likely fto orgot what they have been taught before Summer, Spring or Winter break. Overall, It just seems students and teachers would benefit a lot more with school being year round. The teachers would have less to re teach and students can obtain more information. Also it would help studnets do better when it comes to taking to tests or quizzes. So it would be a win win for everybody.

In my opinion working with a group make things more easy and fun because students have the chance to exchange ideas and also learn more from each others it als help us to see things from different points of view. First, working with a group make things more easy for students because they will all work together in each part of the assignment, one student can do the research while the other one write the information the other student can be looking for graphs or other information that they might need, students also get to have fun by working with a group because they can talk to each others and also laugh from their mistakes . In addition, students have the opportunity to learn no just the topic of the assignment but also learn from each other, working with a group gives us the opportunity to exchange ideas and toughts it also help us to see the differfents points of view,by working with a group we also get help from each others because if one student does not know the answer to a questions the other students might have the right answer. Last, for some students working with a group makes them feel more comfortable because they can help each other and support the different positions and ideas, by working all together they will have better result and they will learn more by having discussions and sharings their different opinions. In conclusion working with a group have more benefits because the students learn more and have better results, they learn more from each other, they discuss the different points of view and they also learn to respect and listen to the different positions that they have.

182,964,FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work. First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision. Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students schools life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family. This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.

There are situations where a student should feel that his real hard work is considered good by praising his work. There are some students that feel that their work was good, because of their achievements. There are some types of students: Students that make themselves feel especial when their work is appreciated Students that feel that their work was hard by achievements Students that even if they do not try their best, want their work to be praised in order to learn Students the feel themselves in a position to learn when they do not give their best effort and it is praised There are many students that deserve their work to be praised to build self-esteem, because they have really tried their best in order to get their work done, but there are many students who do not deserve their work to be praised, especially if they have not tried their best on their work. Those students who try their best on their work, they deserve their work to be praised, so that they can notice that the real hard work that they have done is appreciated. It would make them keep their hard work. There are some people that truly believe that true self-esteem comes from achievements. It makes a lot of sense, because achievements come from real hard work. If any student achieved what they wanted, it meas that they had worked hard for it. If people want to build true self-esteem through achievements it is a great idea that they have that on mind, because it would make them feel especial if they achieve it through hard work. There are many circumstances where it depends on the type of people and situation where you want to build self-esteem. For instance, there are certain type of people that even if you praised their work will not keep it to build self-esteem. There are certain type of people that will. There are people that learn by achievements in order to build self-esteem. In conclusion I think that true self-esteem comes from both, achievements and praising.

First, you have to make respect your self, because if you dont do that change, people never is going to respect you and that is something you have to achieve. Second, making the best effort is very good in the today society probability not every one cares about how much you work some people just doesnt see that way. Third, another way that you can make your self respect is acting with a good behavior thats what people see on a person. To be self-confident. In order to learn students needs to put more attention in class and on what theyre doing. First, learning doesnt have anything to do with self-confident, because learn and self-confident are two different things. Second, if you trying to make your self respect you have to start respecting others first, and if you respect then they are going to respect you. Third, I believe that true self-esteem come from achievement, because you earned not is just there for you that is something you have to earn. In conclusion, self-esteem is not something easy to have you have to work harder to earned that privilege, I dont think schools have something to do with self-esteem or self-confident, but thats something you have to work to get it.

They all said golden and blue would be a good theme for her party. Generic_Name takes there ideas. Generic_Name is now having her party golden and blue! I also think people ask more than one other person because sometimes people dont have ideas of something they need help with. Some people need a better choice, so its better to ask other people then just think of your own ideas because hearing other peoples thoughts can make your ideas better. I think people should always give at least another persons thoughts on what they need help with. It is always best to get another persons idea.

187,969,D87F1B0CE93F,"Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" By saying this I believe he meant people should never be lazy but to always be working towards something. Not doing anything and waiting for something to happen is not realistic. Working hard to get something feels so much more cherish able. Being able to out figure a way to accomplish something can help benefit others. I believe we always accomplish more if we are always doing something whether it be small things or big things, we always have to keep moving forward. By moving forward we get to discover new things and see a change. Working towards a goal helps us to become more aware and understanding of the world around us. By always doing something we are always moving forward no matter what it is. Not doing anything is bad because you are just wasting your time and sometimes other peoples time too. An example of being active and it helping/benefiting someone is if a person gets good grades so they can get into a better collage. By working towards getting better grades the outcome is getting into a good collage. Working towards a goal is beneficial and an accomplishment. Inactivity doesnt serve a purpose at all but maybe in small aspects it does. It all depends on the type of situation. For example if someone is having a bad day you cant change their mood they have to do it themselves so in this situation you cant do much for them. By not being active accomplishments arent being met rather someone else doing it. Actively working and trying to accomplish something is most ideal. Never attempting to do something is bad. Always try your best even if you feel like you cant. Trying is always the best option because at least you attempted to do something. Things can get done if we are always doing.

(Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time. One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, lets say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects youre learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time. Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that lets say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and theres a few people in your group that arent contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone. My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best. In conclusion, I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington).

189,971,7F0703CF058E,"Many people success because of their behavior or attitude and how well they do in school or how great they are with other. But having a positive attitude is good because, If you are a positive person other people would like to be around you more, You will feel better and in a good mood most of the time, You could help others do well in work or even if they feel down or without motivation. It also helps in your daily day. A good attitude is great for everyone and it shows the real you. Having a positive attitude is good for you and others. Many people are depressed and being around someone with a positive attitude makes them feel better and more confident. An example of this is if your friend is going through a hard time and you help him or her or even talk to them positively about the issues they will feel better and even could possibly start getting a better attitude. Just because they getting the support or talk they need by a close friends with a good attitude. So people even feel so much better about them self whenever they talk to someone about their problems. And Having a good attitude is like having a good vibe and people love being around those type of people. You will feel better with yourself if you are in a good mood. Being positive helps with your mood and they way you see life. If your having a hard time at work or any other ativities such as school, sports or even at home.

A positive attitude helps a lot on your daily basic. Lets said you and you wife or husband argue. All you would need to do is think positive like about good memories or moments together. Im pretty sure if yall love each other the argument wont really affect anyone. Another example if you have a good attitude people at work would love working with you, People at school would love doing group work with you. No one likes to work with a negative person so why ruin the party when you can share positively to other. Many good things can come out of having a positive attitude. However, A lot of people would believe that not having a positive attitude is the key to success, They are wrong because a lot of things could happen when you are a negative person. Such as being depressed, losing motivation to do almost anything, making bad decisions, not like being with others, and not liking things you use to do. All this reason could be because of a bad attitude. But soever if you have a positive mood everything would feel so much better and you gonna have better days and other would respect you because of your attitude. In conclusion having a positive attitude is good for everyone and it makes people life better. Because of the good moods, helping others and yourself, having better days. And it just makes life so much better and easier. No one deserve to be negative or even mean to others. We all created equal and we all live in the same world.

First, if people in the world including you are the same, the world will get bored for example; when you working an a factory that do the same thing every day, after a long time working there,you are going to get bored. The better way to do is doing something diferent every day, same with people if you and the people stay the same nothing is going to distinguesh you, but since you born you came with your own thoughts and qualities,for those reasons you have try and work for yourself. Secondly, working by yourself and focus about you, and your own goals will help you to get your goals very quickly, because if you do the same thing that the people is doing, you will stay the same like them and lose interest about what are you doing and be an ordinary person.

Cant stay at tee ball , have to practice to get to actual baseball. Emerson is therefore correct in stating "" Unless you try to do something beyond what have already mastered , you will never grow"" because to grow one must break out of comfort zone and failure leads to success.

Opposition, mastering something is impossible scientific theories disproved got to school for 12 years, still have not learned everything therefore Emerson is wrong. Also, Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson states if people do not go beyond what they have already accomplished. They will never progress in life. Some peoples initial reaction would be "" I have not Masters anything, so I am unable to respond to this question."" There are a couple reasons why Emersons quote is correct. Growing requires breaking out of comfort zones and broadening horizon. If a person does not go beyond what they are capable of archiving they will not grow. Failure assists to growing and learning to lead to success. If people never expand their horizons, the they never experience new adventure life can offer. Without the thrill of a new experience, life would become aborning repetition of activities we have already mastered. Therefore, to break out of a comfort zone, people must go beyond what we have already mastered. One day at school, our band class attended a piano recital put on by Generic_School students. Even though, I was not part pf their piano class, I decided to perform unannounced. As I walked upon the stage, a my emotions flooded my body, such as nervous, anxious.

194,976,B459B5B87707,"Just listened that people started taking classes in summer for graduating in three years, Where are the breaks? Dont they need any break. Even machines dont work perfectly after being used continuously for a long time. Doesnt the same goes for humans? In fact, we need more break because we have a lot to do with friends and family. What is the purpose of going to three year graduation if you dont get time to spend with your closest ones? One year is not a long time if you are in a productive environment and surrounded by positive people then why to go for three year graduation in high school ? High school isnt just about graduating it is about making memories, spending time with friends and learning to socialize. High school is the time when everyone, even the most innocent start to get off their limits and it is when the fun begins. Everyone like to have fun, joke around with friends and skip the school for no reason. It may seen like a child play to most but those who miss this part, miss the most enjoyable days in their life. In the old days it is not money or success that makes you happy, it is memories from your past that bring a light, wrinkled smile on your face. Memories are memories you can let them die but what will you do of your interest, interest never leave. It will always hunt you in your dreams. If you are scared of failure and not fulfilling your wishes never leave the electives, which you obviously miss if you go for three year graduation. Electives are not needed for graduation but graduation only doesnt serve a purpose. If you cant have a class that you enjoy because of three year graduation then, interest and wishes are worth giving an extra year and you also get so much with it. Human beings dont need much to be happy even a small success or a short class that gives them pleasure can have their face bloomed for the whole day. More ever, high school teaches to take mature decision and have good manners. It is not that we get a extra decision making class or manner class in high school but being in high school itself teaches to take better decision. Being around with people teaches us to behave accordingly. Having many friends and busy time schedule teaches us to tell no sometimes. It is the place where most of the people struggle and get a better direction in their life. Everyone becomes a better person when they graduate from high school compared to what they were in their middle schools. Being a high school student it is not wrong to dream for one year faster graduation for the sake of one year job experience and one year salary. In my opinion, one year of job experience and salary is not even close to the memories you have with your friends and the happiness you fell when you come to school. In the nutshell, everyone of us know that college life is not so enjoyable and fun as school life. We hope to do so much but cant accomplish our wishes in the whole college year. One extra year of high school can do more than ten more years in life. Is a year too costly to spend for the life long experience and knowledge? Of course not. Some may think that three year high school saves a lot of time but trust me, it will be the thing that you will regret most in your old age. This four year of high school is the golden time for everyone as it gives the life long memories and a never ending satisfaction to each and every student who has attended high school.",5,7,7,6,6,6,2427,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 5"

And i think its a good idea for students to participate in a extracurricular activity because they can spend time with friends or you can join a club that can help you with your homework and if you want to play a sport,you can sigh up for a activity that doesnt need to tryout for that sport And if you want to get some college credits then you can sigh up for an activity that can help you get some college credit a good way to get some,there is multiple ways to get some college credits like a good one is learning a language that is a good way to some college credit. you have nothing to do after school you can join an activity that can keep you busy.

197,979,92F7DD653EFB,"Some people think that is more beneficial working alone that working in group. Which I disagree with for two reasons: People always need help and is more beneficial working in group. I feel that the benefits come from others. The first reason is that we as a human being, we need help. When we are working, we need help from others at work, during class at school, anywhere where we work. For example, at work when Im cooking I also need someone that can brings the ingredients. Some would argue that, working in group dont help you to learn, but we learn from others not from ourselves. As a result, we obtain help from others working as a group. Additionally, we obtain benefits working in groups. In addition, benefits to us are made it from others, benefits to others are made it from us. To illustrate, when Im sick, and I cant go to work I need someone to change his scheduled, and take my place, for that day, so he is going to need the same benefit from me to cover him one day he get be sick, or will have any emergency. Some may say that working in group is not beneficial, working in a group we acquired more benefits than working alone. As a result working in groups give us the chance to have more benefits. Its obvious that, working is groups is more beneficial this will allow us to get the help need it from others, and to have more benefits made it by others. We should always work in groups, helping each other as a human being.",8,6,7,4,6,6,1948,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

There are a lot of kids with disabilities who wants to go to school but they are afraid of being bullied by other students in school. There are some parents who are in college, and have many responsibilities and still needs education. There are some other kids that needs to go to school but cant get out of their houses because of their sickness or health conditions. The first reason why students would benefit from attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, is because of those kids with disabilities who wants to go to school ,but are afraid of being bullied because of their physical appearance. I remember when i was young , i used to get bullied in school because of my bow legs. Kids could laugh at me , and that used to hurt my feelings at the point of not willing to go to school. This same thing is still happening today to a lot of kids in different schools , that they dont want to go to school because of being bullied and judge for their physical appearance yet they cant do nothing about it . Thats why classes from home by way of online would be so important to kids who are going through this kind of situations. The second reason is because of the parents who are in college and have many responsibilities, as taking care of their families and work, but still needs education. Last year my sister had a baby, yet she was getting ready to graduate in college. She couldnt stop studying just because she got a baby. The online classes from home helped her a lot , because she was able to nurse her baby and take her classes at the same time. The third reason is because of those kids that needs to go to school, but cant even dare get out of their houses because of their sickness. I had a friend who had a very bad disease that couldt allow her go outside where there is sunlight because it could burn her skin. She wanted to go to school but she couldnt because of her health condition. The classes from home by way of online helped her finished her high school studies and graduated. Some people may disagree by saying that students wouldnt benefit from being able to attend classes from home by way of online, because they wont have fun, make friends and other things, however i believe that they would benefit because a lot of those students who take classes from home by the way of online, ends up finishing their studies, and their wouldnt be any difference from the one who made it in school. Having friends and fun is good but aint the priority , the priority is to get whats important and what will help in the future. Yes, students have a huge benefit ,from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing.

I would say why would students want another hour of school if they just want to go home and see their family. i would even say that i would not want another hour of school cause isnt seven hours of school enough already. I can understand if teachers want to see their students even more maybe but maybe they have to email their students parents before having to get the extra hour of school. What i would say is that all the students should vote online or in public to see if they all want to have a extra hour or half a hour still because it can`t be the parents only because it`s not fair for the adults to decide if they have to get another hour or two the students have to decide because they are the ones that are gonna have the extra hour. I understand that kids might want to do activities for their school or they can stay after school to do it like, assignments,homework,projects,PowerPoints,tests,and quizzes. I usually would`nt want to have another because it`s complicated sometimes doing stuff there and it is just to much for me to handle at one time mostly and i have to do a lot stuff at home also so i rather not have another hour of school cause it`s a lot.

If I have a choice to choose one of them i think i will choice to go to school to know more people. These are my three reasons on how students can do the online classes from their home. The first reason is why students want to do the online classes from their home, because maybe they dont like the people from outside probably they think that all people are bad, they are not nice, mean, in respectful. Probably their parents doesnt want because they scared of how people are going to treat them or they are going to give them a bad influence like going in the wrong life. Or they dont want because her son/daughter are bad having some medical problems they think that the people are going to laugh at them. The second reason is maybe other students dont like to a normal day of school they probably like to stay at home and taking the online classes from there, because they feel that people are not gonna like them or judging them sometime students dont want to go because maybe they have a medical problems because they feel embarresed or something bad happened when they were at school. Finally if I choose one of them like staying at home or going to school i will choice to go to school because I will love to help people to explain them that why is important to go to school and giving a advice to them that they dont need to be embarresed if they have problems they just need yo let it go some people dont think if he or she are hurting the person who is bullying them.

In my opinion the best activity to do when someone goes to a communtiy park is riding bikes. I think that when people ride bikes they can lose wieght, get in shape, and spend time with family and friends. To begin, when people ride bikes outside with friends or family. They have an epic time, when they ride bikes outside they can feel the sun on there back and the breeze going through their hair. Riding bikes in the summer time and under trees with a lot of shade is awsome. People enjoy riding bikes because, they spend time whith friends and family. That is why when someone goes outside to ride a bike they have an awsome time. Also, when riding bikes outside they can lose wieght and get in shape. When they go outside to ride a bike their legs make movement. And when they bend their stomachs to move their legs a little, their stomach also makes some movement. And all that body movement helps them get into shape, the best way to get in shape when they ride a bike is when its really hot outside. Their bodies start sweating, and that helps them lose wieght.

Some people think that setting yourself goals is something that cant help you in life and you have to follow what others do to be able to find success. They feel that people dont have enough potential to do things and by doing that they have to do what others do and not showing who they really are . I believe that choosing your own character is a way on finding who you really are because you can be able to show things that you never thought you were able of doing, you can set goals and try to put your best on accomplish them, and by setting your own character you can be able to help other people to follow the right path to success. My first reason why is good of showing your own character is that you can show things that you never thought you were able to do. you can be scared of certain things in life or wont be brave enough to try them but you have to be able to get out of your conference zone and try to step for yourself. this can help you in so many things later in life because you can create or be able to experience new things that can be come very interesting in your life. setting your own character can provide you on setting yourself goals too by believing in yourself and working hard everyday for what you want. it can help you in so many ways because you can see your own potential and see who you really. not being lazy it all and you would be able to have more energy in your system and try to work for something that can help you in the future and being proud of doing.

Although some say that arts class should not be required,actually it should because students can develop talents and also it can help students to lost some stress. In addition, students will find a fun way to be less stress. I am agree with the assertion that student should be required to take an arts class. Those who believe that arts class shouldnt be required they have their reasons. For example they believe that students may not like the class assigned and they also think that it can cause that a student may start cutting his classes. From my perspective I believe that arts class should be required to students because they can develop talents. I believe that because when I was in my country there was one private high school that was located at my city,in that high school all students were required to take an arts class and nevertheless some of them knew how to pain,act,and sing and they were so talented in any arts class that they were taking. Also in my country every year there is a competition that call the most talented students from the country, this competition only awards students that are very talented in arts class such as pain,act,and sing an the students that just to go to the high school that was in my city they frequently just to take first place in those competitions and thats why I believe that that arts class should be required for students it will help develop talents. From my point of view, I think that arts class should be required because it can help students to lose some stress. I believe it because like a student that I am every time when I get off from my Algebra 2 class I am always super stress,but after that class I have the art class. In that class I always lost all my stress when I start drawing things even though I do not how to draw but it help me a lot to keep my main clam. Also why I believe that arts class help students to be less stress is because the environment in the class is always nice,and the students are always focus in the things that they are doing without making to much noise and that is why I believe that arts class should be required to help them to dont be stress the all day in school .

210,992,B403A4E28BCE,"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters? Why cant we make our own decisions? Its because the adults knows whats best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know whats best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent. First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because its always a fight. Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go. Now she doesnt go to parties anymore. Then, we know whats best for us. If we know something were doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldnt make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place. Last, we dont listen our parents or any adults telling us whats right and whats wrong. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent. We know when they telling us that we shouldnt do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what were doing ( well at least some of us know). Sometime we dont tell our parents whats going on at school or on social media but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesnt go well. In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. When we get older and start to understand why we did all those crazy and nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing its not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing thats not how we would like to be treated), and smoking (knowing its bad for our lungs).

211,993,C655195F667C,"The best way of work. One question has been asked during a long time. Is it better to work alone or to work in a group? Most of the people and analysts have got the conclusion that working in groups could be more beneficial. A factor the support this idea it is because you get to have different thoughts, ideas and ways to see the life that can help you in bad situations. For example, if you are planning either something as big as a school event, or something as simple as a classroom presentation, there is occasions when you run out of ideas. You can count in the group. They are going to be there giving diverse solutions to the problem, otherwise, by yourself you could be struggling like if you are in road with no exit. Working in a group sometimes can make you relax, laugh and bring positivism, even in challenging moments or when you are facing stress. Every time you have to work in this way, you do not spend boring moments. There will be always something to talk about. You and your team would be saving memories that in a future would be a moment of laugh. Another fact about working in group is that you get to finish the work in a faster. More people working in the a series of things in a quickly way than just one, makes a big difference. It will give space to the creativity, where you can practice more, give details to the work or even do new creations. Because you are working in a team you do not focus only in ""I"" you open your mind and start thinking in ""we"". This is going to be useful in the future, when you go out to the real world. Working with other people, you have to deal with different personalities and thoughts. The team working abilities are going to be place in your mind. When as a team all your tasks are completed you will find a great euphoria in the results. It is going to make everyone proud of themselves and also it is going to be a method to keep pushing them up and never give up. Sometimes when you get to work in a group it might sound or seem a difficult task. But instead, you learned new experiences and new abilities. It become a helpful tool to develop character and to grow as a person. You have to learn how to speak with the people and how to tell your ideas in a clear manner. That is why many people agreed that working in teams brings more benefits than just working alone.",7,6,7,6,6,7,2687,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
212,994,E28221F47AE3,"Yesterday, I was talking with my parents and they tell me that I have to start thinking about what career I want after I graduate from high school. I start seeing what issues can cause and I think that it is bad idea to select what career I want at this age, because whats is going to happen if I dont like the career that I choose when I was younger or if that career is going to give me the money that Im looking for and what about if my parents are not in conditions to help me pay the career that I want, after think all this I meet with my parents again and I tell them the reasons that why I dont want to select my career at this time. The first reason that I think why is not a good idea to select my career at this age was, what is going to happen if I select one career but after four or five years later I like other career and I really want to be in the other that its totally different from the one that I select five years before, maybe they are going to get mad at me because they are going to say that am just wasting my time or something like that and I dont want that I want to be sure about the career that i get is going to really like me when I get older. The second reason was, who knows that is that career is going to help me in my economy because some career with the time they lose demand on the thing that they are doing and they give you fire or reduce your salary, but if I take my time to think and analyze all the careers that i like that can be better, because everyone wants a job that can provide a good salary and a good benefits and thats what I want, in that way everything is going to be more secure for me that nothing of that issues that I said before is going to happen and my economy stays in good conditions. And the third reason that I think was, what about if I select my career and my parents after the four years that we have to do in high school they dont have the opportunity to help me pay my career and I ready get very excited thats is going to get me very nervous because i didnt think about what other career I want to do. This is why I want more time to think about it and see if my parents can help me to pay the career that I choose, in this way me and my parents dont get frustrated, I for having multiple choices of what careers I like and my parents for paying something that they can afford with their money. In conclusion, I think that it is a really bad idea to let young kids decide what career they want because not all the time it is going to like the same career that we choose when we were younger or what about if after high school you decide to no continued in school because you have to work because your parents need help for paying some stuffs or because you want to buy your own things or just you dont like school anymore, so in my opinion I think its very important to have a lot of time for choose whatever you want to do after you graduate from high school.

They think village peoples learning everything . What they are need? I think""yes"" students would benefit from being able to atted classes from home. My first reason is some village have or had no one go to school. They just doing hard work. One day some peoples visit this village and they deside. They will be teach to them. Then, they are start the classes . Some people think its crazy. When everybody learning they know its good for everybody. They takeing online or video class for how they are makeing graden? how they are growing up? how they cant do hard work? First issue is how they thing about that? My second reason is I think the peoples they dont doing any study they will be face the any problems. This why they need to study. some people thing study is bad thing of life. How we solve this problem? The people teach to them many things for examples: 1. Girls under 18 they dont get the married. 2. how control the birth? 3. They are need a nice future. 4. Boys and Girls need the education. My third reason is I resoonse for the reasons because whole world peoples need the good educaton or genertion of future. Because who didnt get study they no how can talk to peoples. I agree for that because peoples need the educatoin. The village people now go to school and they send to child in school.

215,997,F4B3B2CAB030,"I belief in this issue about the students are responsible with their class is favorable for them, take a class at home . Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home. Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class. To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students cant go to the school for this big problem. Relating, this problem with school because the students health is so important. For example, the corona virus is so dangerous, students need a protection, because this illness inflict many death. Is so easy to get sick. For this reason, is important to students to get class from online or video conferencing, is better study at home and also a good place, is the best way for students not get sick from this dangerous disease. However, this disease not have medication, but students we cant to prevent get to sick also, studying at home. In summary, is important to caring students they are the future for the world. For this reason some school need to get dis option, learning from online or video conferencing. In another hand , i think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home, and other people belief, this not a good idea , students would benefits from being able to attend class from home for this issue, students not leaning in one video conference but, some students dont want to go to the school because they have more than 17 years old or they cant enter to school for their age. Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you cant not to enter at school and is a problem because you cant find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they cant because they cant enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they cant for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was cant enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home. The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they cant sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant. Some young girl want to finish her high school but she cant because her are pregnant. However, some school get a program studying online is to much better for this students are pregnant is more easy, to studying at home because she can eating when she hungry and carrying her health for her baby. The program studying online is important to exist help to many students with different problems situations or health problems. In summary learning as action for students who wants to study online or video conferencing. I think is a good program for many students who want to study. Clearly, everybody has the opportunity to study obviously the students who get study online has a responsible to attend every day their class and get their certification high school. In conclusion, class online or video conferencing have many option to study, just is question of time for the students , they need to organize time for study online and can graduate , this program no have many different then the school just, the student need to stay alone and the benefit of that is you can concentrate better alone by your self. Also is better studying at home for this many disease dangerous is more comfortable state at home. However students no need age for study, what they need is inspiration and intelligent for study not need age. In summary distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing.

For example if some students have to work , and because their works schedule take them a lot of time or they have to work at night, they do not feel like waking up earlier in the morning, sometimes they start to getting late to classes, missing classes or missing all days of school, but if the student try to taking classes online can be really helpful for them; since they can have their schedule at their convenient, the opportunity or the facility of making up their on schedule according to their others activities. Also when someone have to travel a lot for some reason, taking the classes online they do not have stay in the same place every time they are taking the classes, it dose not matter, they can take it anywhere they want, the only two things they need is a computer, and also to have internet connection, and thats it, they should be good with those two things or some people do not have that facility of moving of one place to other, they do not have the money to defray cost for the transportation, or is just to far away from their houses, so the classes online are a way to fix that problem. There is a large percentage that the students that are taking or took classes online are or were going great, their are doing a successful work, they are being tempting to show more attention to their classes, a lot people say that they feel the classes easier, and also that is easier to study, when the classes have videos they can put back the video over and over, when ever they want, how many times they want, where ever they want,if they want the teacher to do not talk fast or to do it they can regulate that also, they save a lot of money, because they do not have to spend a lot of money in materials, like for posters and things like that, they do not have to be with some people that distract them from the classes and is also faster to get the classes done. So how is showed the opportunity that some schools bring them is wonderful, it have a lot of benefits for us, like some students are more successful taking the classes online, so much students are interested in the classes online, feel like is better for them so that way they can be taking classes and doing other things, they just have learn how to manage their time; people that work can do their classes at morning and go work at night, they can have a flexible schedule.",8,5,8,6,7,7,277,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 5, cohesion 8"

Giving students praise always makes students feel good. Praising students who fail always has a different outcome the second time they do the task been giving. Giving the students praise always comes out to be better than what they were expecting;for example,a student who was doing bad before you praised them realized what the purpose of the work was and put all their effort into the work.

Which means if they feel very good and proud of the work thats been done the work that will be produce will be very creative and outstanding. Praising students who produce deficient work encourages them to produce better the next time work is been given to them.

219,1001,5D693DD9978D,"How will be high school different if you will graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years? Three years things happen very fast than four years. you cant learn a lot things that happen in high school in three year because you will follow different plan for to graduate early. It is not a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college because I have to force my work, I will be indecisive and I wont be able to take elective course. All this will be hared days for me to finish my high school in three years. Firstly, if I want to graduate in three years I have to force my work because I must have to take courses during the summers or in the evenings. And I do not wanna do that because normally my family every summer go to visit different country. Also I have to take course course during the evenings where I go to play soccer because I like to play. For example, if I want to graduate early I could not do this and I am to young to force my life, I have time to take this things slow because when I force my work I feel like my work will be wrong and I could not learn anything and that can not help me to go to the college. So three years is to short to learn everything that we have to learn in high school. It is not a good idea to force your work because like you did to learn things from the high school is how you will forget it. Also, finish your high school in three years do not let you to think about what you want to study for the college because your course will be to short and you wont to do a good decision. If you have a lot time you can think better and you can find a new goal. For example, when i was in eleven grade i did not what i want to study when i will go to the college. But now i am taking geometry and i like it. Now like to be architect because i found that math is one of my favorite class. If i just took three years of high school i did not what want to do for college. So three years is to short to take decision for go to the college, you can go but as a indecisive student. Finally, high school in three years will be boring for me without course elective because there two courses electives that i like. One of them is art and band those became me a good students, they change my life. For example, when i play the violin in my class with my classmate that moment, i forget everything that was wrong in my life. Another example is art where i can draw my happiness and i can remember that the life is not wrong. So i prefer to study four year and take my course elective than to study three years whiteout enjoy my high school with my course elective. it is a not a good idea to students to study three years of high school because they wont find the taste of high school. Some people think that work force, indecisive person and wont be able to take course elective is better because they want to graduate early. They do not care about their life, they just want to do this to do that and they do not learn anything. However, to go the college you need to be more prepare because college is different than high school. That is why must of the college is hard to enter because some educational programs offer that allow high school student to graduate in three years and then when they go to college they do not anything. Because in three years is not enough for a high school students.",6,5,6,5,5,6,1205,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
220,1002,61445D1ABF16,"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career. First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever Im taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because its really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling. Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. Its very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how its like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life. Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and Im mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and its a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since Ive drew so much in my life. I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life.

He talk with his teacher and explain his idea, the teacher agree with Generic_Names idea. The teacher gives a worksheet to the student that were in the class and the teacher said you may work on your own or in a group. The result was like Generic_Name thoughts were like, the students who work by them selves demonstrate good work, perfect scores and they did not took long time to finish the work and they were able to help others students. But the other group of students who choose work as group they show something different than the other students that work by them selves, they did not finish the work, others not even start the work between those groups was Generic_Name.

I prefer work by my self because I easily distract with my friends, or I start talking with them and I do not finish any of my work. Generic_Name said something especial to Generic_Name. Understand this Generic_Name, work by your self is not the bad you learn, you prepare more your self, more instead of coping someones work. Think abut when a test, quiz, or an Sol comes up.

I strongly disagree with this statement on the use of technology, because it limits the amount of outside interactions and technology can do everything for you. For example, now people mostly use text as a way to communicate with someone through social media. using only this form of communication can limit the use of verbal communication with a person. Resulting in negative relationships with a person causing misunderstandings and negative relationships. avioding verbal interactions is very bad for somone. Technology can also be damaging for the health. Technology be both physically and emotionally unhealthy. For Instance the use of so much technology can damage the eyes and can cause brain damage this can result to unhealthy problems in the future. On the other hand people think that by using there phones, tablets and computers. They do not have to be mobile and do a task by themselves with no technology. By sitting around and not getting up to go out and finish a task can lead to loss of energy and many other physical problems. The lack of day to day verbal communication can cause negative emotions. For instance not verbally talking to people can make someone feel lonely and unhappy. Using technology as a way to purchase things and avoiding to go to the stores can have some negative outcomes. For Example purchasing an electronic on a website and having it delivered it can result to being broken, missing pieces, and can be the wrong thing this can lead to loss of money and can lead to no possible refunds. people use this as way to shop for food, clothes, and books instead of being able to feel the object or know the quality of the item it self or asking an employee about the items pros and cons. In conclusion, Many people agree that technology allows them to complete many tasks without having to come in contact with others. as a result Technology has a negative impact on people limiting contact with person to person resulting to negative impacts on there day to day life, Although, technology is smart it is always best idea is to be able to do things more off technology and using more verbal communication with a people rather then a phone or computer using verbal communication is a best way to being positive out comes and being able to go to a store instead of relying on technology.

226,1008,9255DC307B75,"Have you ever been in school and your teacher tells you to come after school to get your work done? Well i think that having after school clubs is good because it can help us in school. It will help then get they work done faster, and also better for them to understand. Sometimes kids at home dont like to do they homework but if they do activities after school they would actually want to do the work so they can do the activitties. To begin with kids get bored of just sitting there doing homework but if their actually doing activitties they wouldnt be bored and actually work on they homework. If the kids are active and are having fun they would get things done faster and easier like say a student was gonna pay sports and you tell him he has to finish they homework in order to play if the kid loves the sport he would do it. nowadays kids like to do they work in activitties such as math games, card games, and many more. The teachers can explain the work better for them so they can understand and learn it better. To continue you must show them that the work is very important, and the kids would actualy take it seriously and they could actually improve there grade. Kids nowadays dont really be trying to take things serious so the adults got to push them and show them that there homework is important and has a big impact on your grade. Its better to have someone constantly on your back because it will help you in the future its always good to have people push you to succeed. A lot of kids give up in school and dont be wanting to do they homework thats why when soembody is doing activitties and learning they wouldnt give up on they selfs that easy on they selfs. the students also get bored of being in a quiet room just working on they work students like to be active not just sitting in one place bored. Last but not least you got to put effort in the work to be able to understand it and to get it done or if not you would be having a very rough time on your assighnment. But always remember never give up and keep pushing for your goal because not only in school will you be stressing. Lastly these are some of the reasons why I think it would be a good idea for our schools to have afterschool activities it will help a lot.

It wont affect my agenda because most of the time I am just staying home playing video games so I dont mind helping out,I will finally have something better to do.

230,1012,8CDBA4104C7E,"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age its a good idea. First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school. Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that theyre the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that its going to take them somwhere in life. While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college. However, waiting until college can be a little late because students arent going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career theyre going to study for. And if they dont, they could pick one that they arent really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future. To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. Its a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing.

231,1013,93C575DB7931,Would you rather ask one person or multiple for advice I think that if you talk to more than one person for advice it will hep you more .One time i saw this quot by Lebron James that said if you need advice always ask more than one because one person could be right and the other could be not be right so dont be scared to ask more than one person there is noting wrong about asking the person you look up to. it will most likely be better if you ask multiple people for good advice. If you are a person that does not like taking to other people you can just go to one person or you can try something different and ask someone else but if you just want to ask one person you have to go to someone you trust so they can give you some good feed back and good information. If i was to ask someone for advice i would go to a person that is very wise and makes smart choices so they can help me make a smart choice so i dont make the bad choices. If you need good advice make sure your going to the right person because you do not to be getting bad information if you have bad information you can make some bad choices. Getting advice from one person can also be good because what if your telling them personal thing they can keep it a secret but if you tell multiple people your personal information can get out there and can start getting bulled and you would not be able to trust anyone again so that is why sometimes you just have to tell one person if it is important information. And if you just dont trust anyone you can just go to your consular because your consular will never share your information with anyone and she will under stand you more because it could of happen to her as a child so one person can also be helpful. Dont forget asking for advice can always be useful if its one person or it multiple people it can still help you but if it is a person that does bad things and you ask him for advice he can tell you to do the things he does and you will turn out just like him so do not do to someone for advice if they dont make good choice. advice can change pepole live if it is good.,7,7,6,7,7,5,1958,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
232,1014,B84EF55EE7F0,"Although student-designed projects isnt a horrible idea, because students would pay attention more to the assignment since their putting effort of their own into it. But at the same time student-designed project can effect them learning more,because all the assignments will be the same. It could still be a big distraction for the students. The reason why i believe it can be bad for their learning enviorment. Since all the work will be the same the students can look things up online. Getting all the answers from the internet and being able to just cheat off friends. Students copying from friends causes students to learn less. Causes them not being envolved in the assignment. The students would be able to pick their own type of questions in the project. Those questions can be really easy for them and picj it for the less work. For example since the students will be not learning very much during the summer. They will not be ready for the beggining of the school year. Students will find the school work difficult for them since all they did during the summer was choose easy assignments for th project and cheat off of each other. Putting in type of effort to the student-designed project. Teacher-designed projects will be outstanding for the students. It would so get the students for envoled. The teacher can possibly let the students have partners and itll be more exciting for them. The teacher-designed project will have work thats equal to your grade. Not make it too easy but also not too hard. Each student or group would have different kind of project so students can have their own work. Yes student-designed projects would be cooler for the students to have their own project and not be assigned one. It can also help them learn more as much as not help them learn more because students who actually do their own work and choose good questions for the project can help them be successful. But there is just too many students who would cheat and not give effort to the project. In conclusion i think teacher-designed projects for the summer is far more successful for the students than letting them do their own designs, because of the lack of effort is going to be put in if they do student-designed project and the amount of similar project theyll be from cheating off of each other.

Why? the answer is simple just because you are positive doesnt mean that you will accomplish your goals, complete your high school with an advance diploma or even find a job after years in the university, studying a career that you hated but decided to study that because its was the one that it will give you a better future. Therefore, you have to work, study, and move outside of your zone of comfort for you to have a successful life. You will accomplish your goals with a hard working and diligent attitude. If you just have a positive attitude and maybe your goal is to have a car the coming year let me tell you, that you will not only need a positive attitude your will need a lot of requirements, like find find a car insurance whre you will have to pay monthly and also to the car company if you want a new car from there. After that you will have to work more an your payment will not be that same as before it will be less. Basically what I want to say is that just because you have a positive attitude it doesnt mean that you will have a car of the year, no its not like that, for you to accomplish your goals you will need a hard working attitude and actually achieve your goals. You are telling me that if you have a positive attitude you will graduate from high school with a advance diploma? No that is not possible, to graduate from high school is a work that you do for 12 years. And all those years your are telling me that you had a positive altitude? thats is not true, what happen to those days when you were sick in the school and you couldnt go to home because your house was alone and no one could pick you up from school, you thoughts were positive or they were just thoughts about how will you survive until the end of the school day?. Having a positive attitude is not the key for your success in school neither in your life everyone has moments when they want to give up on everything and live in a island were you will not have to support the society that this world has. After years of studying a career that you didnt like hoping that when you finish you will find a suitable job for you to be successful and help your family. Years of working in a part time, nights of no sleeping, hundreds of essays, homework in the midnight and group projects, sometimes not able to pay the next semester, and a lot more is what a university student has to go for them to have a successful life not a positive attitude. And after all that they have to find a job to start paying their debt with the bank. They have to prove in their interview that they are the best of all those people before and after them. In conclusion your successful life will come when you accomplish your goals, graduate from high school and university then find your suitable job. And not all the people can have a successful life because not everyone can go to high school neither university and those people live their life everyday hoping for a miracle to come to their life they will have to work everyday hoping that one day they will win the lottery and they will not have to work anymore.

Especially in a work place, if your boss sees you doing nothing while there being things to do, hes going to think your inactive. By showing everyone you always have something to do, your showing them that you are capable of doing anything. Theres no task to difficult or no job to big for you to complete because you are already used of always doing something in your everyday life and while being idle from the task isnt part of your expectation or motives. If you think of always being occupied and being successful it practically the same concept just because getting task done is like you doing anything you are asked to do and being successful is like achieving your goals. Secondly, Idle and inactivity serves a purpose when you are a 100 percent sure you can do anything when asked to. For example my dad once told me, why are you always playing video games and that why dont i go and play outside with my friends. What i told him was that i did not want to and he told me that my actions show a lot about who i am. After that he signed me up for a youth soccer team, that i played being a defender. Although i wasnt good, i started trying my best and being active with the team. Later that day my coach was talking to my dad and telling him how i was participating and doing everything he told me to do. What he also had suggested to my dad was if he can move me up to a left forward because of all the hard work and commitment i had done for the pass warm ups and practice games. Therefore, people that are always participating you will see improvement in grades, work ethic and body structure. People that always are doing something productive in there everyday life have good grades because they are used of finishing all their work, rather then the student that doesnt do anything and idled from the class. Humans that are always active rather than being idle and isolated have a better attitude and work experience. Going to the Gym doesnt only show that you have an excellent daily routine but you are person that has a goal to complete each and every day. Keeping your self occupied thew out any circumstance is a good skill and shows that you are not inactive and that nothing is excluding you from doing anything you have to do. In conclusion, do you think always having something to do all the time shows who you really are? Participating shows a lot about a person goals and achievements. Inactive people show their lack of interest and the type of attitude shown. While a person that is consistently doing things and keeping there self occupied and does not tend to complain about what they are ever asked to do. Always doing stuff will make you want to complete more each and every time.",8,8,8,7,6,6,1653,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
238,1020,71BA665B1B31,"I think that imagination is not more important then knowledge, so I disagree with this statement that Albert Einstein made. It know for a fact that I use knowledge more than imagination. Some reasons why i disagree are if you dont know anything you cant imagine anything. You might be asking your self why? But the simple answer is that if you dont know anything, you also wont know what to imagine. Without knowledge you cant imagine and create or do stuff. Next reason is that, I think knowledge counts as experience and experience could save you from getting hurt or killed. I know that if I got burned because I sipped from o mug full of hot coffee, I would not sip from it again until it cools down because I have experienced the burn. My last reason is that, sometimes when i use my imagination, I use it to create or do something and make it creative. But you cant make it creative if you dont know what creative you are looking for. One example is when i had to make my name out of macaroni and cheese. That was my reasons and what I think, what do you think?

239,1021,AAAAA48F6FEB,"Students should not be allowed to graduate high school a year early, as this will cause students to only have a lack of free time and enjoyment of being in high school. They will have to give up their summer vacations, and even their evening time because of the courses they have to take. The students will miss out on taking electives, as well as missing out on valuable high school experience by being forced to grow up a year early. With only doing three years in high school, it prevents teenagers from having free time. With the three years only, there is no free time for elective courses. All of the important classes have to fit in one tight schedule in order to maintain and pass all the requirements needed to graduate. I mean at least since you wont have electives you will have more time catching up on your mandatory classes. The lack of electives and and the three year plan, can cause stress and anxiety that prevents teenagers from achieving their full potential. Additionally, the students will lack the amount of volunteer hours and extracurriculars that other students will have through a regular graduation program. The lack of extra activities will prevent students from getting into good colleges, because they will be to focused on school to be able to do anything else. Doing a three year program means you have to give up summer vacations and evening plans. You will have to take classes over the summer and at night. As a result their will be no more ""summer"" for the students. Instead they are working throughout the year trying to get everything they need done first in order to graduate and receive their credits. In order to get classes during the night time, students would have to find a way of transportation. The county will be paying also more money for teachers. Driving to school would result in students spending money on the increasing price of gas. Spending money would also extend to paying teachers for their extra teaching hours. High school in the three year program would result in spending lots of excess money and increase complications in students lives. Many students wish to pursue a three year high school program allowing them to graduate early. They want to do that because, they have a specific reason. Some students have families that need their childrens ability to work, to help provide for the family. Therefore, a three year high school program appeals to the child so they may help support their family. Other families may need the childcare because they have younger siblings, and their parents work multiple jobs. However, a three year program leaves very little time to actually work during the program and can impact the overall success of the student. Many schools have work programs actually connected to the school, so that students can work while still maintaining their studies. However, a four year program is much better suited to the teenage mind, desires, and overall life. A three year graduation program prevents a teenager from being able to enjoy their high school experience. By graduating a year earlier, their childhood years are taken away as theyre thrown into adulthood earlier. Along with missing out on more childhood experience, they lose social aspects for their years. This includes friendships, being able to volunteering, as well as activities. The program can also take a toll on the student by piling on extra work as well as taking a toll on other people, such as teachers and parents. Overall you should always do your research before committing to the program in order to make sure it will be beneficial.

There is many activities to enjoy ,But i will give you a specific activity that people would enjoy spending time outdoors. Why someone might find that activity enjoyable?, i will explain and give specific details. As we all know that parks provide many activities for us. One enjoyable activity is playing soccer ,You dont need to have good skills to play soccer. Many teens play soccer or they are in a soccer team , because they enjoy it. I know there is a lot of enjoyable activities , but i chose soccer. I play soccer with my friends and family , we really find it enjoyable to go outdoors and have some fun together.

Your kids will enjoy playing soccer with their friends outdoors. Many parents dont let their kids go places with their friends , because they think something bad might happen to them. Meanwhile , many kids like to play other sports that are different than soccer , but they still enjoy it. Soccer is the same as many sports kids do at school or at parks. Teens spend their time at parks playing many sports during the summer time. My family go to parks to enjoy the water and play games that they never played before. If i enjoy playing soccer i think you will too , why not have some fun and probably hurt ,but hope that doesnt happen to anyone. You feel free when you play a sport you like to play or you might want to try a new sport. Always try something new because there isnt a lot of time to enjoy moments like that. Also,I think someone might find playing sports enjoyable , because its fun playing outdoors with your family or friends. We have two seasons that we can play outdoors and you will enjoy it. Also parents will enjoy spending time with their kids. Why not take time out your day so you can spend time with your kids more.

241,1023,408A7D3D2EEC,"Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view. Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Lets say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome. Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, thats because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life! Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Lets say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice. In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective. This affects you because its on you to ask for advice and make the right decision!",7,6,6,6,8,6,841,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
242,1024,4C3AFB55C4F7,"Imagine someone that you know, that is trying to show you what maturity looks like. And she set a example for you to see, by how she talk and how she treats her friends and family. You watch how the person act and talk. Later, you start to follow what that person does. This influenced you to also be respectful to the people around you. Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others because people follow what you do,know right from wrong, they are going to influence more other people. First reason, setting a good example to influence others is the best thing because people follow what you do. They look up to you as a role model for them. Whoever you hang around with, that is whoever going to influence you. For example, if someone is doing a act of kindness, then you are going to do the exact same thing, because it influenced you. Philosopher Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Overall, if one person set a good example in life, it influence the others also. Second reason, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because you know right from wrong. If no one set examples for others to see, then they would not know what to do when difficult situation arrives. Examples guide you to do what you know is right. People would not know how to act if theres no examples to be set. In summary, examples setting by other people help you make good decisions in life. Third reason, some people may believe that setting examples by someones behavior is not the best way to influence others. However, I believe that setting examples is the best way to influence others because its not just one person that they are influencing, but many more people. For example, if a girl help a elder lady that needed help with carrying groceries inside the house, then others will see that and learn to help people that are in need also. Because of that one influence, others will care for people that need help. If one person set a good example, then others will also set a good example for many more people. In conclusion, many people will be influenced because of that one example that people set. The best way to influence someone is through examples that are set by others, and how their behavior and attitudes are towards people. Setting examples is a good way to show people what you are trying to teach them and it gives them a idea of whats happening. Through all of these examples that people had set for you, they will influence you. When you do the example, because it influenced you, others will also catch that influence from you. So yes, setting examples is the only thing that will influence people and make a big impact in peoples lives.

When we have the option of working individually or in group, some people may choice i different choice of how they would like to work for different reasons, some people may like to work in groups because they feel that may have more possibilities of talking to their friends or someone that they like, or they may feel that they work may get complicated or may take longer and that they may need help to accomplish it,so they would like to work in group to get help and to finish the work faster. Some people that would like to work individually may chose that choice because maybe they like to be alone and work by themselves,or maybe because they feel that they okay and that they dont need the help from anyone else to finish or do the work. In some cause on school, teachers sometimes dont like or dont prefer students working in groups because they want to see if they know how to do the work and if they can actually do it by themselves, or sometimes they worry that one person wont do the work and just let the rest of the people in the group do the work,or just do wherever the other guys are doing, or copy work from them, is true that it could happen in some occasions, but is not always like that,and the reasons why it would be good to allow students to work in group would be that, if every student knows how to the work,then every student can participate doing a different activity on the group and cooperate with anyone, or if the student doesnt know how to do the work, then he\she can get help from his/her partners to explain the him/her how to do the work ,and them she/he can be able to do the work,and they all can be able to participate in the activities. Has a conclusion, it would be better do work in groups, because in that way it could be easier to get the work done, because you can get help from others in the work,and it would be more fun because you can work with your friends at the same time that they do the work, and it could also be another way of how to met people and make new friends when sometimes you have to work with people that you dont know, and for the people that like to work by themselves, maybe they should know all those benefits of working with people, but is they think that they have no problem working by themselves or that they can get the work done by themselves, then that should be okay to.",6,6,6,7,7,6,3517,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
244,1026,43B0E1211D58,"School is a very important part in a persons life, however it takes away most of students and teachers day. In a normal public middle school in Maryland, a student first class starts at 8:15 in the morning and the last class ends at 3:00 pm. Which means that a student spends 7 hours and 25 minutes in school, that is a long time for a person to be receiving information nonstop. The school board should not extend the school day, because that would take time away from activities that students need or will need in the future, such as: students would have less time to do homework or study, students would have less time to participate in after school activities like sports, and students wouldl have less time to volunteer in community events. Students would have less time to do homework or study. Students already spends more than seven hours at school and usually has 6-8 classes that last 45 minutes each from those 6-8 classes at least 3 would have assigned homework to the students which means that the students would need time to complete their homework with accuracy, if the school days werre extended students would have less time to complete their homework which means that their grade might go decrease for missing assignments. Students would have less time to participate in after school activities such as sports, or clubs. Every healthy person should exercise for at least 1 hour per day and at school not every student takes physical education (P.E.) as a course which leads to the thought that students might not me be getting the necessary amount of exercise per day, and even if a student did take P.E. a normal class lasts 45 minutes, which is not enough for a healthy person. If the school board were to add one and a half hours to the school day students would have less time to practice in an after school team. Clubs are just like sports are a very big thing in a school, clubs shows students opportunities they usually would not get in a school day. if the school board were to extend the school day students that are parts of clubs would probably get less time to spend time in those clubs. Students will have less time to volunteer in community events. Community service is usually a requirement in most curiculums, in past experiences I have had to have 75 hours of community service those hours were earned for volunteer work, like helping a teacher with younger students or helping a teacher organize her classroom before the school year, etc. . Those acts were usually done after school and usually took around 2 hours. If the school board were to extend the school day srudents would have less time to finish their community service and could eventually fail beacause of not enough volunteering hours. Overall it is just more convienient for the school board to not add anymore hours to the school day so students can have more time for their other activities like sports clubs and community service",7,6,8,8,8,7,881,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

If students dont attend their actual school there will be less problems. Some students are treated really bad in school , many are bullied , and also many like to be drama queens . However if students attend school at home it will benefit a child because they wont have to see other students and there will be less drama and more education.

251,1033,698A3F2B43B9,"Have you ever thought about staring your future career in a young age? Well, This question has been asked to a lot of people. Lots of people have responded to this question saying ""yes"" and ""no"". Everyone has their reason why they start in a young age and why they dont start in a young age. In my opinion young students should start to think about their future career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to be in their life and they will know what kind of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. Even though, some would argue that young students shouldnt start to think about their future career in a young age because they will spend less time with friends and family. My first example is, it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life in the future. For example, young age students can change their mind and might not want to choice that path no more. Also, If that happens, young students gets lots of time to think of another career path they want to take. For example, a kid is thinking about being a police but then later on he wants to be a doctor, that give the kid time to think about what he wants to be. Lastly, students get a head start of what their future career is going to be like. In addition, This head start gives them time to plan and organize everything they need. For example, kids have lots of things they want to be so they get a head start so they can get an idea of what career they choices to take. My last example is, They will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to to get to their goal. For example, students can choice the right classes that will help them achieve their goal. Also, they dont have to stress out about them taking the wrong classes. Like, If a kid wants to be a doctor when he grows up he will already choice the courses of being a doctor. Lastly, students knows what types of material they will need for the classes; to help them get prepare. In addition, This helps the students a lot because they will already have the mind set to think of what they will be needing in the future. Like, thats a good skill to have, knowing what you need in the future and not worry about it in the last minute. Some would argue that students shouldnt start to think about their career in a young age because they will spend less time with their friends and family. For example, kids are so full of energy and want to go out and have some fun all the time. Also, they want to make precious time and memories with their friends and family. Sure , its nice to go have some fun and get to enjoy life with the ones you care about more. However, you got to remember that you going to be the one responsible for your own future and if you put effort your going to have an amazing impact in the future with your career. In conclusion, students should start to think about their career in a young age because it will give them an idea of what they want to do in their life and they will know what kinds of courses or classes they will be taking to get to their goal. It will keep them focuse on their goals and will make a big impact in their lives since they already have everything planed out. In addition, this will prepare them for the real world.

252,1034,49F54A35F6F3,"Some people say that students are better off attending classes online, mostly because they can feel a sense of comfort and no worries of school tardiness. I say that its better to not attend distant classes and attend them from the school itself. Students are better off attending classes from the actual school because students tend to have more concentration while actually attending the class. When attending the class from home, students will be more concentrated on their home atmosphere, or what happens at home. Concentrating onto something usually comes from the atmosphere you are in. Attend your classes are better and more effective when the person is alerted or more attentive to their classes or courses. Moreover, students will develop social communication when interacting with other students. Social communication is important because not only will you get to know the other persons side of knowledge, but you can get experience from the other person that could benefit or impact your way of making desicions in your life. Students will be more of an introvert if attend classes from home or distant classes. In this way, students will definitely develop working skills when they start having a job as an older person. However, even if they wont be able to go through or worry about tardiness if taking distant classes, going to school knowing that there is tardiness, will prepare them for the future when running to work and making it on time. Making to school or work on time depends on how the individual is smart enough to manage their own time wisely. In conclusion, the more preferable method for students is coming to school or the class session wherever its taking place. In this way, students develop better communication, better concentration and develop time management. Students will become better individuals.

254,1036,65B1F548E8BE,"As teen mature, they make opinions about issues that can affect them. Some school offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think students should not be benefit to attent classes from home. Students would not be able to socialize with other students. For example, staying home every single day and not going out can lead you to depression. I personnel cant stay home all day and only focus on school. Also, teenagers need to interact with people more often and not be home all day. In conclusion, students need to get out of their home to clear their mind about all the work the school gives them. Students would not be responsible in the future. For example, when they grow up they will not have the knowledge and the resposability it take to get a job out side of home. Students would not know all the resposabilities it takes to wake up every single day in the morning to go to school and do all the work that is required to do to be able to graduate. In other word, it will affect them not knowing how hard its to work hard for something they never force them self to do. In conclusion, teenagers should get the experience and the hard work it take to be successful in life at a young age. While some people believe that students should not be benefit to attend classes from home, others argue that students should be benefit to attend classes from home because they can do their work on their own pace. Althought this might be valid,There is several ideas to considered such as, Students would not be able to experience of being part of a club or sport in school. For example, Schools have many activies that can be helpful for students futher in life. Students will not know how it feel to be part of a team or how to work as a team. Also, In the furure sometimes they will be required to work with a group of people but they will not be comfortable because they never had that experience. In conclusion, Students wouldnt be able to do any activies in school. Students shouldnt be allow to take classes at home while other students go to school. First, Students will be isolated in their home all the time. Secondly, They will not know the hard work they need to put in to achieve something. Finally, Students wouldnt be able to enjoy the life of a teenager.

255,1037,EC2758A5B74E,"Dear School board, Why does a students education matter? To me, it is extremely important because it can affect them for their entire life in positive or in negative ways. It could lead them to a job with a seven figure salary, or to work a part-time job at a fast food restaurant making minimum wage. Whats also important to me is the learning experience. I believe learning should be fun, interesting, and not stressful for students. Thats why I agree with the school boards plan to extend the school day by one and a half hours, because that way, students wouldnt feel rushed and would have more time to learn, teacher will have more time to teach and using new ways, and the school year would be a little shorter. To begin with, I agree with the school board to extend the school day because students wouldnt feel rushed and they would have more time to learn. Right now, each of our periods are only about 50 minutes, which I think really isnt a lot of time to learn once you start working. If one and a half hours is added to the current school day, we would have at least an hour for each class. This way, the students would have more time to complete projects, assignments, or just have more time to really understand the subject without feeling rushed. I know this because right now, I am working on a project in science class that we only have two class periods to finish, which totals for just about one and a half hours! I am not saying that a little push isnt necessary or beneficial, but the extra time would definitely boost the quality of the students work at our school without rushing them. Secondly, I think the school board should increase the school day by one and a half hours because that will let teachers have more time to teach, while using unique ways to do so. With the students having more time to learn, the teachers could potentially also have more time to actually create a better learning experience. Extending the day ensures that teachers would be able to thoroughly explain new concepts and materials, while also teaching using better or more effective methods that wouldnt have been possible because of the shortage of time. For instance, sometimes we have educational scavenger hunts, where the teacher lays the information throughout the campus and we would have to find them. The issue is, weve never been able to finish, not because it wasnt possible to, but because there simply wasnt enough time. Those kinds of educational activities are, in my opinion, very fun, but its also effective. So if we have more time, I am sure that some teachers would plan and teach more using different ways which are beneficial to both the student and the teacher. Lastly, the school boards plan to extend one and a half hours to the school day is something I strongly concur with because school will be out earlier in the summer. While I do enjoy school very much, I think summer break is something that everyone looks forward to. The days that are cut down because of the increased time allows students to attend more activities and spend more time together with their families. Even though the students arent at school, they could still be learning something new on their own. For example, they could be learning how to play an instrument, training for sports, or learning how to speak another language, which are all very helpful for them. Also, the teachers could be attending conferences which lets them collaborate with other teachers on creating newer and more efficient methods to teach, which will help everyone in the long run. In conclusion, the reasons why I agree with the school board to extend the hours are because students wouldnt feel rushed, teachers would have more time to teach in unique ways, and school will be out sooner in the summer. Although I think there are many more reasons why the school day should be longer, those are the main ones. There are just so many benefits that this extended time would create; possibly having an effect on the entire community. This is not an immense amount of change but it can be a big success, which is why I think you should really consider extending the school hours.

256,1038,D1A0AFC80A9A,"Ever since, we were kids we started choosing our own character traits. it can be good or bad based of the environment we live in, how we were raised, and personal experiences. But we can always change our character traits, its similar to an opinion on something or someone. We choose who influence us. we decide if we want to be happy or sad,making good and bad decisions all those are character traits that we choose with our minds. Lets say you are inspired by Kobe Bryant. You look up to him as an idol because, of what he accomplished in his lifetime. You either wanna be like Kobe or be better than him. That right there is a character trait, the ability to choose who influences us by what they have accomplished. Some people believe we cant choose our character traits because we did not decide nor choose the way we wanted to be born, we did not choose if we wanted to be tall, short, black, white etc.. But, they miss the fact that character trait is not about the things we cant change, its about the things we can change and decide for ourselves to become a better person or be like someone who influenced us. Choosing character traits is not an easy task for everyone. In fact, adults have a hard time choosing character traits. Unlike,most kids that dont care about the consequences nor judgments, kids usually choose careless traits but as they get older and become adults, they realized their mistakes and they choose traits with precautions. Mainly because adults have a lot of things to worry and take care of, their character traits can cost them to miss out on big opportunities like a job or a promotion. Something we all have in common is character traits, without it our lives would be meaningless we would not achieve nothing big or anything to be proud of.

257,1039,A2957D006D28,"It has been said that the first impression are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for at three seconds you think you know that individual already, Until you have a conversation with him/her for at least ten seconds your whole impression will change with a ""blink of a eye"". However, I disagree the first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, personality, and there way communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view of a individual. From your first impression when you look at them. However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Base on you information on someone arent ever really true. Meaning looks can be deceiving. Ex. The guy/girl could be the cutest person you ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they were the worst nightmare and you hate them with a passion. This also works vice verse. Ex. The guy/girl could be the ugliest person of the time, but you never gave them the time of day. Until you met them and started talk to each other. Thats when you realize that this person is the one for you. Its like saying dont judge a book at its cover. Until you opened it and read it. Thats when you really like this book. Sometimes a personality can be a huge factor on your first impression. Neverless personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly made up of whom you are. The basic qualities, and beliefs you have on a individuals. Find out who someone can be a life changing event for yourself not knowing who someone really is can have a big affect on you, because you really dont know who you are dealing with. Personality provides great insight into individuals and their lives. Being honest no matter what with someone can build a strong first impression on yourself and the person right in front of you. Showing the courage to do whats right in those situations, being loyal at your friends and love ones are good ways to boost you relations with another individual. Having the drive to keep going can rise-up your personality and your first impression to a different climax. Communication is key to your first impression. Furthermore, communication skills consist of verbal and non-verbal by transferring information to another individual. Communication involves displaying confidence, and passion to show that you understand the individual topic by being eye contact and hearing all information that they are telling you. By you giving your honest opinion on a situation can grater your chances being with that individual, when keeping an open mid and resisting to give your quick judgments are clear signs of good communication skills. Additionally. I disagree that first impression is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks, their personality, and their communication skills are all ways that can change your whole point of view on a person. In other words, looks can be deceiving personality because being honest no matter what is key, and communication skills are caused by you first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours, and efforts to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging book by its cover.

259,1041,24DAF94F0A18,"I am sure my heart is raising that I saw a lot of people behavior is going bazaar! Then it is said that your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because it creates trust, shows that your helping others, and creates a positive big impact on others. Your own behavior creates trust is to show that other can respect you and care about you. Friends behavior creates trust because they will sometimes help others. For example, if i have a huge injury and I cant walk, then probably theyll know that Im not joking around and Ill trust them to help me. Another person behavior that creates trust is teachers, their behavior is mostly positive and always influence others. Theyll always care about helping their student and makes the student trust the teacher what they need help on. Even though students think that teacher dont trust them, but others think teachers have faith on others to try hard to help and let them work hard for the future. Also, families creates trust so they will always have influence on me. It like i made their personality more positive than before. Your own behavior creates trust because of helping others, having positive personality, and increase better relationship on others. Showing that you help others is another way to influence other people from your own behavior. Sometimes my families help others and they will never forget about us. Like all of our family went to Generic_City and went on a mission to help others, like we build houses or feed a lot of poor people with food that we made. Another person that help others is friends, they always help me if im in a stress zone. They always comfort me feel better when Im upset or mad. Also, teachers help other because they want the students to past the school. Although some of them might fail, yet teachers try their best to let them past. They want them to try hard so teachers need to make them work hard and help them learn. Like my teachers will try their best to help me past my quizzes or test. Helping others is the best way to influence people like friends, teachers, and families that they will support you and others what they need. The reason why your own behavior creates a big positive impact of others. So more and more people will show respect and will mostly love you. This will create a big positive impact on friends because I show love for them and they will probably love me back. All of us should always show love and care so that they wont hate you. For families, they always have a positive impact because of others positive attitude. Showing a good attitude can be like walking the bridge to their heart. This can help their feeling be better and better. Another person that have a big impact on others is firefighters. They always care about others and their lives so they always protect them when theyre in trouble. There was one story that these firefighters that they need equipment because their tools is rusty and broken, but one person called them for help so they came the house was on fire and the wife is still trapped. So they got her out and she is save. So the husband so so proud, and send them 2,000 dollars a month so the firefighter can bye the equipment. This it to show how much the husband care about them. So this can create a big positive impact because of showing love, fixing feelings, and having risk to protect. Other might say that your own behavior can affect others. It has said that you own be behavior can influence other by showing that you help others create a positive big impact, and creates trust. We should see if others behavior can influence others and change the world. ",6,5,6,6,5,6,486,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

261,1043,AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given. Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them. Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class. Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students. Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do.

262,1044,51DA4BA94C7C,"The research study has shown that there are 25% of people thinks that trying same things over and over can never make you flourish in you life. Some people believed that you always have to try something new everyday, while other believed that they always want to work in something that they always flourished in. Although, doing what they know can make people feel confident but, its salient for us to flourish in our life, because you can learn new things to be successful, you can have more experience, you can also mastered in more things than you are in right now for more opportunity. First, trying new things can help you to be successful, sometimes you inserted that into your mind that you have never done that thing then,you end up saying that you cant do that, but never ever make that egregious decision in you life unless you never try you never going to know. For Example, a friend of mine named Generic_Name, once said that ""Try Try but dont Cry"" it means that dont ever think that you cant do it, you can and you can do it in better way than anyone else dont ever break your confident because of you nervous or for any other reason, but thats not how it works, you just need to fight through whatever reason you had. A myriad of people thinks that when they dont know what to do they always give up instead of trying, but its salient for all of us to put that confident into your mind. Also sometimes it can erroneous your feeling when nobody going to gives work to you because you never have done that work and also you refused to do it. Moreover, it is important for you to have more experience of everything than you have in order to flourish. Experience can make such a difference in what you have learn because it can prepares you from the beginning, so then you cant struggle any more in future, it can be harder at the beginning for some people, but it will get way more easier as you work through it in future. For Example, a student at Generic_school named Generic_Name had said that ""if I take classes that related to my career in high school it can make myself to be prepare for career in future."" It means that he can have a myriad of experience in high school since, he is a flourishing student, also he can learn and experience things very quickly, so then its easy for him when hell going to enter into his own career field. Hell not going to have that much trouble of being in that field like now a days other people have, and also Hell not going to be full of experience when he will go their or how it works, but he can learn basic things that he suppose to have in order to be in that career field. Lastly, you can mastered more than you are right now. If you mastered more their are more opportunity for you to get more scholarships. Scholarships can help you to graduated from high school with more credits and their are more chances for you to get accepted in collages. you can get to the collage that you really want to go into. There are myriad of collages that want you to be more intelligent and have mastered in everything because thats what they stand for since, it higher level of education they need, so its hard if you dont mastered more its not always like how you think that thats going happened sometime collages look for some staff that you never good at, so its important for all of us always be active. Its not fun to mastered more but sometimes you just have to make fun by working hard and putting you best effort into that work. In Conclusion, it is salient to all of us to be good and stay active in everything that we can, because you never know when that all stuff that you have experience on can help you so we just need to be prepare it can flourish your future life. Its better for you to try flourishing from beginning of everything you have to have little bit of experience about everything it can also open up your future door to get success.

For example, if someone is going to vacations, breaks and traveling around the world all the time, they probably dont know that is going on in the present or what are the news of the day , they are not being educate but in this case we are talking about the students so i think if students have really logers breaks all the time they are not going to be educate when they grow up , they are not going to do things by them self because they are not going to know how to do something . second of all, giving breaks to the students all the time its is not good because, they are not going to have a good behavior in their future, some teachers works really hard to teach those students who dosent have the ability to learn like others and when they going to vacations or breaks , all the hard work that the teachers were giving to the students will be gone because, they will not been focusing in school or they will not being focusing in what they were learning about. Also when students go to vacations or breaks they only think about having a great time with friends or family and i know that their are some others kids or students that sometimes are not like those students who dont really care about their future and i honestly think that if all the students could be educate individually will be a really good idea . Finally, i think that the parents really need to know how important is to being educate when u are young because , when a person stars growing up everything in your mind change too. As adult i can say that it is hard to learn things when u get older. Sometimes when you get old, you star getting more lazy but when you are young it gets easy because , the only thing you have to do is study and focusing on school so that is why i think being educate is really important for a human and it is not good to be wasting time in longers breaks or vacations when we can waste all that time doing proyects, homework and activitides in school, and if the students have longers breaks then they will forget the knowledge during the breaks . As a result , i think having longers breaks it not that really necessery for students specially when they are young because, a student dont really need that much time to relaxing or that much time to have a free time doing nothing . Also i can say that a student dont need a really a long break because, when i was in high school the only thing that i needed to be focusing on was in school becuse i wanted to have education, i wanted to have a better life and be a good person in the future. I also think that when you are educate you have more opportunity to get a job. For example , if you are not educate and you want to apply to get a job, the manager it is going to see that you are not educate enough to be working in the place ,so you absolully not going to have a chance to get a job. And i think that is really important for getting a job in whatever place you want to work in, so i really think that the students should not have longers breaks during the school year , that way students will be more polite in school and they will be focussing in learning more things that is going to take them to a better place ,to a better life and to a better future.",5,6,5,6,5,5,817,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
266,1048,524CD617574D,"Do you think success consists of going from failure to failure? Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" In my opinion, when you want to reach your goal or your dream you can fail or success but you shouldnt never give up you should keep trying till you reach your goal. So, I do not agree with Churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of the success. Theres no people that hasnt failed in his/her life at least once but there are some that did success, you only have to work really hard or fight for what you want, and you shouldn never loss your enthusiasm, that is something that people should never forget, to have enthusiasm for something. First, there is not people that has not failed at least once in their whole life. In this world there is a lot of people that had mistaken, failed or disappointed. For example in their goal, getting a job, not getting good grades in school, not succeeding and etc. there is no perfect people that hasnt make any mistake. Failing does not always have to be about your personal life. You could fail your family or friends just by lying them or disappointing them. Maybe there are some people that hasnt failed just few like 1%. I do said this because my cousin, she has never disappointed or failed their parents she has really good grades and have a higher score in school she already graduated with a scholarship. Now she is in Virginia Tech University. In order to reach your goal or your dream, you have to work really hard to success. If you had failed once or more do not get sad or depressed yourself you are strong enough to handle it. There is always an opportunity or another chance that life will give you. Work hard you should never give up easily, fight for what you want reach your big dream. Life is not easy life is hard no one ever has said that life was easy if you want something you have to work hard for it, I know you get drop down(sad) by failing in something but you can get up. If you cant success in something make another plans there is a lot to do and another opportunities that you can get, do not just get stuck in one thing. Look for other things that you want and maybe you will like it and enjoy it. People in this world should never lose their enthusiasm. You are enthusiasm for something go for it do not let other people to do that for you or take it. Enthusiasm is something to appreciate and work hard for it. Not everyone is enthusiasm they dont have that; that interest, that strong warmth of feeling, or that inspired of something you would love to do or have. Be proud of yourself if you are enthusiastic for something. People without it has no feeling for something they dont care about their lives or future they only get what they can do for it, they dont give their feeling for it. They accept what they get. For Instance, when I was a kid I use to be really good at my school I was the best student with good grades, but when I moved here to US I had to start again because I didnt know any English so to success with my English I really had to work hard. In conclusion, I do not agree with Churchills statement. Success does not have to consists of going from failure to failure. You do fail a lot of times but If you dont give up and work really hard you can success for your goal or your big dream. Just never lose the enthusiasm that you have for something, that keeps you up for it, the warmth feeling you have the inspire and interest for it is strong so dont give up. Always work hard for what you want and you will success. Life isnt easy not even for reach people. ",5,6,6,4,4,6,1075,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

268,1050,BDA166D1989A,"The famous artist Michelangelo once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" His quote implies that completing a low goal is far worse that failure. In my opinion, I agree with Michelangelos quote; when people aim too low, they are preventing themselves to have learning experiences. In order for growth and improvement, one must be required to step out off their comfort zone. Because aiming high comes with better resluts, it can serve as motivation to completing a goal. Although one may fail while aiming high, you will gain experience and knowledge from the situation. To begin with, growth comes with attempting to accomplish new things out of your comfort zone. While always staying in your comfort zone, aiming low, you will be confining yourself, which prevents you from improvement. When you set your aim high, it assists with finding out what you are truly capable of. For instance, when working towards a goal, it comes with finding your true self. You can learn about your interests and hobbies, or even new ideas and thoughts that come to mind. When setting you aim high, it improves you as a person and helps with your own growth. Not to mention, aiming high for a goal is possible when you have the right mentality. When you aim high, the results are more motivating than when going for a goal set low. For instance, when achieving to graduate high school, one may aim to graduate as valedictorian. Being the valedictorian comes with great results such as getting into a better college or even just feeling better about yourself. If you put your mind to it, belive in yourself, and work hard towards it you will be able to accomplish any goal. Furthermore, failing at achieving a goal provides experience. When you fail, you can use that situation to understand where you went wrong. In order to succeed the next time you attempt again, you can improve your mistakes. Failing is essential to the learning process as it gives you a chance to better yourself to prevent future mistakes. This knowledge you have accumulated from this certain situation, will be useful if applied to other life problems. On the other hand, when you aim for a low mark, there is no learning lesson you may gain. However, some people believe nothing is wrong with setting your aim low. Instead, they believe that going for a goal set too high is worse as it means it will come with failure. These people view failing as a discouragement as others may consider them as a weak. However, aiming high and failing gives you a life-longing experience by having the chance to improve your mistakes. When attempting again, you will have gained the knowledge to do so. In conclusion, I believe that setting our aim too low and achieving it is far worse than aiming high and failing. For the fact that we need to grow as a person, we can not always stay in our comfort zone. By setting goals too low, we are preventing ourselves to grow and improve. By setting goals to a higher level, we can gain experience and knowledge that comes with the path to achievement.

269,1051,E312449DF480,"I think, first impressions are more effected than other events. Because first reactions are usually hectic. We will not know until we feel something. Somehow, recollections can give you positive or negative effects. If a person had a bad impression, it can gives you anxiety, which is a person needs to get help about negative satiation. It doesnt matter how bad or how good the impressions are, it is important how people get effect. Second, I remember when I was first grade in elementary school, I did not want to go to the school. It was the first day I wanted to stay at home. On that day, I was a little bit bored, I took the big pillows from armchairs then put them together. I was trying to jump from the pillows to the other sofa. The first time I jumped it was successful. After a moment my mom caught me. I was kind of scared, she told me it was dangerous, and I can hurt myself with that. After she left, I put the pillows together like I did it before, then I jumped to the wall. The walls corner was really sharp, and I hit to the wall. I realized I hurt my self so bad. Then I went to my mom, I was holding my head and crying. She was so mad at me, then I took my hands off from my head, it was bleeding so much. She called my dad, then we went to the hospital.

We accomplish more by doing something, because if we do more than what we want or have we will always be growing more. like one time I remember that I was in six grade and I really wanted to participate in the math competition that Generic_Name prepare every year ,only the fastest students in math can participate ,so Generic_Name tell us that they were math reviews after school to practice for the competition ,but I didnt have the opportunity to stay in does reviews ,because every day in the after school I had swimming practice and I couldnt skip because my classes were already paid , so I remember that I was sad and I start thinking that if I really wanted to be in that competition I should do something to be there ,I start to wake up two hours early in the morning and I would practice math and also I will go to the library in lunch to work on math exercises ,but that sacrifice was worth it because when Generic_Name make the list for the people that would be able to participate in the competition my name was there. My mom always tell me that no matter how many times you fail in getting something , because the next time that you tried you wouldnt do the same mistake twice and at the end because of your effort and hard work you will accomplish everything that you want to make in your life. thats something I will remeber the rest of my life. We get more by doing more ,because every single time that we do something ,no matter what its we are going to get something back recompense. when you take your time to do something with patience , will ,and gratitude that can benefit other people by not expecting something back ,we have that selfsatisfaction of making someone happy. like when you see a poor child walking in the streets ,looking for food in the trash ,bacause he is hungry and he doesnt have money to buy some food or maybe he doesnt have a mom that can feed him and you know that you can make that kid happy by giving him some food , because you have that feeling of helping him and make him happy once. one time I remember that I went with my mom to work , we went to clean a house of a 79 year old woman that the only company that she had was her dog , so I remember that I ask my mom if I can come the weekends to her house and join her during the day , and I didnt know that this woman would became someone special for me. she was very sweet ,kind , and lovely woman that i have ever meet in my life , she use to call me grandaugther and I was so happy to get the opportunity to meet her and when the time pass; her son that lives in Generic_City came to country and decide to take her with him and when the moment to say good bye comes, I was really sad because I would not be able to see her again ,but after she left I would always remember the words that she tell me; ""Im living ,but dont worry because you would always be in my heart ,and i will always have in present everytime that you spend with me and make me happy."" that day I learn that when you do something no matter what it is you will always receive something back and that something it can change your life forever. We get more by doing something ,because if we want something and we work hard to get what we want , we create a confidence of ourself, that we know that no matter how hard we have to work to accomplish that ,if we put our effort we can get what we want. like when you are at school and you have alot of assigments to do ,but you still motivate yourself to complete everything that you have to get done and you make the effort to continue until you are done, thats when you realize that you have that confidence of knowing that "" if you purpose yourself you can do everything "". confidence is something that is going to help you in every situation that you are in , it would help you when you are struggleling to take a important decision that maybe it can change your life. I remember when my sister was confused , because she didnt know if she would be able to accomplish the career that she wanted to take in college, and since that day I admire her ,because she believe herself ,she take the career and I knew that she knew that confidence help her to continue fordward and to accomplish what she already know that she wanted ,but at the same time she was scared of taking the challenge and fail. Sometimes we have to take that fear of failling out of our lifes ,and bring that confidence that would help us to belived in ourselfs. Getting more by doing something, is better than dont do anything expecting that we are going to get something. By doing something we will always be growing more than what we are , we would always receive something back and that can be the happiness of another persons , and we would have that confidence to believed in ourself knowing that we can do everything that we want if we work hard for it.

But sometimes we feel forced to do something we dont wanna do or say and its not part of our character, But we feel we have to because there maybe someone watching or it could just be pure pressure, Doing stuff we dont always do that is basically getting influenced by other people because we are doing something that we dont really want to do.

276,1058,70041E13A0CC,"Distance learning was popular, and had so many students and parents chose instead of attend in class. It is convenient and highly support for students in many different way. In the other side, it has a limited things become disadvantage for students who taking classes at home such as communication to solve the problems, competition each other and experiences inspiration from teachers. Those are the most important things school offer to students. It is made valuable that distance learning never could gives to students. The first and the obvious things that students would not benefit from distance learning is communication. Communication is the the person gives and exchanges information to the others, either verbal or non-verbal. For example, some students have watched video, and they still misunderstand and how would they figure out what they have learn, different teachers is different way to teach. Instead of video conferencing, school offers to students time to see teacher, professor to discuss their problems and find out what they were struggling with. That is why communication so important that distance learning can not offer to students. The second advantage to being in class instead at home is competition. Competition is person versus or competitive with another person or group, each of which is trying to do better than all of the others. The best example is the one student in class got an highest score test, the others will do whatever it takes to get higher that score was. School always creating the competitive for students to participate, and that way makes students get more interesting at work help them to prepare for examination. That is the reason why competition is necessarily and advantage that distance learning would not have to offer students at home. The last thing students could not get from online classes or video conferencing is the experiences and inspiration from teachers, professors. The experiences is the knowledge or skill gather from the pass; the inspiration is person with confidence and desire to do something that makes the the other people follow. During the class, not just the lesson from the math or English or Science, students would receive a life lesson from their teacher. Teachers could share the experience from their pass and motivation student who has the same the path, then students would not struggle with the same mistake they did. That was the most valuation that students can not get anywhere except in class. Eventually, classes give students a lot of thing that they would not benefit from being at home. Attend to class offer students communication to easier solve their problems, created competition place for students and experiences inspiration from the teachers for students have a better way to learn. Those things that online learning students would never received. class is not just a lesson, it is also the small society that students should have before the real life.

Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldnt give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success. If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who dont lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain theyve claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice. In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm.

Because, it described us by having a good conduct, a positive personality, and a attitude. This is something the help us to have a good success in life. Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive. My first reason is having a good conduct it help us to be a better person, every where we go. Because, is going to be useful For example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us. My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It help us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can asked the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works so we can improved our grades. My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend friend to find a new job were I work. So, she got a interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude so they will might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others. We always need to have a good attitude so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us.

Summer vacation had been the same for many years, summer vacation is when teenagers take a break from school to enjoy what they like to do during their free time. By having a long summer vacation, does not affect students to retain information from the past. teens should know that summer vacation is when they can enjoy their break to do what they want for fun.

There is so many good and bad effects allowing students use their phone for educational puroposes .They can be more bad reasons than good reason beause we have to think how really they are going to use their cellphones, and if its for educational purpose. I think allow their cellphones to students is not a good idea because we know that we are young people, and we are not going to use our phone just for educational purposes; we are going to use :our apps , social media ,and that is going to distract our attention in class, makes us faild or test because weare not using our resource for good reason; we know there are students without resposabilities and thats what make cellphones a bad opction. Some people may think that use our phone in classes can be a good idea because we are going to have more access to technology at school, and more easy research for our classwork. Also people think that we are going to have more privacity for our work. Students said that they can be resposinble at the moment to use their chellphones just for educational purposes. Allowing cellphones for students can have good and bad effects , it can have good effects because is a easy option for students having their phone for: research information resources, have easy acess to internet ,see videos educationals abut the subject, and find deep information about the subject. The bad effect for students can be :they are going to get distracting , they are not going to do their classwork,and for all that reasons they can lose their classes. My first reason is cellphones in class are not good tools for students ,because cellphones distract and make students lose their attention to class. My second reason is cellphones is not a thing that we need for learn because our parents, teachers ,family in their time was no cellphone ,and they learn by other resources like books ,so is not a thing that we really need. there are computers we can use them for when we really needed . My third reason is that cellphone is not necessary for our educational purpose because we can have better resources than a cellphone ; we have the most beautiful thing in this world and that are books our better resource. Some schools allow their students to use their cellphone to a educational purpose they think that is a good idea to have cellphones in their classroom but in my opinion is a distracting thing ,and is not necessary for our educational purpose ; we have good tools for example one are the books and internet but not using our cellphones at class because we know that we are not goin to use for educational purpose, and cellphone are going to distract us.

287,1069,D96EF27304E5,"Should schools control how many extracurricular activities you take? There should be a certain extent in when schools can control how many out of school activities your in. The students family should be the deciding factor in whether you leave or not. That is if you start to fail classes, your parents ask the school to take you out of some, or if your attendance towards the meetings look bad. Then that is when the school helps decides what happens towards the student. First of all, I think it should be a certain extent in what you can enroll for but it should always be up to the student and their families since that is a major factor inn deciding what to do. If the family thinks the child has no time to do homework or study for upcoming test then they should talk to the student about the issue and hear what the student has to say. If the family decides on letting the child continue is upon them but if they chose to take their child out of the extracurricular activities the must notify the childs guidance counselor and notify the main person in the activity However, if the students starts to fail classes or most of your grades keeps dropping the the students guidance counselor should talk to the student and see why. If they see to many extracurricular activities then there should be a talk with the student to see which ones he can drop for the time until the grades are up. This should encourage the student that if they want to be a part of the activities the they have to be able to maintain their grades. Lastly, if the childs attendance to the meetings are bad and are inconstant they should not be allowed to participate in the extracurricular activities. The child should only miss up to five meetings per month with out any consequences. By making the child leave the club and notifying their parents the reason why then should the child be kicked out. Without furthermore, reasons the child could be suspended from coming to the meetings for a certain amount of time. In conclusion, the school should have very little say in the decision of a student being apart of a extracurricular activity. More or less said the families have the most say in the deciding factor unless the students grades are dropping or starts to fail some of their classes. Their attendance towards meetings are bad or if they just dont go to any meetings. ",7,7,7,7,7,7,3045,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

296,1078,523130079501,"""Their are advantages of cell phone usage in class but their even more disadvantages to it."" cell phones arent great for students to use in classroom because it cause distraction and make students not focus while teachers give instructions. Teenagers get so easily distracted by anything because they are careless and arent aware. Phones arent beneficial nor useful. Students should use either school or home laptop it is more beneficial and useful than cell phones and in that ways teachers will be easily find out what they have done in class. First of all, the reason why cell phones arent useful for students in classroom for educational purpose its because of distraction; that will bother the whole class ,and might bother teachers too. Since cell phones are one of the rule to be use in class then all have to follow it. For instance, if teacher assign work for students to do during class on their phones imagine what will be the result nothing might be done by the end. Laptops have big screen so that teachers can follow up with their students. With cell phones is difficult for teachers to know weather or not the student have done something in class. Students have good tricks especially teenagers. They might be acting like they are working but truly they are messaging ,and once the teacher approach he/she change the page so they can show evidence that they are working. Teachers are even smarter they know how to deal with students like this. They either sit with them to help them out or ask to come after school if they really struggle and cant do nothing. In this situation is a good idea for teachers to collect phone before class starts and hand them back by the end. Any advice could be more useful then cell phone. That is also the reason why cell phones arent beneficial. Additionally, cell phones arent always beneficial the reason why is because it distract easily. It cause problems between students. For example, if their are two students playing soccer on their phone how will they focus; they cant control themselves one shout happy scores ,and the one who lost want to beat the other guy who win and so on. Cell phones shouldnt be use at all in class but only with teachers permission. It will be even better if two teachers help out in the class with work. They both will help students pay attention and participate. Both together will be able to control phones usage. It is hard when you are working on an essay and suddenly a message pop up you cant control yourself ,and you cant focus just because of the message you are carious and really want to know what is happening. That is the reason why cell phones shouldnt be use in class just because of distraction and the impact that might happen to students from using it. However not everyone agree, some argue that cell phones is great to be use in schools for educational purposes. First think about the disadvantage that could happen with this use or rule. Think about others and how that might effect them. Will you be able to control yourself if you receive a text from a friend?. In fact, there are many things that might cause distraction but one of the biggest distraction are cell phones ,however, any other things can be control. Any other device will be okay because it will easy to be seen by teachers. Cell phones wont help you at all however it will bring your grades down and it will bother you. Not everyone have same opinion other have positive view on the use of cell phones. Which is okay but think about it more. Look to its positive and negative impact on students and you fill find the answer. Why most students will agree with the use of cell phone in class?. Some student arent always aware of what they are doing and they are careless. They think messaging or whatever they are doing in class is more important then their grades. Students should avoid all distraction such as food, cell phones, and music to help our society develop. If all students focus and pay attention that will have a huge impact on the environment.",7,7,8,6,6,7,1073,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
297,1079,8C83ACEF2A15,"I agree that some district offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of 4, some students dont have enough money or they dont want to go to college. Their parents work day and night if they got out of high school with a diploma they will be able to work full time and help their parents with money or even move out of the house and start living independently, another reason is that teenagers would be more mature for their ages and learn everything they need to know to be successful in life. Nowadays employees are looking for young adults to work for them but also with experience, that means if students graduates in three years they could gain experience by working on a restaurant,store et in one year. Other teenagers will go to college or university if they know what they want to study and know what they want to be, they will graduate at a good age not young, but not that old,they would have more time, energy, and interest. Some teenagers just dont want to be at school for years they dont like school, this program help them have more time to experience, try new things, prepare them for what they want to do and how they want to do it.

It really hard to teach young kinds because some older student dont even remember the work from any grade like me some time time my little sister be like can you please help me in be like am sorry dont even remember it really difficult to teach a young student. Older kinds have difficult time to teach young kinds they have different way that there teacher teach them how to there work. It really hard to know there work in explain the way we explain the kinds the better they understand what they supposed to do.We have to have a lot of passion to do it. 2.I think many student dont really get it because they older student some student dont really get it some of them dont get it fast but some of them need more extra work with it.Older student some time they explain good more then the teacher but for me it better in adult because will ask question in they know well because they teacher. Like some time i explain my sister what is bad but some time i dont know so I ask in adult to explain me really well that how in school work to young kinds may not really get the older kinds a younger need a adult to understand it well. 3.I go to a program is about math but i really understand because we share opinions of different work they do like student have com plenty different work they have it the hard way in the easy way student get more confused when they have com plenty different work like my math teacher I have different completely different work. I dont understand her nothing at all but I think because different language but asking some else in the program she explain the easy way i cant understand her. 4. Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program. 5. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. The most important is if the young student get it if they dont get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it.

299,1081,4E91C3BA11D0,"Imagine being a new sixth grade student in middle school and, not knowing the expectations nor, knowing anything about the place you are around. Elementary students should need to know what will go on in middle school and its expectations. So explaining it will make it easier for sixth grade students. once coming to middle school First of all, students should know about the class room expectations. Middle school student should be respectful, responsible, and productive. Kids should know better than to play around ,or ignore teachers and ignore their work. Students should come to school ready to learn not to play around. Kids should be quiet while a teacher is talking and should also be silent while taking a test or quiz. They shouldnt be throwing stuff around the room or be yelling or screaming. When i used to talk i would get in trouble but, i would always listen to the teacher. Second of all, students should know about halls and lockers expectations. While walking in the halls kids should be safe. Students should not run in the halls and, should not push and shove other kids. Because students could get injured. At your lockers you should get your things for the next class and not talk to your friends in the hallways. If you cant open you locker ask a teacher near by. But you shouldnt kick your locker. If i couldnt get my locker open i would just ask a teacher to help me. Dont kick or slam you locker respect the schools things because it provides you with the things you need to learn with. Last but not least, you must know the lunch expectations. During in line to get your lunch you shouldnt be touching everything nor, keep a hold up in the line. Be productive and get your lunch fast then take a seat at you table. If you need anything raise your hand dont get up with out permission. Dont throw food at people pick up your trash once you leave and, dont make a mess. While eating you should stay in you own seat and not at others tables. Once i would go to lunch i would get my food fast then take a seat with my friends at my table. In the cafeteria it is super loud so try not to scream or yell because it will be extra louder if you do. In conclusion this is why teaching kids about middle school is a good lesson to teach elementary school students. So that once they go to middle school they would be ready. The students would already know most of the school expectations and how things work around.",6,7,8,7,7,6,1029,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
300,1082,7101C080C12C,What if your school wanted to add one hours and a half would you agree or disagree? I presently think that no one would like that like dont like that idea at all and let me tell you why I would int like that. First if you dont like school that much like me you would do what ever you can to stop that. Most likely be that people will get tired really fast. Finally not that much people would come to school they would not like it even more. Some ways you might like this is that. They might add a day to the week end which would be more days per week end that sounds good to me. Another thing that they can do is add lease day to the school year I think that people would really like that and other ways are. You learn a lot more thing for next year which is really help full for the next year of classes you have. Finally you simply like school you like seeing friends in school and you like learning more things. How you may be able to stop it? will first you have to go to your principle and him/her how you can you stop this form going on well they might say get a exact amount of people to sign a paper. Well then if they ask you to do that then you know that you have to ask every one in the school to sign the paper if you really dont want this to happen. First you know you got to go to you best friends and people that dont really like to stay in school that long. However if its not that much people yet you know you have to go to every one in the school asking them if they dont want a hours and a half to be added and at the end of that i might have the number you need of people. Do you want this to happen at your school but your school isnt do it? Well like the other one go to your principle and ask them if they can add another hour and a half but and another day to your week end or less day of the school year. See if other student want to join you if they want less day of the school year or a another day addend to the week end like a Monday because every hates Mondays right. If a lot of people agrees you might get this to happen in you school. However there is going to be some one to not like you idea and they might go wrong for you but I think you can get this. So now that you know how to do this it say do it. If you want this to happen then ask your principal if this can happen in any way. If you want it to happen in your school then do it. If its happening but you dont want it to happen then stop it. However think what is going to happen if i do it so think what your going to do before you do it. ,7,6,6,6,6,6,1464,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
301,1083,CEAD27DE3263,"We tend to accomplish more if we always do something. In my opinion, I think that if people want to accomplish more, then they would do more to make their lives better. For example, a teen who gets eight hours of sleep before school wont be tired then a teen who slept for three hours. The teen who slept more will accomplish a successful school year because he slept earlier. Responsibility is a big role of being able to accomplish something; unfortunately, not everyones responsible. There are many ways someone can accomplish something, but they all start out with them taking action. as an example Im going to use Steve Jobs and Bill Gates. Both of these men started out with nothing. no one knew who these two men were 13 years ago. But that all changed when both of them announce their new technology. If it werent for them, no one would have these useful items: IPhone, Android, Xbox, Window computers, etc. However, the reason they accomplished all that, was because they both studied and worked hard. Inactivity can also serve a purpose in a person in my opinion. I think that people who do not want to accomplish something is because they do not want to push themselves into doing so. Another reason I think that theyre not pushing themselves is because they dont have anyone to support them or help them out. Those are two main reason why I think people are inactive. In conclusion, we do accomplish more if we are always doing something. you cannot simply do nothing and wait for it to be accomplished by itself. everything thing you do now will lead to a bigger accomplismnet. If you want to be sucessful, you always have to do something, Even though its little things like helping your parents cook, or washing the dishes.

302,1084,F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldnt attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home. Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think its much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment. One reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because its difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didnt pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. Its undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade. Another reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasnt like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didnt see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he wont come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I cant say if its a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasnt like to talk. In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldnt attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life.

They also knew that they could use more practice on thier shooting skills on the goalily. This shows that, the soccer team didnt want to waste time on something that they could be practeing for. Clearly, Futhermore, accompish something on homework. This proves that, a college student wants to get their homework all done because they want to go do something fun with their friends.

306,1088,2286BCFF86EB,"Generic_Name was sitting in the cafeteria listening to music refusing to touch her plate of food, why was she like that? Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didnt. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses. First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didnt know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Names teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didnt know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes. Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good hell be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney. Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it. In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

To grow more as a person people have to try different things because the most things they do the more experience they get. If a person mastered something already he will feel that he know everything but the true is that he only know whay he mastered, but if a pereson try different thing he would get more experience that can be use in the future. an example of this is Pique. He is a famous soccer player. he get pay a lot of money, but to grow more as a person. he also become a busines man. Now Pique have a lot of companies that work for him. he also created his own Tennis league in Spainh. Pique also support a fundation that his wife created to help kids in Colombia. Other example is one of my uncles from Generic_City. his mane is Generic_Name. He study to be a teacher. He was very happy with his work, but to grow more and get more knowledge he go back to college to study to become a doctor. Now he feel like he know more and that he have grow more as a person. I also like to thing that Im a example of this. I always try to do my best to leard different sports. Im a really good soccer player, but I prefere to try others sports. I play a different sport everyday because I feel that this will help me to become a better player and will give me the experience to grow more as a athlete. I also like to to study a lot for the classes that Im having problems because I get more knowledge about different topics and make me grow more as a student . People can still growing when they mastered something. An example of this is Leonel Messi. he is a soccer. he has play soccer all his lifes. He always was getting better and better every year. he never play other sport in his lifes. Now he is considere one of the best player in the world. He grow as a person by doing what he already mastered. people have to do different things in their lifes if they want to grow as a person because if they think they are the best is a lie. They are the best in what they mastered, but they dont have any type of knowledge in other thing. In conclution if someone wants to grow more as a person.

309,1091,F88A0801C9EB,"In my opinion it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age. If youre committed to anything you will always want to achieve that certain goal. Having a career you are committed to at a young age has many positive outcomes. One of the outcomes is you can find a career much faster. Another positive outcome is having a goal that you want to achieve. The final positive outcome is having more time in high school to do other activities. Having a certain career you want to achieve at a young age will make you improve on lots of things. You will find a career much faster if youre committed to one specific career at a young age. If you are focused on that certain career you will be doing things that you need to achieve to have that certain career you have been planning at a young age. For example when you are committed to that one certain career you will be taking specific classes. Finally when you sign up for that career or try out for that career you will most likely get accepted since you will have experience. Having experience on a career will help you so much when applying for a career. People will most likely see that you have experience and want to hire you. That is why it is better having a career you are committed to at a young age. If you have a goal you want to achieve at a young age you will do anything to achieve that goal you since youre committed to achieve that goal. It is also just like being committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in order to achieve a goal you will need to do anything it takes to achieve it. As in a career you need to study as much as you can of the career and take classes that will help you achieve the career you are interested in. If you have a goal you will most likely achieve the goal if you try and never give up. If you give up on the goal you will not succeed. Just like in a career you are committed to at a young age. If you give up on the career you will most likely need to find another career and learn new things and start all over. That is why you should have a career already planned at a young age so you wont give up later on and need to start all over. You will have more time in high school to do more activities if you are committed to a certain career at a young age. For example in high school their are many sports , clubs , and other after school activities you can do or tryout for. If you already have a certain career in mind since you were little and young you can have more time to do sports and other activities that can also help achieve that certain career you are interested in. Also it is good having more time to do other things instead of still not knowing what career you want and having to speak to counselors , teachers , and searching up careers you are interested in doing. If you already planned your career when you were young you wont have to worry about having to look for a career and having to stress out. Some students stress out if they dont have a career in mind and not knowing what career they want to do. Having more time to yourself and not needing to worry about finding careers is much better than looking for careers and needing to take new classes to have that certain career that you are just planning to have. That is why it is better to be committed to a career at a young age. Overall having a career to be committed to at a young age is better than not having any career planned out for the future. You will get the career quicker than usual. You will have an achievement you will want to accomplish. You will have a better schedule to do and focus on other things. This will improve lots of your characteristics and improve you as a person. It will show you how committed you are and how you can get anything done. When you get the career youve been committed to since you were young you will be proud of yourself since you have been committed and focus on that career like all your life.

But we do that when we have a bad attitude but why I said in my head we never have a good attitude in diffcult time in current time,but long time it was lit beacuse we have good attitude because we awalys go to the park and play soccer. We have great time even if it was raining long time ago we have good attitude in diffcult time.

This is why good attitude in difficult time will be the best and help you succed in life. ",6,7,5,6,6,5,1110,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Students stays for homework help, finish their homework early, and turn in their homework on time. So ,we all have our homework to turn in on the next day. Theyre a lot of students that do their homework, dont do it, or some students might said, ""I forgot my homework."" Should people bring their homework to school? Of course, or what, youre just going to leave it at your house and forget to bring it at school. Always do your homework and do your homework at home or afterschool. On the next day, just prepare to turn in your homework and if you forget to bring your homework, ask your teacher and give a good reason why you left your homework. Then you can turn in your homework on the next day. People need help on their work. Thats why they needed an afterschool homework club. They can go to their teacher to help what they need. If they go to afterschool and get a good helper, then they can be better and will know what they learn at afterschool. We can improve all of the students to get a good knowledge and success, to be a good students. So students needs to turn in their homework and get a good grade. So, if you want that grade, you have to achievement and pass the class and get good grades. Turning your homework is one of the important grades to success and go your grade up. You can help other students that needs help on a subject. Why, because helping someone will learn from you and they will know how to solve a problem. They might do something and turn in. Thats why people needs a good grade and be smart on something they known. Now that the students have an afterschool, they can go and learn what they need help on something. Then they can remember, how to do a problem. We all can be nice and treat like if its like you.",6,7,7,7,6,7,3818,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
312,1094,4EECC9B3CF7F,"Can people accomplish more if they are doing something? yes, the more people thrive to be active the more they will accomplish. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Although some say being inactive serves a purpose, nevertheless, if people are doing something productive they will accomplish more because they will become active and gives self confidence. To begin, many people are inactive which does not serve them a purpose. For example, everyone is doing something on their agenda weather its working, school, or shopping. People are accomplishing daily tasks everyday. This shows that, when people are doing something it serves them a purpose to be active which helps accomplish goals. Clearly, if people do not commit to becoming active they will not accomplish many goals. Furthermore, this gives people confidence and assurance that goals or tasks will be fulfilled. For instance, when being active while accomplishing goals people start to have confidence and assurance that being active can help with accomplishments. This proves that, people are best when active because they become confidant with themselves. Overall, while not being active and doing something productive people will not see the potential they have. In conclusion, when humans are doing something, they accomplish goals which help them develop confidence and can measure how much they are active.

Some people might say that taking classes at home cant benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there ,taking classes at home can benefit students because their can have more time to sleep and their dont need to take a bus or walk. In the first place ,attend classes at home cant benefit students because when their need help or have some question any teachers can be there. For example , I have a cousin who take classes at home but he never know anything because no body can help him when he have a question. While, always I tell him that if he have a problem I can help him or another option is that he dont taking classes at home anymore. Also he dont make friends because he do not go to the schools. I choose this option because a lot of student waste their time taking classes at home. I am agree that attend classes at home not have benefit. likewise, attend classes at home can benefit students because their can sleep more. In my case, if a have the opportunity to take classes at home im happy because I love sleep a lot. For example,the twenty-five of the student get classes at home because dont like to make a friends or their believe that their can do the work along. The classes start early so in this way they do not have to wake up early. Also, if people sleep more their can be more healthy this is the reason because student like to take classes at home to be more healthy. I choose this option because is important remember that many students want to sleep more or get extra time because their have a job and is hard to them do two thing at the same time .For this reason many student choose take classes at home. In addition,attend classes at home can benefit because student dont need to take bus or walk. For example,some student do not have to take bus because are more near to the school. In my case, I have to walk from my home to my schools sixteenth minutes every single day. when winter come and is so cold outside its not good to walk in this temperature. while , this is the reason because students take classes at home although sometime cant benefit. Another reasons is that some students have to take the public buses so is take classes at home dont have to take bus. I choose this reason because many people forget that many time is not easy for the students do that. Finally,everything have advantage and disadvantage because some schools think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home and some schools are disagree. Also some students work a lot so their can benefit with this opportunity. Although, attend classes at home is not the same thing like go to schools and receive help from teachers, students, etc. In addition, if some schools offer this opportunity have to think about it and look the best option.",6,5,6,6,5,6,2304,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

316,1098,8C01B86DE888,"Homework Clubs Imagine getting all of your work completed easily and correct! A homework club are for students that is having a difficult time of getting their work done, they can also do their work together as a class. Homework clubs are good for students because they can finish it early, they can help each other, and it improves their learning skills. First, students finish early. Students can do something else later instead of homework, and it helps them avoid of getting a late work. For example, back in 7th grade, I didnt really do my homework and I knew that I didnt make the right choice so the consequences were having a bad grade, and being grounded for a long amount of time. I really didnt like doing homework but I learned something from it so I started doing my work since I was grounded. Second, students can help each other. Students can help the ones that are having a difficult time of doing their homework, they can also finish their work easily. For example, when I stayed after school for my English teacher to do work, I realized that I finished most of my work because I was focused and I asked the teacher multiple times to help me with some of the work. It helped me bring my grades up from a failing to a passing. So I suggest that students should do homework clubs to get their work done. Third, It improves their learning skills. It improves their collaboration, and it improves their communication skills, and it can improve their skills on every subject. For example, when I was in 4th grade, I didnt know a single word in English so I was in this program called, English and Second Language, where they taught me new words everyday until I started talking English in class and to other students. It helped me came along this far where I didnt need it anymore. I was scared to talk to people because I thought that they would make fun of me because I didnt know how to talk, but I was wrong. I made my first friend in 5th grade and his name was Etka, we were both at the program but he knew a lot more English than me so he also helped me improve my communication skills along the way. I think that after school homework clubs are good for students because students can finish it early with the help of one another and the teacher. The most important thing about this club is that it improves your learning skills and your communication skills.",9,7,8,7,7,9,1859,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Sometime we spend time doing think that can not benifict our future. for Example if I am skiping clases from school the problem will be the my teacher will call my parent and I will get in trable. another reason can be skiping clases will effect my life and my future that can effect my goal. another type of effect can be like if I want to fiend a good job the company where I am working will pay me less. or I can not have the same benefit like other people that graduate from school. people make thing without think. sometime we make bad choses. for Example in my home country when I was going to school I was making one big bad chose. I was skiping clase with my friend to go play soccer but the problem was that I dont think first. The result was I dont pass the clase my grade where bad and they call my parent and I get in drable. people should think first after they want one to make a chose. people spend time in think that in the future can effect them. for Example in my opion sometime we make bad chose. another Example my brother when he was in TCW. he was in 9 grade he make a big error he spend more time with his friend and he tallk me the hi dont care about the SOL but when he was in 12 grade he need to pass the SOL to graduate. he tallk me please dont make the same error the I make.

Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldnt be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school. From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then theyll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then theyll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesnt care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn. Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teachers permission to do a video conference. Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because thats part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if theres a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break.

321,1103,BA71C09852E8,"Generic_Name is a student that just finished middle school and is getting prepared to start high school. He is really excited to find a career throughout high school and knowing which one would suit him best. Unfortunately after he told his parents, they were not amused with his response. Generic_Name was sad that his parents didnt encourage him and wasnt as excited to find a career as he was before. Although some people think that it is ridiculous for students to identify a career at a young age, they are wrong. Students with benefit in knowing to identify a career because this will improve their knowledge, learn new skills, and teaches them how to make their own decisions. Students will be able to improve their knowledge whenever starting high school because this will get students to be prepared for any task at any time. Students are also going to be noticing that there are more opportunities throughout the school and have the option to choose what suits them best. Students can be able to notice that high school many students really improve from freshman year to senior year and can compare how much they really care about the students education. For example, Generic_Name is a sophomore and is looking at a career to become an English teacher, but he hasnt really improved as much in his English class. He talked to his English teacher about it and wanted to get tutored and really know how to become a teacher. In less than two months, Generic_Name has improved so much in English and is finally understanding what to do and feeling confident that in the future he will become a teacher. Students will also benefit at finding a specific career if they learn new skills. Students will be able to learn so much throughout high school and especially learn new skills. Many students whenever they start high school they can learn new skills, for example: playing an instrument, playing a sport, or even learning how to cook. Students will also learn new basic skills, weather its Math, Science, or History. Students can also learn new skills if they could join a club or activities throughout the school. Students will have the opportunity to learn all of these skills and could really help them out to find a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is a senior and wants to find a career about becoming a guitarist, but his teachers were concern due to how magnificent he is with Technology and Science. Generic_Name wasnt really interested in those careers and has told his teachers that he wants to play for the world. The teachers were upset with Generic_Name but understood that he made his decision and were still happy and proud of him. Generic_Name was glad he finally found the perfect career for him and was very happy with it. Students will have the chance to make their own decisions in high school. High school really wants students to make decisions and teach them that they are becoming young adults and need to understand that they can also make decision on their own. Students will be able to have the decision to go for a standard diploma or an advanced diploma. Students also have the opportunity on weather to choose to go to the army or work whenever they finish high school. Another decision students will get is what career will suit best for them. Teachers really help out students with finding the right and best career for students. For example, Generic_Name is a freshman and really wants to graduate with an advanced diploma. She is doing really well in all her classes and teachers are recommending her many careers. Generic_Name decides to go to see her counselor about which career would she enjoy best. Her counselor tells her that it is her decision on what does she really like to do and recommends her great careers. Generic_Name really struggles on what to choose but will sooner or later realize what she wants to do. Students will be able to achieve more intelligence, learn more tasks, and open new opportunities for students to know how to identify a career. Generic_Name started high school and isnt too happy about it. He is doing decent in his classes but isnt feeling confident about finding a career, but one day whenever he got home his parents decided to find him careers and told him that they have all their support and will encourage him no matter what. Generic_Name is filled with joy and encouragement that he started to improve in his classes and is starting to find a career that knew that he would love and enjoy. He went to go talk to his counselor about careers and Generic_Name heard so many options he didnt know what to choose, but in the end he finally made up his choice and chose the career he know he would love.

In the follows paragraphs I would like to tell you what I think about this issue because i believe that everyone got opinions or some ideas about this new ""proposal"" as well. First, I would like to discuss if this ""proposal makes sence to me or not and wich are the advantages and disadvantages. First thing I may say is the advatage and the disadvantage that we probably can see or find in the proposal. One adventage that comes along with this proposal is one schools day less. If the school follows the whole proposal; we can say or expect that friday or anyday will be off; wich means no school for us. In addition, we will have three days free. So, we can spent more time donig what we most love or enjoy. In the other hand, we have the disadvantages. I personally found one hugh disadvantage, the time. I personally think that the time that we will spent in the school is alot. Just think about it , how do you going to fell staying about 10 hours in the same place , spacially when that plece is not home. You might be get uncomfortable, or little irritable. Secondly, I totally agree with the proposal because we gonna get more help on schools subject wich is good for us. Also we will avaible to do more school activities such as sports, fell trips, math stuff or any other amazing things. Besides, we will learnd more things such as lenguague stuff. like I said in my las sentence more time in the school could works for many of us. Lastly, One more day free. We gonna spent more time in school, but at the same time we also can get one more day free. Folllowing the proposal we also can get other day free like Saturday or Sunday wich is good for us because that day could be any day of the week. So, this means that we are avaible to do more thinghs that we most enjoy or love, for example, play videogames , go to the park , take wallks and other amazing things. Conclusion, the new proposal has a good advantages over the disadvantages. I completly agree with this and I am sure the proposal is benefial and will work for us. Also, we will save energy and resources , at the same time we gonna get benefits from it. ",7,7,6,6,6,5,424,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

But yet again here we are learning from our own mistakes why try to make our self just what others want us to be, why cant we just be us for just simply pleasing ourselves I wish we wouldent care what people think about us but do , but we have to face reality sadly weather we like it or not theres no alternatives. Because whats the point?, just to be something we are not, for example one we would be lying to ourselves and second either way no matter how much we try its never enough for anyone because at the end of the day how we choose to be either our self or not nobody will ever be pleased with our decisions not the other way around. Sometimes our influences may proswade us and to a sertin point we try so hard not to fit in but the people that we hang around the most we reflect upon them even if we see it or dont at the end of they day they try but the real question is do they succeed? yes but only temporary nothing lasts forever everything has its timing when it should or wont come to our lives. I mostdefinlty agree to being yourself is a huge accomplishment, but we might not understand at the moment, how or why but we will soon rather then later at first its complicated even difficult although its just tempawarly things that accur in that priest moment it can also be for our great or good but we shouldve been proud of what dident thad happen. So i believe sticking with yourself is always the best policy dont worry what people say about you, you know where you stand dont let anyone tell you so plus being yourself will mark the difference in you people cant always tell what you are they dont define you thats for you to decide not them,So dont be embarrassed of yourself show yourself off believe in yourself because your limit is and only you. Thank you for your time hope to hear from you very soon. Sincerely Generic_Name ",4,4,5,6,5,5,1507,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
324,1106,85C54BD4D416,"Thomas Jefferson, writer of the Declaration of Independence and founding father of the United States, once said, ""Determine never to be idle...it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" In Jeffersons eyes, a world spent in constant work and motion represents a more productive and accomplished world. However, there is merit in a world that does not work without break and resolves to be idle at times. A world that is always working may also be a world that is burning out, diminishing the value of building connections and reflecting. A world that is idle when it recognizes its need to be has more value than a world that is always working, as it allows time for cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration. In the body, the brain represents an entity that is constantly developing, creating new ideas, and planning for the future. If a human was always working, there would be no time to create new ideas or plan. The potential of the human brain would reduce, as the human brain would never have the time to step back and reflect on its past experiences and how it wants to reflect lessons learned from those experiences in the future. For example, if Thomas Jefferson had not taken time off to create new ideas and plan for his country before writing the Declaration of Independence, the United States would be very different from the way it is today. Every idea would be thought of on the spot, and the potential ramifications and consequences of each idea would not be carefully taken into consideration. In addition, the human brain requires breaks to keep working, just as the human body needs sleep to continue on the next day in a healthy state. Time spent idle does not equal time spent wasted; time spent idle is time spent reflecting, planning, and developing. Time spent being idle carries the potential to be a valuable learning experience to the human life, as well. In colleges, the requirements for acceptance do not only include academic excellence - they also include extracurriculars and attention to when the brain needs a break. If students did not take time off to develop, their potential for achievement in life would reduce. Therefore, a world spent constantly working does not always represent a world of accomplishment. Some argue that if one is not always working, then one cannot accomplish as much as one can, as a minute spent idle could lead to a day spent idle, and so on. Contrastingly, if one is always working, then one has a much greater risk of crashing. Mental health is an essential reason as to why the world today does not and cannot constantly work as Jefferson wants it to. Many studies show that top students in classes, those who never stop working towards their goals, can have a greater risk of developing depression, anxiety, or addiction to drugs. This is because their brains cannot comprehend the constant work, and moves to other unhealthy tactics of releasing emotions. Several stories in the world detail the downfall of the most intelligent people, simply because the never took a break for themselves. Furthermore, if ones life is spent constantly working, ones brain is exposed to extreme competition and high standards. These two concepts are unhealthy for the human brain, as one may believe that they actually are not working hard enough and need to work themselves even harder, when reality shows that they already work themselves unhealthily. This concept ties in with the concept of unhealthy comparison, which further proves why mental health is one of the largest reasons as to why the world cannot constantly work. Those who always work also always compare themselves to others who are working, and often times do not take into account that what they are doing is very unhealthy. All of these concepts combined greatly heighten the chance in the deterioration of mental health. A world spent working constantly is a world exposed to bad mental health. Finally, if the world is spent constantly working, then there is no time for inspiration of any sort. If ones brain is constantly in a working state, it will never spend time appreciating the beauty of the world around it and taking in inspiration for future plans. A prime example of this concept is the work of artists. If an artist such as Vincent Van Gogh or Claude Monet was constantly working, said artist would never spend time collecting inspiration, and the work of said artist would be mediocre instead of beautiful and inspiring. Inspiration flows from person to person, and if everyone was working constantly, no one would serve as a source of inspiration for others around them. Also, brainstorming represents one of the most important parts of formulating any plan for any person in any situation, and constant work does not allow time for that brainstorming and inspiration to occur. In schools, teachers emphasize the necessity of brainstorming before writing, and this concept is emphasized so much because inspiration is what leads to the development of mankind. Role models also result from the need for the world to take a break, as it allows for humans to gather inspiration from others and plan how they want to lead their lives. Thus, if the world was constantly working, there would be no inspiration. Without inspiration, the world would not be where it is today. Cognitive development and reflection, mental health, and inspiration represent three of the most essential reasons as to why the philosophy of Thomas Jefferson cannot apply to how the world works today. Constant work leads to stunted development, deteriorated mental health, and no sources for inspiration. Without time spent being idle, the inventions, buildings, ideas, movies, and other parts of the world today would have never come to fruition. A person always working does not represent a person living life to the fullest. The United States and our world today would not be the same without time spent idle,",9,10,10,9,10,10,1766,"conventions 10, grammar 10, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 9"
325,1107,200671752EE0,"Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something? Yes we accomplish more if were always doing something but only if what were doing benefits us. Why? Because if were always doing something then we would succeed more in life, we would always be active and doing something productive. But it also depends on what kind of activities your doing and if what your doing is going to benefit you later on in the future. Because if what your doing isnt benefiting your future then theres no point of doing something that doesnt help you out for later on in life. For example sports, if your always doing sports then that would be great way to benefit your future and also a good way to stay active. The reason I say this is because by playing sports you could have many different opportunities. Like getting scholarships into different universities, especially if youre great at playing the sport. And also its another way to help you stay fit because your always doing some type of exercise in any kind of sport. So that brings me to my next example. Another example is exercising, if you like exercising, going to the gym and just being active in general then thats another great thing to do thatll help you accomplish and benefit your future. Why I say this is because by being active its going to help you to always stay fit and healthy. And how that benefits you in the future is because whenever you get older you wont have that many health problems or issues with your body so youll always stay fit. Whatll also help out a lot is by always eating healthy so thats something else you could do to help you accomplish and benefit your future. Also working is something you could always do thatll help you accomplish more in life. Why I say this is because if your always working then that means youll always have money. And having money would help you out in a lot of things. For example, it could help you out in school, for a car, food, clothes, and etc. Or you could also save up money for whenever you might need it for an emergency. Itll also benefit you by always having something to do so that way you wont just be home doing anything. So in conclusion, doing something is always going to help us accomplish more in life. I dont believe inactivity serves a purpose because you wont accomplish anything if your not doing something that benefits you. You always have to be active and doing something productive if not you wont be successful in life. That is why I say that you have to do something that benefits you so you could succeed in the future.

327,1109,7C4960DF5CB8,"I think that there should be a after school homework club because its hard to understand homework sometimes and you dont know what you are doing exactly but if we were to have these clubs think about how many students would get there work done . We might think that homework isnt important but it is homework is worth 10 percent of your grade and sure that might not be a lot but it could really help your grade. And it could really help you like when it comes to test you could know the matrial you need for this test if you did that one piece of homework that one piece of homework could have helped you past that test you probly failed or quiz . Also some students dont understand the work the teachers give like when you dont understand that class work you were doing in that class how do the teachers expect that the student bring in there homework . I hard for students to learn middle school student have a lot to do for example students have to worry about getting homework done for all 7 of these classes it isnt easy . Most teachers might give more than one piece of homework some might give 2 some might give 3 pieces of homework . Students could also ask about what they dont understand they will help students in what they dont understand or what they didnt understand in that lesson that they had .The teacher will explain what you didnt understand , some students just dont have time so maybe that one day that can stay afterschool could help them get all that students homework done . Also help them undestand not just give that student the answer to the question they would actually learn and that . This also will get students grades up and might take a B to and A . It will not only help the students but the school to because if these student are getting there homework done then that will make the school look better . Teacher will also know that students are getting there work done and not just getting the anwser like some students do now when it comes to homework . Other students that are cabelble of doing this work on there own but have a hard time turning the homework in on time and if the school had a afterschool club this it homework wouldnt be a problem . In conclusion this club would be really good to have because homework is a big issue in alot of these schools and most students dont care or dont understand how much homework matters it matters so much you probly wonder. Why you didnt pass this test or why couldnt pass this quiz you took maybe if you did that homework you could have past the test , quiz also home plays a big role in school teachers give studnets homework so we can get better at that subject it easier for students not to care about homework BECAUSE IT DOESNT MATTER but it does and. No matter how many time you try to tell yourself it doesnt matter it does and that is not going to change so do your homework and if this afterschool club happend then homework will be one less thing to worry about . I think that if the school had this club it would really help studnets in school and help really understand the work and homework and help them be less stress because it it alot of work for you to get done and espcially if you dont get the work you need to do . Also students would be happy that they got there homework done now they can do whatever they want afterschool becaus ewhat was taking up most of there afternoon is now done .",5,6,7,7,6,5,1637,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Getting advice from many people can help you get a different perspective, it can help you in the future,and it can help the community. Having a different perspective is really good . When you have a different perspective of something you might have a better adtuided . Lets say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. Having a different perspective can not only give the situation a better perspective but it can also give you a different perspective. Hear me out not only can other peoples perspective give the situation a different point of view but yourself as well. I believe that having advice from many people can really help you have a better perspective, adtuided,and understanding. Advice from more then one person can help your future. As you grow up you will release that you start to ask for more and more advice. I think the more you ask for advice the more you are most likely to be successful in your future. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. For example my teacher once told me that not understanding how to do something is okay because from that is how we learn from it. The advice given to you is something you will pass down . I think that its amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice can help you in the future by developing more and more,remembering it though your life,and pass it on to other generations. Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice. When advice is spread form person to person it spreads form community to community and then it spreads from state tot state and eventually the world. Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well Asking for opinions from more then one person can help you see different opinions,help you later in life, and help the world. Advice can help to see different points of view, help you in your ,and help our community become better.

In my opinion, Iam totally agreed to his wisdom of words by Wilson, Churchile, because there are many persons in general that could shows that the fauilures is part of success without loss of love to what we do.

330,1112,9B5E142C63AC,"My Talent A talent or skill is something that is unique about everyone. It takes time to develop a talent or a skill. A talent or skill basically is something you are good at doing. Many people have the ability to move their ears, but some dont. Most people like dancing and are good at it, so it is a talent. Around the world, many people have more than one talent. My talent is to sing and write music. Some people in the world havent found their talent yet. One way to develop talent is to try everything. If you try everything, youll eventually find something you are good at. During this process youll probably be trying different things you havent done before, like sky diving.

Soon, those activities might become a talent or skill. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way.

332,1114,22BF4720FB84,"for this issue, I think attending classes from home by way of online or video conferencing would not benefit.

And another is we can do activities that we get from some classes. First, friends form school is the reason that students cloud go to school because they will get a good relationship and that mean they have a socialite. If students attend classes from home they might get just a thing that teacher teach them but they will not get a teamwork when they have any work group form teacher. They will not know how to be a teamwork or working with another people. When they graduate for high and get into college or apply a job and they never used to have a social it will not work for them because they do not know about teamwork or how to live whit a group of people.

333,1115,A3E6A572C6E5,"Do you remember a time where whether it was your parents, teacher, or someone very close to you excepts you to be something that you are not? According to me, every parents wants their kids to be perfect, wonderful, and hard working. Every parents wants to see them successes in life, and be happy, but what they dont understand is how much pressure and anxiety they put on their child. I remember a time where i was under so much stress and pressure because my parents wanted me to be this perfect, wonderful, and hard working person just so i could be the best torture. Do you remember a time where you wanted to do something so bad, but everyone else wanted you to do something that you dont even like and want. I remember a very good friend of mine name Generic_Name, wanted to be an artiste, but every one in her family wanted her to be a doctor. We all know that being a doctor is not an easy job. sure you get high salary but being a doctor is not about getting high salary or wearing the white uniform is about carrying for others and enjoying your time with others . But Generic_Names family didnt understand that all they care about was her getting in medical school and be a doctor. Generic_Name is very smart, carrying, and wonderful person. because of her family pressure her to be a doctor she let her dream go and now is suffering very much, because she doesnt want to be a doctor she wants to be an artiste something that she wanted to do her whole lives. Thats why we should never pressure someone to be something that they are not. dreaming and working hard to be something that you always dreamed of is very hard when you have people, who constantly try to make something out of you that you know that you are not. One example of that is when i was little i always dreamed of becoming the greatest dancer at all time, but everyone was against what i wanted to do. i remember i had to set down and have word with my family i had to explain to them why i want to be what i want to be. I was under so much pressure, stress, and anxiety that i thought i was in a war with my own family. Everything i said or do they use it against me it was very sad, angry, depressed, and unhappy moments, but i get though it i did become a dancer, i did something that i thought i could never do, and i didnt let anyone to shut me down with their words or actions. The lesson that we could learn from my story is not to stand against your family and disrespected, them, but no to allow anyone to take your dream away from you. Always stay strong and never give up. ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" According to me every person in this world have the right to speak their mind and do whatever they wish or desire. No one should every try to make you something that you are not. In todays world we people try to make changes in others life by trying to make them something that they are not and thats where we lost loves one, friends and family just because we choice to do things we wanted insisted taking their advice and changing our path. We should be doing the thing we love and dreamed of no one has the right to tell you otherwise. You should never change yourself to make others happy or to show them you care about them, because if they really care about you they will accepted you for you. Changing yourself for other just so could show them your carrying, perfect, and happy is not love. Everyone has the right to be happy in their lives and we should accepted them they way they are. To give you an example of what i am talking about is i had a friend name Generic_Name he was very hard working guy who was loved by everyone in the community. Generic_Name was born in single family he was living with his mom and two younger brother. Generic_Names mom was a wonderful women who was loves by everyone. Generic_Name was the older child so he had a lot of responabilty he had to work to provide for his family, he had to go to school, and take care of his younger brothers. when Generic_Name get accepted to college he wanted to study biology but his mom wanted him study music but Generic_Name was never interested in music. he want to learn about living and nonliving things, but Generic_Names mom never agree with him she told him"" you have to study music and thats that."" Generic_Name was my best so when he told me about his problem i told him"" Listen Generic_Name i know you love your mom so much, but do what you love to do will make you happy and you dont have to be something that you are not interested in because you will suffer in the future"". Generic_Name loved his mom so much he didnt want to make her sad so we he went to college and he study music, but he never like what he was doing because he was born to be a biologist. The lesson to learn in this story is to never give up your dreams for your loved ones because once you started doing something there is no way back. In the future knowing that you did something for yourself and knowing that no matter what other said you did what you love to do is the greatest accomplishment that you could ever accomplish. Some say to be yourself is not the great accomplish but i disagree with that because being yourself, not losing hope, not giving up, and fighting with others trying not to be something that they are make you to be is the greatest accomplishment.

335,1117,28494A144B1A,"Character traits are what define a person. there are what make one person different the another. Although some people believe we choose our own character, nevertheless, our character are influences beyond our control because technology influences our traits and famous people can influences our traits and our parents influences our traits by they expectations. To begin, video game can influenced our traits. For example, my own experience say 3 year ago I start play video game, when I star play with my friends. We always say that when we grow up we like to do what they are doing because their life look good. Also, we start doing the same things as the game like dancing, and thinking same as the game, and acting like them. Our others friends who do not play the game they tell us, that we are change our traits because we are acting like them too. One day we released that game was influenced our character. Clearly, because we star thinking in the future our life same as the game, and that we can do our future as we see in the game easily. Furthermore, famous people influenced our traits. To continue with my experiences in things that I was influence, for example, when I was 12 year old. one day I was on YouTube, and I star see some videos about bloggers beauty, where they have a lot of makeup I do not use any makeup at the age, but when I see that they do their makeup, and look so beautiful I start doing my makeup, and think because I was wearing makeup I look good, one they my mom ask me, why I am wear makeup, if I told her that I do not like makeup, I just say because they do their makeup. Then, now that I am 19 year old, I released that I was doing things that I do not like because they are doing. clearly, this prove me that I was influences for a famous beauty. Finally, our parents influences our traits by they expectations. I will say something our parents want we do what they want. For example, we want to go out we are friends, and we ask our parents if we can go they say not, because they thing that our friend is a bad person. Also, they want to change our thought saying that bad thing about our friends, and finally they change are though about our friends. This show that, our parents can change our expectations about our friends. Clearly, parents always want we do what they want, and we always want they want because we do not them mad with us.

337,1119,20BC5CCE8C64,"""SNORE, SNORE"" every time that I do something I do not I feel so lazy. I think if we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that your mind do not get lazy and you feel productive. For example, if you go to school, have a job, and help other people. If you do many things every time later on you always will want to do something. I also know that you can do something without doing nothing and one them is been at of problems. Like Thomas Jefferson wrote,"" never to be idle"" that means that do not be the type of people that do not like to do nothing. First, I believe if you go to school you will accomplish more because your mind is going to be busy. In my opinion, I feel that I do a lot more than just not do nothing because: I wake up on time ,I go to school every day, I do my homewoks after school, and I feel productive by going to school. Also when I do not understand something I ask the teacher for help and if my classmate need my help I do my best by giving them information about the class. If I keep my mind busy I feel good because I experience talking with my classmate. Second, having a job help you by giving you experience for the future. For example, when I started working In my first job I learned a lot things like how to use a computer, I though that I was never going to learn it but I did it and now it help me for my education. Next, now I know that the way of accomplish something you need to have interest to do it. If you do not have interest or if you want to do nothing you never are going to accomplish anything because the best way of do it is by doing something. In my second job I did not know how to use a cellphone but I put all my interest to learned and help my customers by taking their orders. Now in my third job I know many things like : answer the phone, take orders, and especially how give a good customer service. Third, I think helping other people is way of accomplish something. If you help people like homeless you are going to have the opportunity to talk to them and understand why they do not have a place to live or a family to support them. I think this is the best way because some people prefer to leave their home because they do not like the rulers of their parents. This is not the best solution that people should take because everyone need a support of someone. And the best way of accomplish something no matter what it is is by obey and listen the old people who always have the right because they have more experience than us. For example, one day I was homeless because my parents left me with my two brothers and I did not have food to give to them every time that they asked for food my eyes were tearful because they were little and also they did not understand the situation. Now when I see people asking for food it remain me that one day I was like them. I chose to write about we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that you accomplish a lot of things by always doing something and I said by going to school, find a job, and helping other people. I believe t I also know that you can accomplish other things by doing something different but I chose help my self and others. Also I understand that you can accomplish something by doing nothing but one of then is by been at of problems. By doing all of this I considerate my self accomplishing many things.",7,6,7,5,6,6,434,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
338,1120,5C017EF0CF1E,"Its important to talk to a guidance and authorities expert when making a decision. People may say that making your own decision is good but others, say seeking guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters is better, because its helpful to hear other peoples advice and they are experienced. some people may argue that making your own decision is good because it makes a operson independent and people dont have to hear other peoples opinion. They have a point but how do they know they are making the right choice if they dont try talking to a guidance expert. Seeking guidance form experts and authorities about lifes important matters is important because its helpful to hear other peoples advice. For example if my friend Generic_Name had to make a life changing decision its important that she goes and talks to a guidance counselor. Also if she doesnt speak to a guidance expert and she makes a wrong choice who knows what could happen. It also makes room for less mistakes when you talk to others who are experts in guiding people.

339,1121,003885A45F42,"The best time in life is when you become yourself. I agree that the greatest accomplishment, is when you be yourself in a world that constantly trying to make you something else. Because you make your own choices, you become more happy, and you respect others. First, you make your own choices by being yourself. Becoming yourself means that you should be able to make your own choices and not be shy or afraid of what youre doing. Because youre defining yourself by doing those things that you want. Some people follow others, therefore, they dont make their own choices. People are afraid to make their own choice because they dont want to get rejected or be wrong. In this world, most of the teenagers act and follow the people who are strong and bullies. The reason they follow them and make the same choices they make, is because theyre afraid that they will get beaten up and be left out. Personally when I came to the United States I used to follow other, because I thought they were amazing. But one day, I knew I was walking in the wrong path and I left them. Making your own choices makes you happy because you get to do what you like and what you want to do. Its hard to make your own choices, but one day youre going to have to make your own choices. The more you mature the more it will become easier for you to not be afraid of what youre doing and how other people are looking at it, because at the end of the day Its your life and you do what you think is right. Second, You become more happy by being yourself because you make your own choices, You take responsibilities and you do whatever makes you happy. Also, some people act like theyre happy while not being themselves, but matter of fact, theyre depressed from the inside. Being yourself makes you more happy because you feel like you achieved something big. Also, Some religious kids who become themselves love everyone. In the bible it says ""Those who know God should love others, because God is love."" Not being yourself will get you depressed because you dont do everything you want to do, but you do what others wanna do because you want to fit in. Some kids who come from a different country will do stuff they dont want to do just to fit in, because they dont want to be lonely. Some people are afraid they wont be happy because they would lose a lot of friends for being themselves, but they have to know that those people should be there for them and support them for what hes doing since its his friends. Lastly, Respecting others will gain them to respect you. Some teenagers like to make fun of others, not listen to what they have to say, and they like to beat kids up. Also some kids dont like to not listen to their parents, and that is also disrespectful. The bible says "" Honor your father and mother."" If you respect your parents and listen to them, then they would trust you and not ask you lots of questions. Respecting other should be really important, because you dont want others to not respect you. Also, Some people are disrespectful because they were never respected. Important things to do to be respectful is, Listen to what the other person has to say, Stand up for them, Being friends with them Doing all of that will gain you respect and you would have good friends. Also, if you see someone bullying a kid dont watch, and stand up for them, dont be afraid to stand up for someone because youre doing the right thing. Some may disagree with me and say that its not that big of a deal, and it doesnt feel like a big accomplishment. But with all do respect, I agree that its a big accomplishment because nowadays its really hard to become yourself. In conclusion, Its hard to become yourself in this world, because others are holding that opportunity back from you and youre afraid to fight it back. Thats why I agree that to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment.

But inactivity also serve as a purpose because some people arent doing anything so they have time to finish and accomplish something because they are not doing anything The first reason that inactivity should serve as a purpose is because people that arent doing anything should be able to accomplish their work and other work so that they did not finish and they dont have an excuse to not do work. On the other hand people doing work have an excuse because if they are given a lot for work they might not have time to finish the other work but the people that finish working and have some time left should be given more work in till they done have anymore time at school or at work. The first reason why people accomplish something when they are doing something is because they work and dont waste time at school or work but sometime. The second reason is that they dont accomplish work when they are doing something because they wont have time to finish the other work or they rush ans make a lot of mistake on their work and will get a bad report are grade on it so thats why some people dont accomplish their work when they are doing other things.

341,1123,0E26C20CFBBE,Imagine being asked to teach a lesson but actually teaching it to elementary students. It would be a very helpful for the students that are struggling. I conquer with the person that is going to go and share the lesson. I am going to give you specific details and examples about the things I would do if I was he or she going to share the lesson with elementary students and why it should be important. One way that I agree by sharing a lesson to other students is important. This can be more helpful because the other teacher before that taught the students maybe didnt explain very well and the students were probably were confused the whole time or some of them were lackadaisical. And the new teacher that is going to teach the lesson to the students probably is a better explained and a probably has good and more skills. He or she maybe been called from many different schools and different states and asking if he or she can go teach a lesson to their students but if the teacher agrees with it. Another way I could be more helpful for the students by asking their teacher if I can see the whole students grades that are in the class and the people that are struggling and make a group lesson with them. The teacher should tell the students to write down notes when the teacher is writing them down too. The teacher should give the students homework and tell them to bring it back and check it and see if they have gotten better with the way the teacher is helping them more or not. The teacher should give a form to the students parents for the ones that are struggling and asking them permission if they want the teacher to help them more in what they are struggling more in. So the students can get their grade up and better in the SOLs. My last thing that I would do to be more specific and very useful is to give the students tests of the things they have been struggling with and see if they have gotten more better and see if the teacher has done a good job to the students. The teacher should give meetings to the student teachers and more lessons so they dont need to call for a better teacher than them. And its better if the teachers can get taught so they can be more specific in what the students asks them. All the teachers of the elementary should all go take lessons to teach better and get quizzed like their students. I explained why it is important to share a lesson to other students. Some of the students got better and some didnt but at least they tried and put effort in it. All my reasons should help why a teacher should share a lesson with other students. The students should be more grateful for the teacher that came and helped them out. These are all my examples I would do if I was the one sharing a lesson.,6,6,6,5,5,7,188,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
342,1124,9A93D940C694,"Is it true that some students at some point in their life want vacation time? Yes, because not everyone is a retard that wants to be studying and going to school all the time. Almost every student wants rest from homework. I think having a summer break for students is a good idea because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives them time to spend some time with their family and enjoy thier every minute of life. First of all, I think its a good idea to have summer break because it gives students some time to relax their brain and body. It gives students some free time to do what they want to do like trying new things out, playing new sports and finding what their real talents are, instead of doing school work and other activites all the time. Doing meditation is really good for your brain and mind, and its only done when you have time for it and nothing to distract you. Secondly, I think its a good idea to have summer break for students because it gives them time to spend some time with their family. Some of us are really bad at giving our parents time in life because its just too much to do everyday. Half of students day they spend in school and get no extra time for their parents. Spending time with parents is not wasting time when your really enoying it and its a good time spend. On the other hand, some people might argue that its not a good idea for students to have summer break because they will waste their time by being home all day or texting their friends. It will kill their education time and wont give them enought time to get to where they want to be in future. In conclution, I think its a good idea for students to have summer break because it gives them the opportunity to go new places they never been to and try out new dishes they never tasted. I think life is too short to be doing homework and studying for tests, and planning for your future. Life is about having some fun time and enjoying every little moment with your family and friends instead of focused on one thing all day and everyday which is school.

Doing something productive keep your body and mind working, and as we know exercise help us to avoid many kinds of diseases, and perhaps raising our lifetime. Its like my grandfather told me someday in the past..."" if I stop to work, Ill die,because, work help me to forget all my bad situations in my life even my diseases, and instead of that I always thinking... what would be my next task to accomplish ?"".

First, people should create their own ideas. although, they have to follow their instincts, and dont led anybody disturb their mind. Think on how they want to improve and try new things. Also seeking ideas from other people is not a very good thing when it wont benefit them. To understand what the role of life is, people should expand their ideas And work out more by themselves. Second, people should make good decisions. In other words, people should decide what they really want. When people make good decisions they tend to be successful and encourage themselves to keep growing. Decide what people really want, and what can they really do, is very important, since not everyone is able to do what other people can do. Therefore, confidence is the key to make good decisions. We can also say that people need time to think about any bad consequenses that can result from any of their decisions. Third, people will get more experince. In fact, people know more about life when their experience is greater. Experience will help people to know how to face problems whenever they make a mistake.

347,1129,39524C93F4D4,"People will tell you that without doing something, youll never get what you want. I agree. Accomplishing something is a great feeling when you know youve done it because when you know you put in the time and effort for it and get a great result. It shows that the time you toke to make it was worth it. Sitting around, letting people hand you stuff will get you no where in life, because instead of you doing something, you wait for them to give it to you, not aware of what that person had to do to. What does it mean to accomplish something? To me accomplishing something is when you worked hard for what you did and youre satisfied with your result. That to me is accomplishing something. Whenever I set my mind to anything, I do whatever it takes to make it. For example, I had a championship finals in a week and I needed time to prepare my mind and body for the game. The time came to play the game and all I could think about was winning that trophy. We ended up winning, and I won what I was waiting to accomplish. I dont think I could have made it if I didnt make an dedicate my time to win the finals. Kids nowadays are spoiled by there parents to get whatever they want just by asking. I can understand that some parents care about what the needs of there own children, but I often see parents buy usless things for there kids and that can be a problem because when they know they can get these things that arent any use for them, they go asking for other stuff that they dont need. A solution to this problem can be when they are old enough to get a job, to get one so they can make money, so they can buy things for them selves. Instead of leaching on Mommy and Daddys money all the time. Getting a job shows that youre doing something to get what you want, for example, a house, a car, anything you can spend youre own money that you need. The effort you showed got to where you are and now you know you accomplished it. A person I know that has accomplished alot in his life is Cristiano Ronaldo. He is a soccer athlete and was born in a small town in Portugal. Like others there, his family was really poor and couldnt afford him anything really. He was a trouble child in school and misbehaved when things didnt go his way. He was very talented in soccer though. He would go outside, find anything round and did whatever he would do to a real soccer ball. He was noticed by coaches when they would here a young kid scoring goals not any normal kid would. He moved to the capital of Portugal and would play for the towns Division one team. He never forgot his family back home. He would have made a ton of money to send back to his family and bought them a house in a much nicer and safer location. His goal was to be the best player in all of soccer. He worked in and out of practices to get better and play for a club that people would notice that he was. He was bought by one of the greatest teams in all of europe Real Madrid. He was the most highest paid athlete at the time and whenever he got his pay check, he would always use it for a good cause like, family, charity, etc. He would eventually be nominated for the best player award five times and would end up winning those times. He accomplished what he had dreamt of becoming, and I hope people could see his story and realize you cant just sit around and do nothing, you have to put in time and effort to get what you want. I can understand when people can get lazy and not do anything to accomplish anything. Not everyone is perfect. But sooner or later theyll realize that without doing something, you cant get what you want. Sometimes people are fortunate to recieve things just by asking, but do you want to live a life leaching off people? Letting them know ""oh this person cant live without me because I get him everything"" I know I wouldnt. I hope to accomplish here that, you have to make an effort in order to accomplish something.

This change is a good idea, Iam certain this action was taken to awareness as students to eat healthier also to build a efficient body .

First reason, is students can choose the classes they need , so they can have more oportunity to choose the classes they need for get the diploma, they can choose the classes for get more credit, this is a good idea students can choose a electives classes so tehy can talk with the teachers to choose classes tehy need to graduated. Many others students do not like music or drama claases, students have oportunity if they can choose electives classes so they can have few classes, they can have more time after school if they have a job.

356,1138,8C5BF0347F87,"People around the world have thought about the way students should be teach or the way they should be treated but a few have notice that many students are struggling to build self-esteem. Students have difficulties and they affront them without their parents help. Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising students deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students. According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably wont help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote. However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friends brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life. Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever. In addition, praising students deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year. In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the students best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements, Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work.

Students are already stressed out because of school work, letting a student use their phone as a learning tool would only benefit them in finishing their work on time. This is why teachers should let students utilize their phones as a learning tool and not be against the usage of it when doing school work. Admittedly, students could get distracted with their phones and not get their work done in time. However, Teachers can specify that the use of phones is only for academic use only during classroom hours. That anybody who is not abiding by the rules will automatically get ISS. Therefore, students would understand that it is a serious matter and would not be playing around with their phones and getting distracted. Furthermore, students would not have to wait on the schools slow internet and wifi to finish their classwork on time. Students phones work faster than most of the computers in school and they would be able to finish their work faster. For example at the beginning of the school year at SCHOOL_NAME the wifi and internet were down almost every day. Making everybody in the school that has online classes or just courses that require the use of the internet to be behind in all of their work. Also, schools computers are outdated and full of past information that makes the computers work at a much slower pace than a phone would. This is a contributing factor to students not being able to finish their work because the computers are outdated, it takes most of them at least twenty minutes to log in. Those are minutes lost that a student could have been using to have started their class work and possibly even finish it. Consequently, if phones were allowed to be used for class work then students would be able to finish their work on time and not have to worry is the wifi is working or if the computer is taking too long to log on. In addition, students could take their work home if they are not done with it, and they would not have to worry about being behind on their class work. Students most of the time do not have enough time during class to finish all of their class work. Making their work pile up high and since the school does not let students take computers home they could not take their work home with them. If students have class work on a specific computer app like Microsoft word they would not be able to access it from a computer at their house because they do not have the same system we have in school. For example, one of the classes that I take is econ and personal finance and a lot, if not most of the class is online. If we have to do a vocabulary in Microsoft word I have no way of accessing that document until the next day and by then we would have something completely different to do. Letting students use their phones to do work like in Microsoft word would mean that students could use their phones to type up their paper in Google classroom and send it in or leave it in the drop box in desire to learn. Hence, why letting students utilize their phones would be a great benefit to them. In conclusion, letting students utilize their devices as a learning tool or experience would be easier on them. If students are permitted to utilize their phones in the class room then they would not have to worry about not finishing their work during class. This is why students should sign a petition and turn it in to the principal, so the use of cell phones during class work can be permitted and not be frowned upon.",9,7,8,8,9,8,983,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

362,1144,C3429FEF8AEE,"I recently learned that some educators feel like the summer break is to long and that the students do not retain information as easily when they return to fall some people argue that there should be year-round schools. where there would be 3-4 week break in the summer a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. In my opinion summer vacation should remain longer. I truly believe that a longer summer vacation can be beneficial for those students that want to work and save money when winter comes. One reason why summer vacation should be remain long is that when school ends some students choose to work on summer vacation to save as much money as they can, so they can stay in their house when winter comes. If they have only 3-4 week of break they will not be able to save money when winter comes. Having to work during winter is difficult for those students that do not like winter. In instance when I started to work I did not like to work in winter days. In my country the weather it is hot and I am adapted to my countrys weather not to cold weather. Another reason is that when winter comes and it snows sometimes the roads are too slippery some students drive during the snow days if they work during winter season they might have an accident due to the weather. If they work during the summer they will nothave to work during winter days. However, some students will argue that is better a shorter summer break than a longer break, a longer summer break can be helpful to do a lot of things such as, work or relax.

Because the majority of people might be mad when from somthing when we see them from the first time, I disagree with this statement because most people chang there impressions when theyre in a spicific mood, Some might change after a proplem has been solved. Because when I was yonger from now my dad allways use too tell me ""too mach agreement kills a chat"". Many peple chang thier imperssions after the first time we see them. So I have a frined who allways chang her mood by any time, some times she would come to my house and knock on the door even if we were just argued about something, but when I saw her the first time when we met she was very nice and my parent invited her to my house and her first time her impression was very happy and intersted to see us and learen about our culture, so when I saw her the next day we were so happy that we met. and I told her my trip how we came to the US, she was so impress to know more about us, But some time she woluld change becaus of her parents and when shes sad she comes to my house and tell me how she has been and how her family is with her, and I was listen to her as she tells me every thing, But when some one come to our house and sees her like that they say that shes wired from how she acts, but her first imression wast like that, she changes with what impact throw her life, and were a teens also, Every day my parents sees her they say that shes very talented because she has a very good voice and I use to be so happy to see her singing because she had a good voice, but her impreesion changed after I saw her how she reacts with others, and I use to get surprised of how shes diffeent with methen others, but now I found that people are like a door each person need a spacial key to open them and understand how they feel and think. To see peoples impression, I have to look at them when they are in thier good time that will chang the ideas. and to affect especially forcibly or deeply to some ones mind when they see some one impressions for the first time. I encorage everyone to change thier opinion about the first impression are almost impossible to change. Because the majority of people impression can chang etheir over time or by the area sourounding them, and figer out how make time to understand how it goes and how people thier features from influence by the socity around us and how I said can give the impress with your senserity follow peoples impressions, and literally the word impression is the sence of feeling in how someones feeling from sirten situation. Seeing the reality, Most humans have their way of reactions to react to every thing they can show or chang by somehow in their life, In this period of time no one like to listen to someones story, Real people who shows their impressions by the area sourounding them it effects us as who we are and the time that we are in, So the place that we are often been can effect our impressions, The place that we been raised in can impact on our impression. Peoples reactions might chang after an accident happen to some ones in the past It can be a very big and huge chang for some ones reactions if we see them the next time or day. Places and moumints can be on of the reasons why people impressions are mostly can change by this way, This kind of things might be wired to be impossible. Emotions and there behavioral changes in some bodeis deppend on how they think by a word or emotinal apperance can be changed with their behavioras, and some might be in need so bad for somthing and that can also shows their impressions behavioral chang.

Like they want to take gym or something like this but i know that some boys would not like this idea . If some kids do enjoy painting or acting . but some kids do not like acting or painting . They might think that its boring for them to be in that class . I know that some kids like to act cool and be rude to teachers that they dont like the class or something like this . Thats why im saying that arts classes should not be required to take . I think the best thing to do is to allow kids to pick their classes that they want to take as an elective class . its really the best thing to do in my thinking . Because look at it like this if kids that dont like drama and they dont let the teachers teach because they do not wanna be there . they want be in another class that they really want to be . thats another thing that teachers have to go though dealing with rude kids . This concludes my argument about students having to take arts classes . this is for all schools please let your kids to pick their classes . or at least give them one class that they like . like i said at first i really dont like this argument thats happening . ,5,6,7,6,6,6,1638,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

366,1148,7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In todays societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them. Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, its dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, its interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore. Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesnt mean its healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesnt have any and stays at home playing video games. Thats why some parents disagree with todays societies. The reason why is because, they dont like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future. However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion. Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact its maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed. It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career. As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about. Those were my .",8,8,8,9,7,8,1683,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

I think they should add one and a half hour to school each day because than class would be more longer, we would have to do more homework, and some students have things to do after school everyday. I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because class would be more longer. If schools board add one and a half hour to school each day every class would be more longer. For example my civics class is two hours if they add one and a half hour than my civics class would be two and a half hour. If class was longer teachers would have to work more. They would have to work more because than they have to make more projects and grade more papers that each student turns in. Students would have to work harder then what they usually do because they would get more work because the class is longer. Secondly I disagree because if school board adds one and a half hour to school each day then we would get more homework. students would have to do more homework since class is longer that would get more projects and some students dont get to finish their work in class so they have to do it for homework. They would get in trouble if they dont finish their homework. some students dont get to finish their homework because they have to do more work for another class. Lastly, I disagree that the school board should add one and a half hour to school each day because when students get out of class they have to do things or go somewhere. Students have to take care of their siblings. Some students when they get out school have to take care of their brothers and sisters because their parents have to go somewhere or they have to do some work. Some kids practice sports in the afternoon for example soccer, basketball , etc. When I get out of school I have to go to soccer practice at 4:30 pm ,so before going to practice I have to do my homework and sometimes I dont get to finish then until I come back from practice. Sometimes I do get in trouble with my teachers because I didnt finish my homework. Some students have to go visit their family because maybe that are going to a party that they are making or they are sick and you have to go see how they are. Sometimes my mom waits for me until I get out of school to go visit our family. Some of then have to clean their room, wash the dishes, and take the trash out.

368,1150,E2F767441B44,"If in high school should young students be capable of committing to a career. Some adults say that young students should pick a career. Others say that they are not ready to choose and commit to a career. I believe that students should commit to a career at a young age. The age shouldnt determined how committed you can be to a career. Being young shows a lot of both positive and negative benefits. Early experience for these students can benefit future jobs. For example, you take a class for cooking and seek for a job you will have a better chance then those who have no experience. Starting your career with prior knowledge before becoming an adult will make it easier to obtain a job once you graduate high school. Those who choose to wait after high school will have a harder time seeking a job. Your chances for a job are much higher then those without any experience. Making less mistakes because of all the prior knowledge you learned beforehand. For example, you take a class for cooking and you start learning early how to stop from burning your food. So, when you start cooking at a restaurant you will know how to stop from ruining the food. Starting young will prevent less mistakes from happening in your future job. This gives the students a better resume if they know what they are capable of doing and doesnt need to be taught. Having less mistakes during the job will show your bosses that you know what you are doing for them. The students will have some confidence before going into their career. For example, you learn about the kitchen and what everything does so when you go in you wont expect anything new. This will help students have some confidence since they know what to expect going into theyre career. Before entering a career its good that students can relax and feel better since they know how everything will go. A boost of confidence is what students need before going into something. On the other hand, people say that having students commit to career in high school is a bad idea. For example, students are constantly changing there mind and changing there interests. Some adults say they are to young to commit to a career because of how uncertain they are when they make decisions. So, they think how can a student choose something for the rest of there life if they cant decide on some of the most simplest decisions. Those adults think that students should wait until they are older to make that type of decision. Having students start early come with so many benefits for there future. They get to learn more in advance then the rest. Also they have better oppurtunites and better chances with getting there perfered career. That many positive outcomes will come out of starting early. So, I believe that students can commit to a career at a young age in high school. ",10,8,8,8,6,8,3263,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

370,1152,7203112033A1,"Hello my name is Generic_Name and I am here to tell you why I think, distance learning is a good idea, rather then a bad idea. I will be giving you three diffrent points of view, and why it wouldnt be a bad idea for some of us. My first opinion on distance learning would be, maybe he or she gets bullied for the classes they take and dont want to be in school no more. My second opinion would be if your not in school range and your parents cant drive you to school on time, then you could easily stay home, pull out your phone, computer, or tablet and do you work on it. My third opinion would be why not try it you know maybe youll like it. 1 OPINION: Everyone one knows school is very hard for everyone, nowadays school is based off of how you dress, or the way you walk, or just in general who you are. I used to get bullied in school a lot but ever since I switched to online school Ive never felt better I get all my work done, the teachers are so nice to me, there very patient and polite, and I dont have to put up with nobodys crap from school. It was a good switch for me, and itll be a good switch for you too! 2 OPINION: Every where you live there is always one problem, school range. I know its hard for everyone to find a ride to school or maybe it isnt, but say one day you move and u cant find a ride to school the next week and you dont have a ride cause your parents cant take you cause theyre running late for work, or you just missed the bus and your house is to far from the school. Well thats why youve been given the option for online school. Would you take it ? I would because iw ouldnt have to stress on trying to get up on time, and trying on clothes for school, or finding something to eat all in a rush. I love online school cause i can get up at whatever time i want to. I wouldnt ave to make my parents late for work every now and then. Also you can start your assignments on your time, say like your not busy u can start it then but you have to do them because there are new assignments everyday. So think about it for a minute and see why it might be a good option for you. 3 OPINION: Why not just try it. I think you guys or girls, or whatever should give it a try because not everyone has the privilege to have sort of secondary learning challenge I think that if your try it just like I did. The price for online school is around from 150-200 dollars, I know it might sound a little exspensive but its worth every penny you spend. So dont hesitate to try it youll love it. In conclusion I think it is a good thing to do distance school because it gives you benefits youve never gotten before and it might turn out to be the best decision you ever made in your son, or daughter life. So dont hesitate to call, call right now if you can I love it and they will to.",7,7,7,7,7,8,1475,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
371,1153,C2E3AD707EDC,"I have the idea that our school should adoptep this model that consist in extending the school day two hours. This model come from a system of some businesses have adopted to conserve energy and resources, this model can help student get more involvev in their apprenticesship and schools activities. This idea can help stueden but it have disadvantages is well, because there will be some students that will take a lot of time to be in the habit because they were accustomed to the normal school day. Also some students have to work after school, this meas if they stay at the school more time, it will less time that they will have to make works hours, but this dosent affect them to much, because they will attend to the school only four day in a week. This is graet because they will have a long weeked to make their tasks and work and help their parents at home with the homes jod. One reasons why our school should follow this model is the creations of new classes like: workshop , drama, and stodios of art . Student can be involvev in every kind of activity to spend their time in something that will help them in their future. Everyone can join up to any program at the school like ORTC this is a great program for some student that are thinking about join up to some militars branchs, as we know the military can give you many benefits really good, with this program they will get a rich knowledge about it. Many peoples will disagree with this new model of extending the school day two hours because some of them dosent like the school already. Also some parents can be disagree because they think that the students doesnt need that much time at the school thats why the school should make a specific schedule, addding more breaks and activities and then, they will realize that this model of extending the school day two hour will be good, and then student will take advantage of time that they will have to learn more. In example we have a groups of society as we know like some businesses have adopted a four day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours to conserve energy and resources. That way the worker have a extra day that can be spend with another work and they are available to have a second jod. This can help them get a better financial life or take that extra time to esped it with their families.

Although some say that success shouldnt be consist of failure because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner, actually failure plays in the pursuit of success because people fail, but they learn from their mistakes and its positively affects people personalty. Those who believes success shouldnt be consist of failure have their reason. Some say failure may negatively affects people in their life. But, success makes people feel proud and enthusiasm. Because a failure makes you a loser, not a winner. Failure helps people to find their a path to success. People fail, but they can learn from their mistakes. For example, I took math test last week, and I didnt do well on the test. My score was 50 out of 100. So, I checked my test paper, and I saw what mistakes I got and learned from it. Then, I retook the test, and I got 91 out of 100, I was proud; after, I saw my score. I know many people hate failing, they think its negatively affects their life. But, failing is sometimes theres benefits because its positively affects people personality. Such as, hard working, proud, and encourage. First, people have their dreams, some wants to be a football player, or some wants to be a president. They need to work hard to accomplish their dreams. Some people fail or success, but they are working hard to accomplish their dreams. Lastly, pride and encouragement.

He cares about his relative cheering for him. Conclusion, Failure plays in the pursuit of success. I believe failure helps people to find their a path to success.

373,1155,5C764A810680,"Do you want your child home school to adopt the four-day school week and extend the schools hours? I do not agree with schools extending the schools hours nor adopting a four-day week. Some students have just do not like what they are doing in class or do not get the chapter, so they get others students to do it for them. They can get a lot of homework, so if they extend the school day they are going to have more homework than usual and be tired. Students can get home late and cannot spend time with their families, if they have a lot of homework. Within four-day school week students can get stressed out worst than usual. The way that parent can react for adding more hours. First, some people act like they do not know what they are doing, just because they are lazy. In my opinion, some students like others students to do their work and that is not fair for the other student. Allowing to extend the schools hours is going to mess people schedule or their parents work schedule. Some parents get out of work early and they got time to pick their child up, if we extend the schools hours that could really mess them up. Students are so much smarter if they focus on what they want. I believe that once you put your mind to it, you will get it. Next, parents do not like their child to get home so tired. Some parents like to know how was their day or how their grades look like, but if a student is tired all the time how she or he suppose to have good grades? Sleep is one of the most important things that a human being needs. A human cannot go long without sleep. Parents like to see their child happy, with energy, and doing things that she or he likes If students do not have the sleep they need to have, that is going to mess with his or her grades. School is hard itself and I do not think adding more hours is going to be helpful. Finally, getting home late and stressing out are one of the worst things ever. Stress can lead you to have some type of illness in the future. What some people do to release stress is that they get a day to themselves and go to a spa or shopping. Other people get things done first and they would like to shopping or to do something they like such as going to the movies, play video games, and play any sport. Students get a lot of homework in a week, imagine in a four-day week. People should really think first what they are going to do and get it done. Some people just like taking everything as a joke and that is not good, but that is on them. In my opinion just do it, just get it done and get it over with. Some people just get lazy but they still get it done. No matter whats on your way, you can always get things done. When getting home late from school or any activity all you want to so is rest. Some people go to sleep knowing that they have homework or a test the very next day, if they did not study or got their homework done, they might have a zero or both things. That is why I think it is important to study and not to adopt the four-day school week. In conclusion, conserving energy and resources has a lot of benefits, but I do not agree with adding hours to school. Students have it so much harder now days that I think extending the school day is going to be even worst. Some disadvantages are people get stress easily, they will have a lot of homework, and finally they can get home late especially if they have to stay after school. Honestly people who agree on this have their good or bad reasons, but these are my reason why we should agree to extend the schools hours nor adopting the four-day school week. However, just do whats have to be done for you to accomplish your dream. If they add more hours to the school or not, do not worry just focus on you.",7,5,6,5,7,7,1195,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

Another reason why students should not be allowed to do the 3 year program is because its going to be stressful trying to put a 4 year education in 3 years. Some students take advance courses that are more chalaging, and give out more homework then regular classes. some students are not going to be available after school because they may have to stay after school to retake important quizzes or test that are going to affect a big part of there grade. A student may have to go home and work on big projects or homework so there ability to stay after school is going to be limited due to the fact that they have homework to do and other assignment. One other major reason is that the student with be involved in extra curricular activity such ass sports some sports can be year around sports so even is not there season they still have to condition and train for the upcoming season so they are most likely going to have to stay after school hours to do those things. another reason is that they might be involved in clubs so they also have to stay after school and also have to do some type of volunteering in the community so thats going to take away time so they may not be away available to attend to all the required classes to be able to graduate using the 3 year program. another reason is that they might have tutoring either at home or in school so they are able to get help on homework and other material that they need help with projects and stuff like that. My conclusion is that no students should not be alowd to graduate early using the 3 year program, became is going to add on to things that the students already have going on in there lives so i believe student should just graduate with there class and take there time and graduate high school in 4 years.

376,1158,41DF6D292056,"In this essay we are going to discuss the various issues related to working in a group and working indvidually. The idea here will be to study the pros and cons with ralation to the particular indvidual and not to the group of which she is a part. First we will try to understand the dynamics of a group vis a vis individual, then understand the various issues involved in working as a part of the group. We would also see as to how those issuse will be influencing the person, be it in the positive side or being a hindrance. Remamber last time when you had to do your project. You must have contemplated doing it by many ways. But some thing that comes to mind very in the beginning is either individually or in a group. Every body by facto knows what it is to be individual and perform a task individually, as she is the only person who is doing the task. But what is group and how it is formed and what are the dynamics involved in it. So what is a group, we may dedine it as a collection of several people who come togethor to do a particular task or goal. And the group form, their structure and process and also deals with how it is functioning. This aspect of group dynamics is relevant in formal and informal groups of all types. In any organisational entity groups are very common entity and hence their study and group dynamics is an important area in the study of oranisational behaviour. Being with group dynamics let us see what exactly it is about, it basically deals with why and how groups are formed and developed. In order to explain the same many theories have been proposed. While group work has a host of merits, it also has its flip sids. Firstly, individual students usually lack the power to control the task as compared to when the work is assigned to one person for completion. Additionally, some group members tend to dominate in terms of contributions while othors may become dormant. In this case, the group may achieve its goal but limit other students. Work well together can achieve much more than indvividuals working on their own. A broader range of skills can be applied to practical activities and sharing and discussing ideas can play a pivotal role in deepening your understanding of a particual subject area. Being part of a team will help you develop your own interpersonal skills such as speaking and listening as well as team working skills suck as leadership, and working wirth motivating others. Some of these skills will be useful throughout your academic career and all are value. In order to maximise these benefits, you will need to manage your group work effectively.",8,8,10,9,9,8,858,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
377,1159,6D6E937C3A67,"We do not choose our own character, if everyone gets to choose their own character nobody will have any bad people in this world, everyone would be full of good things because they will be able to pick their characteristics. If everyone had the same characteristics life would not be as good as it is now. Each person has different characteristics based on their culture, environment, childhood makes difference in their character. These are the three main reasons that differentiate peoples characters, and makes them good in their own way. Each person has had a different childhood which is an important part of peoples characters. Childhood is very important because it is the the base of the building this is where person starts building their knowledge. Childhoods can effect kids when they grow up in a lot of different ways. A lot of teachers in the middle east hit their students when they do not do homework or get a bad grade on a test, this makes the students not wanting to go to school and hating school because they get hit in front of their friends, this does not give students enough confidence which is going to effect their characters in the future. Children who spend hours and hours on video game and making online friends, this make them anti-social people when they get older. Peoples environment such as work place, friends has a lot of effects on their characters. If a person has a lot of bad friends that persons character is not gonna be the same as a person who hangs around with good friends, for example if a guy has friends who do drugs even if does not do them step by step they are going to get him to do it and that will start making changes in his character, on the other hand if a person has good friends who tell him lets go to the library to read or study that will have a positive effect on that person,s character. In work if a person is working and his manager yells at him that will lower his self confidence and have a negative impact on his character. Culture has a big impact on a persons character in a lot of different ways. Culture is what is going on around the person and what he believes in or does not believe in. Sometimes cultures effect the persons character in good ways sometimes in bad ways. Culture makes people religious, pray and be good people. Sometimes culture does not give the person the freedom they need for example, in the middle east sex before marriage is not allowed which makes a lot of difference in peoples characters making them do secret stuff and not being able to communicate with the other gender because they are not even allowed to talk to each other because of culture. In conclusion people do not get to choose their character. Peoples character is formed by a lot of different things such as environment, culture and childhood these are the most important to form a persons character. At the end of the day all characters are good in their own way, the difference between people is what makes them stand out and complete each other. This is a very important topic and it means a lot to me and other people Thank You for giving me the change to talk about it.

Finish the high school in three year is a big bad idea because is to short to finish the high school, and another parts some students dont wants to go more to the school so they choose that new program for a short year to graduate in high school. The other parts is not for all High schools to finish in three year, so is most better to delete that program and cancel about to finish the high school in three year and the students who follow that program they need to take the normal high school. To change the new program for all high school of the country is not easy, because some schools dont agree to doing that so is most better to continue the traditional four years. If they change that program for all schools of the country they have a big responsibility about that, because most of High Schools they have a big problem and work for example to change like that credit for graduate to the high school, the SOL text so is not a very good idea to doing that. The conclusion, this is the best option, is to follow the rules of the schools. One should not make a big problem with the laws and the constitution of the schools.

380,1162,85F4C57672EA,"""Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home""? I do not believe that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. I believe the students can get distracted so easily at home. For example, you start watching a movie; when you were supposed to your homework. That would affect your grade because you didnt do it on time. Another, example is when your mom tell you to buy something and then you forgot what were you doing. In addition, time is another reason why is not beneficial taking classes from home. Time is one of the consequences attend to classes online is not beneficial because unexpected things can happen. You cant control time. For example, someone in your family die or they have a car crash or even work schedule. Those examples can affect you by reducing the time and material you were to work on. Thats why you cant predict what is unexpected. Unexpected times take away your energy, concentration and comprehension on what your studying. Another, reason why classes from home isnt good. Energy keep you awake. Being concentrate shows interest on what you doing and comprehension is how much you understand. If youre sleepy you cannot do any of that. However, I want to focus more in the comprehension part. Never ever compare a teacher vs a computer. For example, you didnt understand the new unit because is confusing, you can always put your hand up and ask the teacher. The teacher will explain at their best for you to comprehend. On the contrary, you cant do it because youre at home and nobody can explain the material you dont understand. Some students agree they can benefit from being able to attend classes from home because they can do it later, if they miss something on class. Also, they can study anywhere they can have access to it. That reject to be in certain place. Youre free to study and work without any restrain. All you need is to manage your time. You be able to kill two birds on the same shot. To conclude, students will realize that a teacher is way better than a computer. The teachers study the materials on what they gonna teach and they graduate from college, gain a diploma of what they teaching you. They have the proof and I believe they are doing the right choices about giving you materials for you on the future. Thats why i would never change them for one computer at home.

People is really suseptible, specially kids, so lets try to keep those bad influnces on them, because as the same way a great person can come from a bad place, a bad person can also come from a rich place just because they were under some bad influence, teach them good things so they can avoid the bad ones.

When we choose the character that we want, it helps us to find the right people in our life, because we are more happy when we find people that are the same as our character without changing our character. You can not pretend to be the character that you do not choose to be, that is just like living a fake life. Life is easier and happier when we follow our own rules. Lets follow our character that we choose to be, no matter what!!. ",7,6,7,6,6,5,1444,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Working in a group is so much beneficial because within a group your able to get your work done quicker and efficient. ""who doesnt want that? I know I do"". With a group you can also interact and descuse with your peers about your work and get feed back. Weather or not you agree or disagree with this position. One good thing about working alone is that there are no group distractions. Example you might have that one person in your group that does nothing and just fools around the whole time. Never... One of the benefits in working in a group is being able to get your work done quicker rather than working by yourself. For example what if you have an SA due in a week and a slideshow to go with it? But you had a choice to to work by yourself or within a group,I wouldnt think twice about it, I would go with a group"". Also In groups you can discuse and interact with your peers. Groups can also help one another and give eachother feed back depending on what your working one. Another benefit working within a group is being able to have multiple ideas, thoughts rather than just you having to think and work on everything by yourself. This is the best thing there is to working in a group is that all of you have ideas weather there the same or diffrent,groups can combine eachothers thoughts and ideas to make somthing incredible. Weather its working in a group project at school or your partisipating in a high end business group its all set to say that working in a group is way benificial than working alone.

393,1175,C1BED9EF3630,"Most high school students prefer to do their regular four years of high school and enter college after they graduate and apply for college during their senior year to get help from their counselors and school teachers. Graduate early could be difficult for adolescents because not everyone have the same way of learning and some can be more faster than others. School districts should let the students decide whether they want to graduate early or not and give them more freedom to do want they want about their future. students that do their traditional four years do not follow this plan because it can bring pressure and anxiety, they would have to do extra work and, they are able to pick elective classes. Every student know that it is very important to pass their classes and be aware of how many credits they have in order to graduate. If you want to graduate early this issue can be dangerous because it can bring anxiety and pressure to adolescents during their high school years. Graduate early can make your life difficult because anxiety combine with pressure frequently gives mental problems. Some parents are constantly checking grades and that can be very frustrated towards their kids and hard to handle because they are often being told to do well and if they dont their guardians limit important items from them and usually control their life because they dont get good grades. The fear to be behind and getting low grades are always present in students but the worries should be less for those that do not graduate early. teachers recommend to the students to take extra courses during the summer or evenings to advanced in their classes. on account of doing four years of high school you dont need to do extra work. In spite of that you still need to do your assignments at the same time but being not in a rush like the others. Every person should be responsible for their own work even if they have to do it later on it doesnt matter. The school provides the students the opportunity to take a new subject that they havent took before. by given them the chance to every student to choose elective courses unfortunately for those that graduate early dont have the same option because it is a waste of time receiving a class you dont need; otherwise you can take take as many as you want to challenge yourself and become better at any new topic you want to learn. In conclusion it is a better idea if students do their traditional four years of high school. In case they need help from their teachers and schools they can get support from both. Anxiety and pressure are serious problems that any student have to pass through because it distract them from their learning and the attention of the students is also taken away. Extra time should not be used to do extra work because the kids need have to do their assignments and barely have time to do extra courses. Everyone should have elective classes because is a good way to learn new activities in school and get distracted from your most important classes that you are taking during the school year.

394,1176,AA0CD6D22CA3,"Identify a Career Before High School Have you ever heard about those societies that expect students to identify a career before getting into high school? Last week I was reeding the newspaper and there was a special new that really got my attention. The new was talking about a new society which wants all students to idenfy a career before they get in high school. Because some students think is not necessary, there is a big debate going on. I believe that is good to implant to students the idea to commit to a career before getting into high school because then when they start high school they will choose the necessary classes which will help them to earn knowledge of this career. Another reason is that they will not be getting distracted later on thinking about what career should they select. If the students choose a career before getting into high school, they will get mature and they will be prepared to be more formal and follow the steps to graduate on time and then start working on the few steps that they will have for achieving completely their dreamed career. I believe that if studdents choose their career before starting high school it will be easier for them in the future. I have a niece that is in 8th grade in middle school, she is almost about to start high school. My niece was telling me the other day that she loves medicine, and she would love to become a doctor. She told me that she asked to her counselor for some classes recomendations. Her counselor recommended to her a medicines academy and also some extra science and health classes. Now she is excited to start high school. If students decide what career are they interested on before getting into high school will help them to clear their mind. Once they get the opportunity to choose their classes schudele for high school they will have in ind that they should pick classes that are related to the career that they want to achieve. When I was in high school I did not even know what a career was, because the teachers in middle school nor my parents never mentioned it. When I was going to start high school I remember that the summer after starting high school, all the future new niners were called to a meeting. In this meeting we were supposed to choose our new classes for our first year in high school. They gave us all a really big list of classes from where we could choose, and because I did no know anything, and I had not any plans for my future, I chose the same classes that my other friend was choosing. When I was in my Senior year the questions started ""so what is your plan after graduating?"" ""what is your dreamed career?"" I was completely lost, so I went to talk to my counselor and she explained me what a career was. I said I wanted to be periodist, and then I realized that I wasted my opportunities of earning knowledge and practice during my first high school years. I could have been in leadership class and learn how to talk to people, I could have been part of the high school newspaper, or take some classes where they teach you how to give speeches. After I graduated I had to take special courses online, because I did not know anything about periodism. If students decide what career they want, they will feel cofidents and they will act in the way that this career asks for them to act. They will become more mature and take high school as a more serious thing. Some of my old class mates from when I was in high school were always playing around and getting in trouble, because they said high school did not really teach you what you ""needed"", but I believe that they said that because they were not learning about what they really were interested on. They used to go to dance class when what they really wanted to become after was a lawyer, or a doctor. Other people believe that this will give students extra stress while they are thinking like an adult when they are in middle school. They believe that students are not old enough to decide what they really want, and that they might change their mind later. This people think that the best age for choosing a career is when the students have already graduated from high school. In conclusion I believe that this idea that the new society wants to implant to the students is good, because students should take high school seriously, they are super close to become adults and they will have to decide what they want to do with their life, and as sooner as they decide the most beneficial for them it will be.

To me those people that didnt work hard, dont know how failure feel like are the one that faster go down, cuz they dont care about it, unti they got there.

The students who have a job can have problems with their bosses and it can make a more hard schedule for the student because they dont gonna have any time to rest and they can have troubles at school if they dont rest the necesari for their health and their consentration at school; other negative thing is because its unnecessary because its not a big chage, if the school want to save energy one day dont gonna make a big change and also, maybe its okay as its and I think the original schedule with five days of school is good for all and it dont make any problem, and the last negative thing I see is the hours of work of the teachers, the teachers maybe dont do enough hours of work and dont get the same payment and maybe can affect them in that way. These idea also have positive things like the chance for students and teachers to rest more or just for students, they have more time to do homework or work, other positive thing is to save a bit of energy and some resources, in some way the school can get benefit of these.

Also those people who argue that there should be a year round schools and summer should be a 3-4 weaks break, it will be a less time break for most students who have planned to do their own projects while reading and without forgeting what they have learned. First, when students complete thier school year and started planning what to do for thier summer vaccation, spcially teens will put partying on the first list. There are some students who are doing worse than this, doing nothing but waiting for their friends party. Students dont realize that they are wasting thier time on partying untile the coming scholl year approaches. This doesnt just waste their time on thier vaccation when they can take classes online or school closer to where they live in but they are wasting thier money instead of saving it for their college tutition. Second, when someone goes for a trip, they will observe information and learn from what they have seen when travelling. On the other hand, when students are going for a trip, most of them will be taking pictures of themselves only without paying attention, observing ideas, or learning from what they see on the trip. If they were paying attention when travelling without just taking pictures of themselves, they were going to get benefitted for some classes like history and geography. Third, in the summer long vacation if students are not going to summer schools or studying at home, they definetly should be taking online courses to help them not to retain information as easily when they return to school on fall. When students are not studying ortaking classes over the summer, their brain is not developing which makes them not to be a creative or open minded. Plus, it is hard for most students who was enjoying summer without taking classes and getting back to school when it opens to understand like other students who have taken summer schools in their long vacation. In conclusion, I dont agree with the idea that there should be year round schools to prevent students from not retaining information when they return to new school year from their summer vacation. Instead of creating a year round schools, students can enroll themselves to summer school and study with their parents support. Additionally, if there is a longer winter break in the middle of the schools year, students most likely will forget what they have been taught before even finishing the full school year. Furthermore, long summer vacation is helpful to complete what one student has planned. As the matter of fact, even if there is a 3-4 week break in the summer, students will still not retain information easily when school starts if they dont use their vacation time wisely on purpose.",8,8,7,8,7,7,3871,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

My position on this issue, I think students would not benifits from being able to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because schools programmes its helping you to get more informations, learning more things to get high level. For example when you attend classes in the schools it will be conversations between the teachers and students about the term than you will benifits more informations and working between students like a groups its reason to get more knowledge. attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have attention like in schools classrooms because the teachers they helping you to understand and explaine more. When you have a research at schools attend classrooms you can use technology and books and you can work like groups it will be more easy to do your research. But when you have attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing you will not have a conversation between others students to get more knowledge. In my opinion, I prefer schools attend classes because when you focus with the teacher you will understand more about the term. For expample in my english class i pay attention at the class i can understand, and when i have a questions i ask my teacher to explaine for me. I desagree with students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some courses you cant take it at home because you you need to worked like a groups. For example when i have work to do at schoul classrooms we work together to make the exrcises or a topic easy, and when you get absent and you left some works the teachers helping you to do it. The schools classrooms programmes will help you about the time and they have specific time to work confortable and to know what have to do, some students they need support from they teachers and counselors to make sure they do alright. For example when i need support my teachers they support and they give me enough time to make i understand everythings. Students who choice to learn at home by way of online or video conferencing they will not get conversation with speaking with others and with teachers. For examlpe when you have to work on topic it will be hard for some students to understand more.

Then right after the game my mom had came to me and started crying because I told her that I was going to score 6 goals just for my grandfather and I did what I said I was going to do. That night I was praying and telling my grandfather that I had scored 6 goals just for him and I was saying to my head that I was going to do that more often. My next soccer game I had scored 5 goals but every time I go on the pitch I had always kissed my chain and touched the ground and point at the sky and I still do that today. My soccer game in 2 more weeks and I am going to do what I need to do to take my team to the championship and I will play all my soccer games just for my grandfather. All the soccer games I play they will always be for my grandfather and he will never forget that and if I have to do anything just to get some goals I will then just for him. When I was in Florida my grandfather had bought me a soccer poster and a soccer jersey of my favorite soccer player. He had got a jersey customize for that say my last name and my favorite which is number 7 and that is my favorite soccer player number to. When I was little he had always send me some of his drawing and like always write a little back that say I will always love u miyo and miyo mean son. When I was 10 years old he came down here to Virginia and he was visiting and he will always wake up at 4 o clock in the morning to go fora bike ride and when he came back he had always fix breakfast for us. In the afternoon he will always 1 v 1 me or my brother in soccer for some money like 10 dollars but that is if we beat him do. This why I play soccer just because of him. Like when I get frustrated in the soccer game I will always take a deep breath and think about my grandfather and that is what always calm me down when I get frustrated. He had always tell me if someone is talking trash always smile because that dont talk the most is the most strong ones in the game and I always tell them look at the score board. Here go the reason why I would like to go to Florida: Family and my grandfather grave. I would like to go to Generic_City studios. Go to the beach and get some nice weather. In conclusion, Where is one place you will like to visit? I would like to visit Florida because Florida have nice weather. Florida is something special to me because I have family down in Florida. The place I would like to visit is my grandfather grave. Another place I would like to visit is Generic_City studios because like your like in a movie because there are people that are dressed up as some characters. Another place I would like to visit is the indoor soccer field and play some soccer there with some family and maybe some new friends if I meet some there.

406,1188,C7AC45EF9D03,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". I absolutely agree with that statement, because in my opinion I see success as a goal that everyone on this earth should somehow reach to. However, its not that easy and not everyone is able to to that. For example, my father is a successful business man by helping others and our family, he has done a lot for me. He also took risks and failed multiple times in order for him to be successful in life. Not just because he has a lot of money, because otherwise not every rich individual is successful. You must fail in order to better yourself and learn from your mistakes, because that will benefit you in the long run. For me, I want to be a successful business man, just like my dad. I also want to travel around the world, and gain knowledge. but my goal for know is to pass all my classes with a high GPA, to show my parents and myself that I can do it. Yes, I failed one of my classes before but I didnt give up. As Winston said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Im going to keep working hard in order to graduate and chase my dreams, just like my father did. In the conclusion, I think that Winston said a true statement. I personally agree with him, because in order to be successful in life you will either need to learn from your personal mistakes or others. Thats honestly what I am doing right now, since Im still a teenager. Learning from others help you develop new skills and knowledge, especially from the old generation.

I chose stalyst professional because is interesting to do, you learn a lot about girls hairstyles and boys hairstyles I think is a really good job because a lot of people likes to do hairstyles and people likes to do haicuts because there is a lot of different things for example new hair color or a new hairstylt and stalyst is a really good job because you get a lot of money and you can do whatever you want with your own money but working hard.

Example: If your attitude is bein positive, and you are being nice with tha person his going to be nice also, and yuo would have more posibility to get it.

410,1192,44D6EEDAE5BD,"Most people will just act all childish just because they are having a bad day without even thinking that it can ruin their future. Bad impressions usually lead to failure, it can ruin opportunities, and people can also get themselves mistaken. I agree that someones first impressions are almost impossible to change because it can affect their future. Firstly to begin with, first impressions usually lead to failure in life when they are bad impressions. People need to learn how to act politely even if they are full of sorrow inside without showing it. When people make bad impressions about themselves, it always makes it harder for other people to see who that person really is. Loosing big opportunities always lead to a challenging future. Secondly another, bad impressions always ruin many opportunities for people, especially young people. It is an every day thing in the United States. People can loose job opportunities and it makes it harder for them to get a second chance. Second chances are really big deal, no one can live without them. If someone did some awful things and did not get another chance, then that person just lost an opportunity of a lifetime and is going to regret it for the rest of his or her life. Also, people get themselves mistaken all the time because of that. Other people will never see that person for who he or she really is when that person is acting in an unusual way which is not normal. They will look at that person as he introduced himself as. They would not want nothing to do with him. They would also think that he is mean even if he is just having a bad day. In conclusion, no one should let problems make them show a bad impression about themselves. Everyone has problems. They just need to learn how to control themselves and not make any scenes about it to embarrass themselves. They should know that the consequences are real and they are not games. People need to grow up, be responsible, act fairly, and be happy. ",7,9,7,7,7,7,895,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 9, cohesion 7"

Of coure, those two persons have different ideas. Forthermar, many people like to be leasy and they do not try to move on; Since, Other wants to move and work hard to make more opportunity. I agree with this stament, because this represent three nice pace to make others opportunity struggle, exploit, and related. However noeveryone agree. To begin, some of people think they cant make more option that they all ready have for some reasons. For intance, alots of people have not easy life some of they are not reach they do not have money to make more option. But, we has to know something thats true about this life thats nathing is going to be easy to make or do. For intance, one day before granfather deid he tell my a story how they were before his life. His life it was really hard before, they was not a family reach his five childreans only ate one time on some days. But he always said this words ""one day everything is going to change."" He never stop to belived that. After this terrible day he find other opportunities to make a different life for his family. Is why everyday I think careful, if you wants something ""I need to struggle."" Moreover, we can accomplish wonderful dreams, if we exploit the time. For intance, People can make many dreams so fast, also thing you never belived to get one day like a beautiful car, a big house, and other beutiful things. But you can get all this if you work hard and. In addition others people can give different life, because you have how to help othres. All the person who never stop work that person always make so many things Finally, be related everyday this is something special. Because you always are looking for something more than one. That means you not stop in one street you always are try to gross the other way. For intance, one day I was thinking how to make my dream fast and how to get it. An I said If we are people who like to find different option we are going to get it. And that is all this is a reflection to know how you can get everything in your life, but you has to know this if you never go in from nathing is going to happen. In short, the ideas is to tell you how many opportunities or dreams you can make, if you move to one side to the other sides. For example people who not try to move more far away they never is going to make something different, and that so sad because you never are going to know how many special dreams you can had, but that is going to happen if you dont move to the other side, but if you work hard and you always look for more you always are going to have everything in your life. For intance, you want a car and the car the cost is one million you will buy that car why, because you work hard and you have the money so you will have the money for buy this types of cars. Struggle and you will have everything you want, exploit go outside and find others opportunities not lose you time the time run very fast everyday, you are going to cry one day may be because you was leasy and that is going to be sad for you, the last try to be related because there is the way you are going to find many option for make you life different.

412,1194,E06EDBA28C44,"Some people say that aim too high is not for them. This should be because people does not feel ready. Some people would want to aim high, but they do not want to know how would be the outcome. Although, some people think that aim too high is a waste of time, nevertheless, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals because some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. My first reason is that some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail. For example, if a person aim too high but fail that person would not feel good about him. Some times people who fail get depressed. If that is a humans who is a persistent person he would be trying more time. Until that person achieve their big goal. Also, that kind of people who are persistent that always keep trying that people one day they achieve all their goals. In addition, the key to have a awesome overcome is to never give up and never stop. My second reason is that some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. People who do this are people that always want the easy thing. These people does not want to effort that much and achieve their goals. However, these people do not know the significant of have something that took a lot of efforts. In addition, some people may say that if they aim low they can achieve more things in the time a person that aim too high. Thats not the point, the thing is that every human have to effort to know the significant of never give up. Also, when humans has owned something by their own effort the valuate more what they had achieve. In summary, humans really need to set their aim too high to know if they would achieve their goals. Some humans thinks that they are not prepare to aim too high and fail and some humans prefer to aim low and achieve their goals. Also, on these latest years humans has been lazy than doesnt want to effort to do big things and achieve it. Now humans really needs to efforts for something.

413,1195,CC24D88BEB8E,"I agree with Churchills idea that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm; Although, many people believe that failure will take you down and make you doubt about your potential; however, failure also help you to progress, gives you different ways to achive your goals, and makes you become even stronger than what you were before failing. Failure is always there, a lot of times we thing failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you efor even much harder situations, if you dont fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress. Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it give you choices and failure let you know the things you couldve done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didnt know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but i didnt give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kicked it with more precission. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way. Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail and you are beaten down and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesnt give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it. Edison was asked ""How does it fell to fail 100 times?"", and he answered, ""I didnt failed, the light bulb was a proyect that took 100 steps to be done"". In conclusion, failure and mistakes help you learn from them, failure gives you other ways to accomplish your goals and it makes you stronger than what you were before, I think people shouldnt be afraid of failure, they have to start failing, because when they get to reach their goals, their satisfaction when they achive it, its going to be even bigger.",7,6,6,6,6,6,2794,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
414,1196,AD6986B56719,"Michelangelo once said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If youre setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and youll most likely get no satisfaction out of it. Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that youll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; theyll want a hard working and determined individual. A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car youve always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if youre not getting any of those youre doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person. Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why youre not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person. In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelos statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you cant complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.",8,9,9,9,9,7,2335,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

I agree that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because some students rather attend to a class at home than at the school so they can focus more; However, some students suffer from bullying, and they rather stay at home and study than attend to school and get bullied again and again. Attend to school at home is a different type of learning is at your own place you got peace. Attend to school at home is different when you talk about focus, at home, you at your own place quiet, you dont have people around you to stop you or distract you. One day at high school I was trying to focus for a test retake but I coudnt because my friend kept distracting me and that made fail my retake. If I was at home learning in peace without distractions maybe I would pass the test. The point is that studying at home is quiet and calm what can help you successfully at your school grades. One of the biggest reasons students attend to classes at home is due to bulllying every high school students suffer from bullying whats is wrong but we cant change people we got sometimes you got to change your strategy so you can live a healthy life, thats why some students decide instead of getting bullied every day attend to school at home. I had a problem at freshman year that ive got bullied every time because of how skinny I was and I was kind sad, all my grades went down and I didnt knew what to do;Therefore, if I decided to attend school at home I woudnt have to face this problem every school day.

Therefore, students benefit from being able to attend classes at home, you can focus more and you is a option that you can take if you have any obstacle in your way at school such as bullying or something like that, nowadays is more common to see people taking online classes. All the schools should have online classes that you can take at home so every student can study the way they want to study;Therefore, students benefit by being able to attend classes at home.",7,5,6,5,5,7,2326,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
421,1203,6DFD772CFC64,"School required students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during the break. The time we live on right now students should get projects over the summer, so they can prepared for college and other things in life this is why the schools are giving them work so they dont forget about school and keep learning everyday. While some people around the world say that teachers should design the summer project for the students. It is better for the students to design their own summer project because they have better ideas, Can make their projects less stressful, and make it more fun with their friends. All students in the world have better ideas to how to design your own project and make it better. Students have better understanding of what they want to do for there project like having better ideas and knowing what they want to work on. Cristiano Ronaldo wrote a article about why is good students should design their projects and why teacher should let them design their own article. Cristiano Ronaldo is a soccer star but he went to high school and know what the students want to do and design. He wrote on the article that students brain is still developing;he said that if students keep making their own decision and teachers let them choose their designs of projects they can come up with better ideas that other people cannot even think about. In the article he wrote that we students have a amazing brain and we can come u with the best ideas and design of projects that no one else cant. Everyone keep saying that teachers should make the designs of students projects for the summer. Students of everywhere can make there project design less stressful if they get to choose what they can do. When students get to design there own project is less stressful for them because they can choose how they want to do it. Leonel Messi came to every high school in the united states to talk about how stressful is when teacher give students projects over the summer. They make us work super hard and is super hard to communicate with their teacher over the summer. He talk to us that picking our own projects is way better than teachers picking the design because we can make our own ideas and it is less stressful and that is going to be easier. When students pick their design they dont need to worry about asking question to their teacher and stressing out. Messi told us that when he was in high school,he used to choose his own design of project because it was less stressful and more fun to do. when people keep saying that teacher should choose our design it so stressful because us as student want to choose our design for our summer project. People in all high schools keep saying that is more fun for students to make our design of project ,because it makes our studies more fun and incredible. The mother of my friend ones told me that there is nothing more fun than getting to design a project as a student. She told me that when she was in high school their teacher choose the project for them and that wasnt fun for no student. Thats why she told me that is more fun to get to choose your own design of project because when teachers get to choose them is super boring and stressful students sometimes cry. She told me that If i had the chance to make my own design to take it because it was not going to be fun to if the teacher choose the design. It is going to be more fun if you get to choose your own design for the summer project because i can get to make it with my friends and probably family members. Never let your teacher choose design the summer project for the students. While other people might say that these summer projects should be teacher designed because the student keep learning more and keep working hard;however, if students make their own summer project design it is way better because student have better ideas, less stressful, and get to have more fun while doing the project. Messi gave us a great talk about how to choose your own design of project can make every students less stressful. Students around the world have a ruff time trying to do projects that their teacher gives them over the summer. Teachers should let students choose their own design so students can relax and have fun over the summer and they can keep doing there project and still have time to have fun with family and friends. Every student around the world should start making their own design for their project. ",6,7,6,6,5,6,1436,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

I would want to visit Ethiopia because I havent visited in over three years, lots of things has changed from then to now. But those past couple of years in Ethiopia wasnt the best for people who live there or who has family there. For Example my grandpa died a couple days after my 11th birthday and even though I didnt cry, scream, or kick that day or the day after that, it made a horrible impact on my life and my mothers. Secondly, There was a plane crash this year, more than 200 people were affected and one out of those 200 people happened to be one of my close friends. In addition to that there was a war a couple months ago that I didnt know about till a friend came up to me and said ""How do you feel about the war thats going on in Ethiopia"" I didnt know what to say because I had no clue that there was a war I felt ashamed that I didnt know what was going on in my own country. Ive lost a lot of people ive cared about those past three years and I couldnt do anything about it because i was a million miles away. Secondly, most of my family members live in Ethiopia. I hate having to talk to them on the phone and not being able to hug or see them in person, I hate having only 30 minutes to talk on the phone when I can talk to my relatives for hours in person, I hate how I am paying two dollars everyday just to talk to them when we can talk for free in person. Since I havent seen my family members in a long time I feel like I have a obligation to see them. I can get them small things from America and bring it to them, they can sell it to get lots of money because one dollar here is $30 there or they can keep it and cherish it. Finally, Once I arrive I would want to talk to my family members, go eat Ethiopian food with them, and cherish that moment forever. I would go on long car rides because it would make some time for me and my family members to just sit and talk and have no where to go. We can go to the zoo since I never went and I would love to bond with my family members especially if its somewhere I never went before. My family members and I could have a cook out or I can just sleepover a friends house. In conclusion, I would love to visit Ethiopia because my family and friends are there since ive missed so much while I was in America.

425,1207,1D944BF5BE87,"Yes I think it is a good idea for students to plan their career early because students can be prepared for the real world, it can help with jobs, and it could help them in college. When students graduate they will face challenges . They have to find a job to support their needs. Students will also need to find what they want to do in life to make them be successful. A planned career really gives a head start to those who want to achieve more and be prepared. The real world is tough if you dont have a plan because it can be too late to accomplish goals. Planning at a young age gives students advantages for their work. This also helps with a students resume if they want to attend college. Jobs want students who are successful and take work seriously. When a student graduates they want to make it in life and not struggle. Another reason students should plan early is for jobs. A job gets people money and they can use this for more school or for other needs. A planned job at a young age is a very good head start for many reasons. Students can save up for college or by a vehicle. An early job gives them a lot of experience and helps benefit when they look for more places to work outside of school. More reasons students should plan their careers early is for college. College helps keep them in school giving more education. More education and knowledge also helps students get better jobs. Getting better jobs helps students make more money for their future. The money helps support their needs for example like owning a house. Some people today dont want to go to college which does not mean they wont be successful. Sometimes students prefer to find better jobs to make a living without anymore education. When students dont plan ahead that also does not mean they are always too late for anything. Students would sometimes need more time to figure want they want to do in life.

Should people make their own decisions about life important matters,or should they ask someone else for their opinion. People should ask for guidance from experts about life important matters. There are times when depression comes and stress appears because,of bad decisions made by one-self. If people do not ask for experts guidance, there is a possibility that in the future the decision they have made, might affect them in the future and cause a fatality like, depression which can lead to deadly thoughts and mental problems like bipolarity. Depression is one of the most know in all over the world which is caused by,bad decisions,over working by mental and physical jobs, family problems, and an unhealthy life style which all of this can lead to suicide thoughts. For example, one of the most famous singers from United States Sia known for her most popular song ""chandelier"", she committed many bad decisions which had lead her to drug addiction. Her fame was getting higher; and many contracts for more shows where she had it to attend to, were exploding her head which lead it to an over working stage. She has an amazing soprano voice, with more than five different tones, and because of that, different music productions wanted to sign a contract with Sia, but she instead of taking a rest she decided to continue, knowing in which stage her body was passing through, she decided to take drugs to cover her stress but, instead of taking away her stress she became a drug addict which lead her to suicide, but thanks to the doctors she is alive; now she keeps being one of the most popular singers but, because of her pass, she covers her face with long hair bangs to the top of her upper lip; and no own has seen her face since that incident. Also, bad decisions might lead to mental problems like bipolarity, and sadly most of the cases are seen in schools where parents and teachers do not notice until is late for that youth to recover, because of his or her bad decisions that this students had made. For example, a student from a school in Virginia known for his great intellectual was passing through a rough time, he had to go to work every single day after school from Monday to Monday his hours to school were from 7:30 Am to 2:15 Pm, and his work hours were from 2:30 PM to 10:30 PM every single day. He never gave up he always was the top student of his class, but there were times where his parents were putting more pressure, and Test were near to come and work was getting more and more exhausted until one day he exploded. The day of hes graduation arrive and his most treasure sister wasnt able to accompany him because she was getting into the same stage that he already pass through. After his graduation he wanted to have a life and do what he always wanted to do since he was a child which was being in the Marine, he was already in a bad state because of all the pressure he gent through but, he wanted to fallow his dream. One Saturday in the morning he decided to apply for the Marine but, sadly he was not accepted because of his migratory circumstances and because of that, hes brain collapsed in a stage of dementia, but his mother instead of giving an affection, she got mad and told him ""Stop, you are a man already, act like one"", the only one who tried to calm him down was his little sister who did not know what to do but to say ""He needs some experts help, he needs to go to see a doctor in that way, we can make a good decision and know what to do"". After all of this happened he went to a mental hospital where he was hospitalized for three long months and now he is living a life with medications from an expert who helped him to go through all of this where he was diagnosed with bipolarity.

428,1210,3D8CF58944E1,"I think schools shouldnt add one and a half hours more to schools because kids need time to rest there brains, have enough time to make it on time to there after school activities, and students need more time to finish up their homework and studying. First, kids need time to rest there brains by going outside, and watching on the TV for a little. If schools add more time, then students will not have any time to have fun which causes them to not have much time to sleep, less time to sleep effects their school day. An example of that is if I had extra time to my school then I would have had no time to play, take a nap, or watch youtube. That causes me to not have enough sleep time. This type of rule is not healthy for the students. Second, kids need time to make it to there after school activities. after school activities are usually straight after school, but if students add more time to school then kids will not make it to his or her after school activity. An example is if a student had to go to football practice everyday at 4:00, then students would not make it if school ended at 4:15. without physical education and only just education by sitting in a chair just writing and reading is not healthy for your body. thats why students need more time for there after school activities. this is also bad because it effects your sleep time also which makes you tired for school the next day. Last, students will not have enough time to finish up there homework from all the time from school and other stuff they have to do at home. For an example is if there was a test the next day, and I havnt studied so I had to study, I wouldnt have had enough time to study because the extra time in school or if I had to do an after school activity. This is not good for students to add time to school so they do not have enough time to study or finish homework because they will not get a good grade on the test or quiz and especially get a bad grade in the class. Back to the thesis, they should not add an hour and a half of school because it will effect our brain, body, and grades.

I think is good idea because all student that want a best future try to do a good thing that it is a benefit for the school. when a student is smart make the time important for take other course for to have for credit is for that some student dont need to take the four grade in the high school, A student also that have excellent grade in all the classes, and only have a difficult classes, this student that had the opportunity for graduated early that other students. Example: A student of Generic_School is in 9 grade, but this student have a difficult classes, but this students is focus just in the classes, and have a excellent grade also this student take a deport after school all the days. The student hes prepared every time for the quiz, and for test. Finish the school the student is the best student of the year in the school because He passed all the classes and the SOL. During the summer He go to the summer school for to pass other class that he going to have in 10 grade, finish the summer school He pass the class with excellent grade, so this student had a so much credit of the normal. He stars the 10 grade, so He had other advanced classes, because in summer school he pass the classes that He was going to have in 10 grade. This student continue that, He pass all the classes, and SOL that He need for graduated. Now this students is in 11 grade, but the student had a big credit and He go to the school for 4 classes so this student have the opportunity for graduated in 11 grade because is a excellent student. He finally is graduated the school in 11 grade, so He finish the school, but He said that want to go the collage because want to prepare more for to go to the university, because He want to be a excellent lawyer. The excellent student finish the collage, and the university, so now He is a big lawyer with a great statutes.

Many student wants to have a excellent grade but dont put of they part for be a good students. Now in day the most students just want to come to school for 3 or 4 classes but dont want study for had a good grade,many students go to school but dont go the classes, and other students is stay outside of school for smoky, because the most students used cigarette or other thing. We dont know appreciated the best opportunity of the life. Reasons for graduated in three year All students who graduated early have a big opportunity in the collage, and the university, and the work or whatever place. why? because the old person thinking that this type of person are responsible in all the thing. Are a people responsible! Why? because when have a big responsibility never said NO and have care for all thing. Example: Im Generic_Name, I work in Bank Of America, today my boss need to leave early because He had a compromised with other important person, and He give me the responsibility for received the money of today. Be carefully! Why? because they try to make with carefully the work or whatever thing. Example: My name is Generic_Name, and I work a company of cake, and my supervisor said me congratulation because you are very carefully with the work all the time. My Idea! I think all the people we have the best opportunity in the life to be a best person in the live,but the major opportunity is that when we have somebody is protected, and supported our decisions. When we start the education needed to keep the marge for be the person who we want to be. The thing are best when we support all bad thing. The best idea is continue with the school and be a good students, because all student that it is educated, they type students have a more opportunity that other who they dont want to be a best person in the future. Why the younger people just thinking in pass the life in party or in the street? Why now in day we see a kids abandoned in the street? Because many mother dont have a good education for to have a compromise of the had a kids, this type of mother just thinking in that the drugs,alcohol,or party is the major thing. Many mother having a bad decisions! So is for that what we need to prepare for to make more easy our life. Have a diploma of the High School is very important because we work less, and we have a good job,when we have a good job we have a lot money, and when this happened we are prepare for take a funny moment in our life, But just for that is not the base for make whatever thing, first we need think what we need to do! We know that this life is so hurt, and is more hurt when we take a bad decision like not finish the school or dont put care to our thing for to be prospered. Some time is good help take course when the people dont finish the school. Example: take a course for by the license, and put a beauty salon. take a course for by idea how to have a company of electricity. take a course for be some body also a little important in the life. take a course for be a teacher of music. We have so much course for prepare more when we dont finish the school. Some time when a students go to the school, and they not finish is responsibility of the parent guardian because the parent need to see for the son or daughter keep going the school, I think when the students dont finish the school part of this is fault of the parents. How we can finished the school, and how can I do graduated? The things for to finished the school is: Go to the school every day. Make the homework. Prepared for the quiz or test. Pass all the SOL. Pass all the classes. When you make all the work in the classes or in the school, and you pass all the thing, you can graduated. If you not want to go to the collage, the diploma of the High School is very important for have a good job in your life.

430,1212,1F28812EE23D,"This assay is going to be about a thing that some businesses are doing which is to make a four day work week adding two hours to the regular work days. This essay will have my opinion if we should implement this idea in my school or not. I will talk about some advantages and disadvantages about the implement of this idea to my school. I will suggest some action that a shool should take before the implementing of this idea of this idea. Imagine that you recieve a letter from your school saying that they are planning implement and idea which is to make students come to school four days instead of five adding two hours to the normal day of school. I disagree with this idea because it will affect my school which is a high school, instead of helping it. The first thing that will be affected will be the after school program and activities. If my school add two hours to our schedule each day will consist in ten hours, so students will be more tired and less student will be interest in involving in after school programs so the school might cancel them. I would said that it will affect a high school especially because there are a lot of juniors and siniors that work after school and it can cause to most of them to quit their jobs. Implementing this idea to our school have some advantages and disadvantages as well. One advantage of adding two hours to our schedule are that we will have more time to do our work in school because classes should be longer. Another advantage is that this idea help to conserve energy and resources of the school. A disadvantage is that after school programs might be closed because not so many people will be interested in that. The other disadvantage is that some students might have to change their jobs hour which is not easy and some of them would have to opt for quiting their jobs. Before adding this idea to my school or any school they should ake some actions before. First the school staff should make a meeting to discuss the idea. Then they should make another meeting but this time including the parents of the students. In which they explain to them in what the idea consist. Next they should send a letter home in which the idea is well explained but this time parents have to sign the letter and say wether they agree to the implement of the idea or desagree. Finally after doing all this now the school can decide wether the idea is being implemented or no. In conclusion I disagree with implementing this idea to my school because it will affect the school instead of helping it. I would say that this idea have a lot of desadvantages too. For example the school might cancel after school activities, some students might lose their jobs, and we will get home more tired. I think that the schedule thath my school have right now is just great because students play sports, participate in after school programs, and some others can work too. I think that my school should not implement this idea because we are fine with the schedule that we have and adding two hours will just affect us instead of being beneficial.

Working together is more beneficial because with a group you can get all the work done more faster and students are less worried. Many students should work together as a team in school because it helps them with good life skills life. People might need this to help them when working at a job in the future. I agree that working with a group is more efficient and help students learn more better. Benefits of working with a group is more beneficial because allows students to collaborate, allows different ideas or opinions from peers, and allows each individual to have feedback from peers. However not everyone would agree with this position. Some people believe that benefits of working alone is more helpful for themselves. For example, when a students is working on the computer for a certain projects in fashion marketing, fitness and foods or other subjects in school because theyre able to finished it themselves. This explains that people can put their own ideas and will get the work done more quicker without any help from peers during class. Nevertheless the oppositions over looks other important points. First reason is that student can collaborate with other peers but only about 30% of people work together with other people on school projects assignments or activates. For example, in classrooms students have more possible chances to separate the task with each other. Also people wouldt have to worried about not getting each slides done because their peers would be there to support them. This shows that students who work together with peers they are not only benefiting themselves but helping other people too. Students can enjoy and have fun working with friends also everyone will get a good grade. Second reason is students can come together as a team by listening and hearing out all of their peers creative ideas and opinions in a group on the project. For example, each person might have a good suggestion or reason on a history project that will help their group with the assignment. This shows a person will have many ideas that they can chose from a peer in their group and its always nice to use different reasons from a student. Third reason is when a student can get a individuals feedback to help them on a english writing essay in class. For example, the person is writing a essay for class on Google docs with each other it helps them talk and get feedback from a peer or friend in class. This shows that having a students help is important because you can fix the error in the essay with a peers correction and students can learn more better together from people. To conclude that working with a group is more better for people because allows students to collaborate with peers so that people can separate the task with each other, allows different ideas or opinions from peers when each person has good suggestions for projects and allows individuals to get feedback from peers on helping a students with a english writing essay. Maybe good for students to work alone but working in a group is helpful to have someone support them. ",7,6,6,5,4,6,3143,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Because being our self is mean trust our self. Not believing to any one who come to as, and till as any thing to Change as. then reaching our goal by trusting our self. For example. Being our self shows those people how strong we can be,and continuing our way to improve. In a word that we see people change accomplishment. We should trust our self to not change. To a bad person, or any thing that a society try to make as. Trusting our self and continuing our way to improve more. to show a society how strongly we trust our self. So that way we keep our self in better way. Also i believe we can progress people around as. Because it show people that they can do same as we do. When we see that some people really try to change as. Or a society that is Changed already, and they are following a different ways to improve their life. Also they try to change as as the way they want it. To follow their way, and we know that it is not the way we can improve. So to be our self, and we chose to improve our life in other rule. It is because we see something that is not going right, but the society has changing. Also it looks when those people try to improve, and they get that, they heard other people. and they dont know they rich something they effect some other thing that they dont know about about. I believe it is not acceptable for as to do the same to heard some people. Then we should follow some other way to our life. Clearly "" is society that is constantly trying to make as change in highest improvement.(Author Ralph Waldo Emerson) I should believe to my self. That i can rich my goal successfully. progress on the thing that i need and want. So i should not let ant one to turn me from my goal. Because there is some people who want as, to not rich our goal or dreams. To advents my self i would work so hard. But is some people who is trying to fail as in our way to rich our goal. Then going to embrace as for are fail, also try to stop as to rich that dream. But i believe if we trust our self, and have a big goal to rich to. It will be possiball to get it. Then no one can get our way to stop as. being our self trusting to our goal, and respect our self, makes people to respect as. As will as we do to them. Also reaching our goal dreams In a right way. But being in a society that people as changed. then try in to change me. SO i see the can improve but in not right way, and not respect between people. So then i believe i should be my self. finally I believe it is good idea to be our self. and do the things that makes as happy about it. So if see in society that is changing, and see some people trying to, Change me. Even i do the right thing to improve. But those people saying to so the thing other, i know that is not right to do it. Because they way the are saying it could heard people. but they jut look forward to improve.

434,1216,C51C5EA029D6,"There are many other ways, how we can choose our character traits. The first way is to choose our own character traits, by picking it for ourself. The second way is our character formed by influences beyond our control, by not being able to control it. The most reasonable character trait would be choosing our own character trails, because it makes the most sence out of all and most of the population can control on their emotions. There are different types of character traits, for example funny, exiciting, joyful, and many more. Our character traits are formed by our own influence and by our own actions. Thats what causes them to react from different types of emotions. For the most part, we are able to control our emotions, but sometimes we cannot control over them so they go out of control. Character traits can be used in many different ways. However, there are some character traits that we cant control, it would happened to us by itself because we sometimes dont have control on ourself. For example anger, sadness, and depression are the reasons why we lose control sometimes because we are unable to control over it. These emotions can be dangerous once you are out of control, you dont even know what you will be doing, it could be something really terrible. Thats the reason character traits can be good or bad sometimes. Some people support the fact to pick there character traits for themself, some think its not in our control and we are unable to control it. The people that said they decide to choose the character traits for themself, say when they do something they can feel the emotions in contol of them and do what best fits them. On the other hand, the people that think the charater traits is not in there control, say if they are working or doing anything the emotions of them just happens and they cant control it. In most of the cases it is caused by the bad emotions like being mad, or sad and more. There are many more reasons of people talking about character traits. Not all of them are good nor not all of them are bad. It mainly depends on the person who is controling it. For the people that are unable to do so can control over it by doing couple simple things and not letting there emotions take over them.

435,1217,E9E68651B168,"I disagree on extending school hours. I disagree because if the school board adds more morehours to school, students wont pay much attention to the teacher or staff. Another reason is that students will start disrespecting teachers because they have too many hours and they will start to get more tired or start to go a sleep. I also think that teachers might get anoyed by students replying on why the school board added extra hours of school. I think that instead of adding the extra hours to school, the school board should just make the extra hours optional after school. This should take place after school so kids can come and learn more about life and school. First of all, I disagree because if the school board adds more hours to school students wouldnt be able to concentrate or pay attention in class. I believe that if students dont pay attention in class or to the teacher, the teacher will get very upset and students will start to get in trouble or would start losing points. I believe that the students dont pay attention in class or to the teacher, they would begin to be disrespectful to teachers and wont be respectful to others. I believe that students should tell their parents to do something about the school board wanting to increase the amount of hours in school. Kids should work very hard and keep up the good work and not be disrespectful to others or to the teacher. Second of all, I dont agree because I think that students will start to disrupt or question their teacher about why the school board wants to change or increase the amount of hours students have in school. They are going to start asking a lot of question and their teacher isnt going to like that. I think that students should ask the school board why they are going to increase the amount of hours in school. Students should talk to their parents on why the school board is extending the amount of hours. Students should just be able to do the normal hours of school instead of doing extra. Third of all, I believe that the school board shouldnt increase the amount of hours the should just make it an after school activity. I think that the school board should just make it an after school activity instead of increasing the amount of school for students. The school board shouldnt extened the school hours for students because students can just study hard for something or teachers should go over the subject the are learning about so they can learn and understand. If they just stay after school theyh will get so board and they wouldnt want to be there. I decline on the idea that the school board wants to increase more hours for students. I decline beacuse students will get very bored and wouldnt want to do anything. The school board should think it over again and not extend or increase the amount of hours for school.

437,1219,7CAFF57E1775,"Dear principal, I have heard of the school cafeterias plan to change to a new healthier school lunch. And as a junior in this school,I take the position that this new dynamic idea to change the schools lunch menu is a bad idea. So I have decided to share my thoughts for the development of this school and with our health. I believe that keeping our schools lunch menu is a good idea. I know that my opponents would argue with me regardlessly,because they would probably assume that our students have been eating the same food for too long and would definetely want to have a different versions of food,and get to explore their school lunch like other schools usually do. But when they detect my reasons,they would know for sure that the schools lunch is way better than they think it is. My initial reason for not agreeing to this change is that it would eradicate some students favorite cafeteria foods, especially me,There are a lots of food currently in the cafeteria that are so good, clean and healthy. they are also enough food for everyone to eat, so changing the menu wouldnt be necessary, it would be a waste of time and money. the school has got a bunch of stuff to focuse on. Americans have this quote that "" if you have lemons make lemonades"" meaning we should make the best out of what we have by embracing it not changing it. In additon, the current schools lunch menu is technically healthy, I have this extraordinary thoughts in my mind because I havent seen any student that has protested against the schools lunch, this means that the current school lunch is unique on its own way. Also the school lunch is potentially some of the amazing healthy American foods. Again,Most American foods are junky and cause students to gain weight chronically and gradually. But our current food consists of fruits,vegetables and also green salad which prevents the body from gaining too much weight and sustain the normal body weight. I have been eating our schools green salad for a while and l have seen some fantastic changes in my body and it is very impressive. So principal, dont you think that changing our schools cafeterias lunch menu is a bad idea? For instance, our school cafeterias lunch has got protein,Vitamin D and my weight is intact, as far as our health is concerned, so take all of these reasons into consideration and figure out your final answer,I hope that you make the right choice for the school and l know that the schools improvement is your priority.

I think it would be a good idea for students to be able to graduate with three years of high school, with the same idea that they will have to take summer courses and evenings to get all credits in three years, and the advantages of that would be that they will get out of school earlier and be able to star college, work, and a career at a earlier age, and also for students who dont like to spend too much time on school stuff, that would be like a way to get out of that faster and achieve their goals quickly, i have some friends that they graduated earlier because they had good grades, which made them have enough credits to graduate,and they doing good right now, because now they in college and achieving their goals, and i believe it would be a good idea to give other students the same opportunity, if they want to take it.",6,6,6,6,7,6,3360,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
439,1221,D581D89A822A,"Should people make their own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters? People should make their own decisions because if you trust your decision there is no reason why you should ask someone else. Putting some trust on your decision can help you do what is right or wrong. However, part of your decision needs to come from your heart. Firstly, If you want to accomplish a dream in your life you need to put some extra work trying to get it done. Also, getting it done is not going to be easy but sometimes you need to try. For example, lets say you are a soccer player and you have a game but you dont trust your team mates what is going to happen is that you might lose that game. I know is hard to trust someone who doesnt act or look the same as you. I would take my decision and ask my self should I trust them or not? Secondly, trusting your team will not always be the same but you should follow your instincts. Example, one day I made a bad decision of not cleaning the back yard of my house for like three months and it was fall and what happened was that it got full of leaves. If you take wrong decisions will cause you things that you dont want. When I saw my back yard full of leaves I ask to myself why did I make the decision of not cleaning the back yard. Ideas are part of what you should take seriously in your life. The idea of going to school should be one of the most important things you should do. Thirdly, asking for help in taking a decision is not a bad idea. However, every day or every time you want to ask someone for help you must know who you are asking. For example, if you want to ask someone what you should do after graduation must come from you but sometimes you can ask questions to your family and talk about it, they might know what is the right thing you should do. People agree with you taking your own decisions than doing what other says. Other unknown persons decision is what you should never do in your personal life. What I do when I have to take a decision of doing something is to think the decision twice. In conclusion, never give up a decision of you doing the right thing. Always do what your parents says or ask you to do because they are the ones who wants you to accomplish your dreams, be there when they need you, talk to them when you need to. Other people who you should talk to are your siblings. ",7,6,7,6,7,8,2973,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Second of all, A failure shows up the real people. Third and most important, try not to do the same failure over and over. ""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes. Second of all, a failure shows up the real people because those who you think are good friends would help you on a failure. the person that you thought was the worst could be the only one helping you. An example, A real girlfriend would never run away in your first failure.

There is always gonna be more failures in our lives but, if u dont even pass one it would be more difficult to pass more then one at the same time.

Some people can even scuba-dive if they have the experience. Most people like to spend time outdoors,for example,they can invite some friends over for some barbecue. People like to spend time outdoors doing fun stuff like Snowboarding. Snowboarding is a cool way of spending time outdoors,because a lot of children like to play in the snow,so snowboarding is a fun way of playing in the snow. There are so many outdoor events like,Easter and partying. A lot of children like to hunt for Easter eggs during Easter,because they find eggs,candy and so on. Sometimes,most people like to go to outdoor-clubbing to chill,relax, and relieve stress. Some other people dont like to spend time outdoors during the night because they either dont have time or they have important things to do. Mostly,during the Summer,most parents take their children outdoors to teach their kids how to ride their bikes. Eventually,people might find the activities mentioned above enjoyable,because they get to tell their friends their parents thought them how to ride a bike and skateboard,they could assist their friends. People like to spend time outdoors with friends than stay home alone and do nothing. They could try and teach themselves how to ride their bikes. If parents stay outdoor with their children on a campsite,they could make smores with a campfire and enjoy. In conclusion,people should stay out more often so they can learn how to snowboard,skateboard,bike ride,rock-climb,roller-skating,surfing,camping,hiking,scuba-diving and jet-skiing.

446,1228,14D2867090F2,"Philosopher, physician, humanitarian Albert Schweitzer said,"" Example is not the main thing in influencing other; it is the only thing. I believe that if you show good behavior while working or simply going to school with a good behavior that some people will follow your attitude and want to have a positive way on life, however there are other ways of showing good behavior, for example you can help your mother with the groceries and help take the dog for a walk, some might think that good behavior is for the weak, but to be honest it shows that you are mature and that you know how to act around other people or places. If you continue with good behavior you have a higher chance that you will be respected in society even in your own home. good behavior is really a life skill you need for example, your trying to get a job, how are you going to behave in front of the employer? your going to act like a mature adult and tell him that your looking for a job so you can buy a house or a car. so you need to behave correctly in any given situation. It can be hard to behave correctly because some people are very disrespectful and like to get on other peoples nerves, but in the end your the one that set a example to everyone else that you know how to act in any situation. dont let other people get to you because then your going to justlash out on everyone else and thats going to make you look bad no matter what. you hsve to show that you are well behaved in any type of enviroment weather its at your house or at work or even at the movie theater you still have to show that you know how to act.

449,1231,A00A8837B25B,"Anybody is capable of doing anything no matter how bad obstacles can get. Failure is one of the biggest reasons why most of people are successful. Although people believe setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is less dangerous than aiming high and failing, nevertheless, aiming low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger because theres no limits to what people can do and failure gives motivation to work harder to achieve more and be successful in life. To begin, setting our aim low, and achieving our mark is a greater danger than setting our aim high and falling short because theres no limits to what a human being can do and achieve. For example, Isaiah Thomas, he was one of the best basketball players in the NBA at Boston. Hes very short, and everyone doubted him and said hes too short and cant make it. That didnt stop him from aiming high and achieving his goal and becoming of one the shortest people to make it to the NBA. This shows that no matter who the person is, they can accomplish a lot in life as long as they work hard. Clearly, everyone should always aim high and accomplish their goal to have a better life later on. Furthermore, people should always aim high even if they fall short because failure gives motivation to achieve more and come back stronger. For instance, The Golden State Warriors lost the NBA finals in 2016. It was one of the worst finals ever for them. They lost very badly, but that didnt stop them from coming back the next year and winning the championship. This proves that it doesnt matter how bad failure can be, as long as they come back from it stronger. Obviously, no should be scared of failure and everyone should aim high and try to be the best at whatever they do. Overall, the greater danger for most of people lies in not trying their hardest to be someone in life and aiming low to accomplish their goal because failure motivates the person to comeback stronger and have no limits. In conclusion, Aiming high will get anyone successful as long as they keep working hard and fear nothing.",9,8,8,8,9,8,2142,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
450,1232,E0538F7AB083,"I agree with this statement, first impressions with people or places are difficult to changed. But first the definition of Impression is a lasting effect, opinion, or mental image. Is a belief of understanding of sth. Here is a example in a sentence, I made a bad impression by arriving late for the interview. I always see the bad and good things in each person and in each places too. But sometimes the impressions can change, It depends on the person. Now Im gonna make some examples about the first impressions in people and with places. For example, If Im going to a restaurant the first impressions that Im looking for, are If the local is cleanly(floor, chairs, etc..), the bathroom they arent dirty, the employers(making sure that they are using gloves when they touch the food and when they prepair the food, Plague(rats, cockroach, etc..) thats very important because we dont want to get transmit a bacteria or something like that). Another example, If Im going to a friend house, my first impressions that Im looking for, are typically the same of the restaurant, instead of the part of the employes(obviously), but if the house is dirty, for example: (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, etc...) that impressions can change for me, because they probably clean the house everyday, but just that day they dont clean it. And now Im gonna make some example of first impressions for a person, the first impression that I saw in a person is the personality(vibes, etc..), the education level(respectful, responsable, etc..), the way of she/he dress it(outfits) thats when the phrase ""dress to impress"" takes place, if the person is comic, etc.. Some person do the same, but some person just talk in the bad way of other persons, and sometimes they dont know them, they dont talk to them, and thats too bad impression for the person that is doing that, they are wrong :/ So my point, is I just said before, the impressions can change and it depends on the person.

Some people believe that technology has a bad effect on people; however, technology can be very educational to students, people can save a lot of time while shopping, and it can help people stay healthy. Technology can be educational for students and teachers. For example teachers can tell students to download apps that are used for education and students can learn on there. Many people think technology isnt educational, but it is because students uses online resource to lean new things. Other example why technology can be educational, students can learn new languages and that can help them in the future. Next example students will be able to use technology, to help them do a project and they can search up educated websites that would help them on their projects. Therefore technology doesnt have a bad effect on people because it could be used to help students for educational use purpose. Technology can help people be healthy any many ways. For example i use apps to make healthy food and healthy drinks. Next example people can search up the type of food they are eating, and look at how much calories they are consuming. final example people can download apps that can help them exercise, keeping their body in good shape, and consuming food that is good for their body.

452,1234,25BFA95D04DE,"Everysingal student has worked hard in school. Showing they can push hared without being praised, even if it takes a year or two. Praising a student every time they get a good grade or accomplish a small paper isnt fine. I believe working hard builds true self-esteem comes from achivment because it shows in the students hard work, they arent going to be stuck up or self centered, and they wont expect anything if they stopped getting praised. Although achieving your work and getting praised once in a while does feel good. When a student works hard it shows in their work and in their face. Many students have shown their best effort with out getting praised. The student should have to put their own interest if the student really wants to accomplish their work. If the student is getting praised all the time what are they really learning about hard work? They would think everysingal good thing I do comes with a prize. There are many students that are stuck up when they receive a good grade, those students have probably done good work but there could be a student that has worked the same but didnt get a good grade. There are some students that get their feeling hurt when they dont get a good grade and their class mate rub their grade in their face. Those self center students are closed minded, instead of helping the student out they hurt their feelings. Some student like to keep their grades to themselves. If a student gets praised all the time they will expect something in the end. The student wouldnt do it for themselves they would do it for the prize. They will not learn about real hard work, they would think every good thing comes with a prize. And thats not the case. Feeling good at the end and knowing the student has worked hard with no prasing is great. They feel better about themselvs because they know now they can achieve something without the prasing. In conclustion I believe true self-esteem comes form hard work, feeling good about your own grades and not expeting anything from anyone when you have worked really hard. The student will show their effort in their own work, and will look for their own achivments in school so they can feel good about themselvs. Thoes are the student that should be prasied.

Most of the parents, students, and the teachers like to see students graduate early in high school, and this programs are mostly in the U.S.A. Student who graduated early will have a lot of opportunity to finish school and have a better life, most summer school lesson can also help students to take less classes at school. It is a good idea for student to take only three classes in high school in order to graduate and go to college, back those days my mom use to tell me a story, about the opportunities we have in we that most people dont really care about. She used to tell me a story about her in high school, how hard it is to graduate, most people can take five to six years in order to graduate and go to college. And most people did- en make it to college, cause they dont have the money to pay and it really hard to find a job in Africa. Student drop out of school just because they dont have the opportunity we have right now to graduate in high school.

This mostly happened to people who have the opportunity to do the right things but decided to let it go, and my gran mother use to tell me a story. If you ready to help yourself, God will be ready to help you, if you not trying to help yourself, God will not going to help you. All this opportunity we have are all helpful in many ways, taking three years in high school is very help full for most of the students, reasons why graduation early in high school is better than waiting for four years are. first reason, the three years of high school helps student to graduate early and move on to the next level, helps student to finish school early and have a better life. Second reason, helps students learn faster and makes it easier for college, it also helps student to take less classes in high school. the last but not the least, summer school programs can help students understand better and easier than normal classes because, less distraction from other students and having opportunities to ask questions you dont understand. Student must take this programs very security, so you will be able to graduate early in high school or a small leak can sink a great ship.

Because he said he have to work because he dont have money for buy food and pay rent in the same time that is sad because he said i want to graduated but i cant because i havde to work for pay my rent and buy my thinks. and if schools have the program they can help him to do his gol.

To be productive or to do something productive really doesnt have to be school work related it can be anything like having a job, chores or helping around the community. Lets say you have home work but you dont feel like doing it, because your used to not doing anything and or are lazy to do it. which means you are more likely to procasanate.

458,1240,4D816E688FBD,"This Essay Is about:To conserve energy and resources do we have to extening the school day two hours, four-day school week? My opinion about this question is that we dont need to extend the school day and go to the school four-day a week. Why? Easy, because if the students spend more time in the school everday, we just loose energy. We get tired, we are not focus in class, we forget what we learned, affect your communication with your family. We get tired even now, that we just come for seven hours. If we spend more time in the school, the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are. Getting tired students start loosing they energy and, they do not pay attention what the teacher is saying. Sometimes I feel like I cant anymore my body and my mind need to take a rest. Your mind start loosing power when you get tired. Get tired and do not have a good rest is not healthy. we are not focus in class. When you start the day after a good rest, your mind start the day fresh. If your mind is fresh, you get better focus and powerful mind to think about what you are doing. During the day after few hours, you start getting tired and, loosing focus about what you are doing. If we spent more time in class, we gonna get bored and we can start talking with the neighbor, distract the others students and interrupt the class. After the school time students are gonna be so tired (body and mind) that they will want to arrive at home take a rest, leaving the homeworks without do it. We forget what we learned. It is so simple forget what we learned during the day, specially if we are going fast and talk about different topics. If we extend the school day, we most see different topics and we will going fast,forgeting about the last topic. This happend because we lose focus,when we are thinking in the differents process and topics. When your mind is process one information (lets say ""Math"") and, you do not even practice for a while, you just get it and, the teacher pass to the next unit (beacuse the period is longer cause the extending school day), you most will forget what you learned last unit. Affect your communication with your family. how extending the school day, affect your communication with your family? Well, lets say the most of the time you are in the school, some parents work during the day. But in the afternoon when the kid arrive at home parents spend time with them. If extending the school day, by the afternoon the students are gonna be more tired than normal they are and, they just will want to take a rest the rest of the afternoon. You have three days of weekend to do what ever you want and, have a conversation with your family? of course you have an extraday now, but remenber thats just for students your parents still working one more day. The weekend the students can use it for homeworks that mean you do not have much time to have a conversation or pass time with your falimily. My conclution is: If you gonna get tired, do not gonna be focus in class or you will forget what we learned, it is not a good idea to extend the school day, because at the end do not bring anyhelp for students. And can be worth for some of them. Take a good rest, be focus in class and keep what you learned, those are the students beneficts. The extratime I spent on my homeworks at home plus the school day, it is enough to learnd and be focus on study and get a fresh mind.",7,6,6,6,4,7,1010,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you dont know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home. My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home. Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did. my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids. Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid. My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home. I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home. summer: Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.,4,4,5,4,4,5,2412,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

As we growing up we been told how to be, and who we have to be like, but only people who resists and face worlds opinion can really know deeply what self-acceptation is. It is not about ego, it is about reallity. God, Universe or whowever gave us life, also gave us a purpose. Being different is not a crime, but a privilege, so we have to take advantage of it. Life has a lot of perspectives, just because they are right, does not mean I am wrong. Before my favorite artist passed away, he used to say: ""I rather to be hated for who I am, than be loved for who I am not."" well, I think Emerson would love this quote. People that choose a diferent direction are usually called: black sheep, weirdos, misfits, and even crazy. In most of the cases they end up being rejected, just because how they look, how they dress or how they think. but it is a fact that no long they become the most greatness, successfull and happiest people in the world, and there is a few of them. well, I guess no pain, no gain. I know is hard to be yourself when all these people are judging, in my opinion it is a really big accomplishment being yourself, even in these modern times. I never understood why we have to be like someone else just to be accepted in this cruel society but I know for fact that being myself is the best feeling Ive ever felt, so I trully believe that being yourself is more important than a life lacked of happiness.",7,6,6,7,6,7,267,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
461,1243,FF9469424ED0,"All schools have different educational activities, including playing an instrument. There are so many things you can do when you play an instrument. Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music. While playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that youre capable of playing music that others who arent able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. Its always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless. When being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools dont normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldnt want to go there. Every movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play. You can always search up the sheet music to any song you want to play. You can also make your own sheet music and play that yourself. You can play every song on an instrument. People enjoy playing the music theyve wanted to play since they first started playing an instrument. There are movies that people love and the people who can play an instrument are able to play that movies theme song. Not a single song cannot be put in sheet music so, if anyone ever wanted to play their favorite song they could search it up and it would pop up. Even though some songs are harder to make sheet music for theyre still possible to do. When playing an instrument, practice does make perfect. Nothing about playing an instrument is easy, but everything about it is fun. The effort put into playing your instrument does pay off at the end. Playing well can make you so happy and proud of yourself. Not only are you proud of yourself, but others are proud of you. Being able to play an instrument is a privilege that not everybody gets. There is nothing that can stop someone from becoming a part of the music community. The friends you can make and go with to the exciting field trips. Play all the music youve ever wanted to play. Everything you can do in band is limitless. ",7,7,9,7,8,8,3900,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
462,1244,E110443F5184,"""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""Therefore,in my opinion character traits can be chose but it must show as true self that represent you. Why, let me tell you; every on has their own unique traits even the traits they get from their parent. lastly animal spirit do show has traits that represent as our character traits. Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path. Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits cant be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parents traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my moms gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits. Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show. Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse. As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait. Therfore I always said ""Character trait can be beautiful but a curse in disguise"". Anyway not a problem. That I truly believe that everyone has the right to chose their own character traits then having someone influences them to have the same character trait as them then having your own traits.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3215,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

And is the pride of the family, and the world to see that you trying and trying for to be something better of life. I think is no hard to try anything for to be a better person in life. I always wish better accomplish to others persons in all world. Is like a example studying gave a good benefitsfor to be a better person. Is something that you try for to be pride of the world.

464,1246,7CB712FD1253,There are some some schools that offer 3 years to graduate but then there are some schools that are still doing Traditional ways of the 4 years of high school and in my opinion is that it is good to graduate early and go to college or the work force but it also depends on the person thats doing all this work to graduate high school or the evenings or night school but people still do it and its good. The people that are doing all this work are hard working people who want to follow through with there ideas and dreams in life and they are paying good for it by studying and working hard throughout high school and they keep on working hard to reach for there goal outside of high school. In my opinion Its a great idea to finish all of high school within 3 years because thats hard work paid off but some people believe that if you stay in school for an extra year that makes you smarter but in some sense that could be true but sometimes people stay the extra year because for 1 they sometimes stay because they fell behind and sometimes its because they need one type of class for college but in reality the people who did the 3 years of high school are the truly advanced ones because they did everything within 3 years and its good for them. if these people go into the work place they have a higher chance of getting the job that they want because they have a high school diploma and the fact that they graduated school early so they that as an advantage for them when they find a job and most jobs are only looking for people that are either in high school or have a diploma because some jobs just want people with brains so they could work smarter and not harder but the truth is these people are doing everything to make a living because they worked really hard in high school now theyre working really hard at a job and now they are succeeding in life because they were smart and graduated earlier then everyone else In the case that going to college after graduating the three years are also good because they want to get into a field of a type of job that they wanted and now theyre working even harder for it but in reality its working smarter not harder because they are studying for a career that will give them more money no matter what because they are studying for 4 more years to achieve there dream of becoming something in this world and they are smarter by doing that because a dream job is one of the things everyone wants and its good to have a goal in mind. In my conclusion is that going to college is the better one because Its working smarter not harder and thats the better idea instead of working hard and not being able to get paid enough like the people at the college do so in my state of fact that college if the better choice to go with out of high school no matter if you did 3 years or traditional 4 years of high school the best choice is after high school to go to a college or a university that makes life better in the end for everyone. Some people like to chose the route of hard work but its truly good to head to a college or university after school is over fo0r this person.,8,7,8,7,7,6,1642,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
465,1247,CFD0D13D3180,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill got the concept that ""success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."". Many people failed and successed in life. Some people learn by their own mistake, fail is part of growth. Others, feel like to fail is being a loser and cannot admit their defeat from a battle. In other words, they have no modesty. Success consist to not give up on your goals, to not leave your dreams from a simple mistake; to not describe yourself as a coward. Many people failed during their career, even the most professionals, but they kept trying. It may be that to fail bring some issues of closed minds, fears, etc. For example, There is a doctor that knows the hard work to finally done with college plus to achieve what youd love to be. This doctor studied for 7 years, this is a huge and long way of his career. As you know doctors never stop studying because the technology changes every year. Therefore, the start is not easy as, others, thought because the first stage of college, it may be the hardest stage than the others. Some people fail the first test, or the first semester so they prefer to abandon their studies than do better in college. This doctor have failed on the way of his career, but prefered to ask for help instance of giving up. The importance of failing is to learn and the importance of learning is to success in life. Above this, a 15 years old guy used to fail in High School and this student was down-hearted, but the family supported him without criticize him. It was not easy because some are not smart enough, but this 15 years old guy put a little bit of effort and now he is a doctor in Spain. Failure to faliure is the key of succes. Besides, Failure gives you more knowledge of your mistake and opens your mind to discover news to things to learn. For example, a cook is trying to do new dishes from differents cultures. Now, the cook wants to try peruvian dishes because the gastronomy of Peru is one of the most populars in the world. Also, this would be a benefit because will gain more money. By trying these new dishes, the cook fails because most of the customer did not like the food plus received many critical comments. As many cooks receives many critical comments, they decide to abandon the kitchen and do something different. This cook enjoyed when he commited a few or big error; to do better next time. Learned to do better the new peruvian dishes, listened to the rest of people and finally, succeded in the kitchen. Some feel ashamed to fail, they usually compare themselves to others because life is a competition and this may bring issues of insecurity. That is one of the biggest problems that many people have in these days. If there are 2 lawyers that wants to face a case of an innocent and important person, who is involved, in a serious problem. The best lawyer would defend the case and will be recognized as one of the best, would get inmmediatly many jobs for being recommended. On the other hand, if a lawyer fails a case would not get inmmediatly many cases often. Therefore, the lawyer knows that to fail have a positive side of learning, gives you more skills of how to face any case. In conclusion, as Churchill said that to fail is the start to success. As many people fail, they learn. Some people are not smart enough, but they put effort of what they want to do. Even though they fail, they keep trying because is the ability of their knowledge. People that are already professionals, they make mistakes and enjoy of their mistakes because they learn more of their speciality. Finally, even if you want to be the best of something, do not feel ashamed because life is a competition and do not closed your mind of making a few mistake.

467,1249,3FE7AF072783,"Soccer has always been the most important priority in my life. It is not just a game but a whole different world for of its own. In the other hand, education has been also an essential part of my life. Living in a world full of competitions and challenges needs so much of a persons will power and hard work then just having an outstanding goal and not working on it. Business is something devastatingly related to education and hard work but sports are also a type of business that most of the people do not observe it. Lionel Messi, the greatest soccer player of all time, is the person I mostly want to meet. I have always been fascinated by your skills and finishing in the field. Every teenager changes their goals for their future at least 5 times, but I have had this dream of being the greatest soccer player in the world since my first year in middle school. I can assure Messi that if he takes me to the Barcelonas beautiful stadium, I will do my best to show him how serious I am to be the greatest soccer player. I believe Messi can select me to show the true feeling of being the greatest soccer player and to let me see the most beautiful stadium of their team because soccer has always been the top priority in my life, it is not just a game but a whole different, beautiful, and unbelievable world for me, and soccer is the only game that I can play all my life without any regrets. It was the first year in middle school that I actually understood what soccer is. Since then I have been in love with soccer. I lived in Generic_City and my parents are Asian; that is why I have had quiet some obstacles during my life because any Asian parent wants their child to study, study, and study. I was always against those who thought that sports cannot be a true career and business. I never gave up; although my parents told me hundreds of times to work on your education and study hard, but I kept it all balanced and I didnt let my parents know that soccer was always the top priority in my life. Soccer teams and opportunities in our school is important, like working hard and getting into JV was really important for me, and I will surely work hard and do my best next year to get into varsity too. Some people believe that soccer is just a simple game which anyone can play when they have free time and have nothing to do. I totally disagree with that concept. I believe soccer has its own world. It can be a professional career and it can be a brilliant way to earn money for those who works to earn money. The first day I watched Messis video on YouTube had me surprised that how can a person be so magnificent at controlling, dribbling, passing, and shooting. He was just perfect. There are hundreds of soccer players out there who have unbelievable and outstanding skills like: Cristiano Ronaldo, Paul Pogba, Neymar Jr, Mbappe and so many more. Did it ever happen to you that you have played for hours and hours and your mom calls you to come home saying, ""it is enough"", but you feel like you had just started playing 10 minutes ago and how did the time went so fast? It is always the feeling I have when I play soccer. I never get tired mentally while I do get tired physically after 3 hours of playing. I want to play more and more and that feeling never gets old. That feeling shows how much you love the action you are doing. Money is one of the most crucial thing to survive in this world but if I had to choose between never ending amount of money in my bank account and freedom to play as much soccer as possible, I would gladly choose soccer. Most of the time my imaginations are so nice that I just do not want to move and ruin it because all I imagine is me playing in professional soccer game and millions of people being my fan and I have all the skills that I wanted to have. Imaginations are nice but in real world we have to work real hard and with passion to achieve our goals. Although most of the people believe that soccer must stay as a game that anybody can play in their free time, but I completely disagree because soccer is a complete professional career for anyone who wants to play. Anybody in this world can be the greatest soccer player but the key is to work hard and challenge yourself every single day to become better.

468,1250,F6AA88DC9ACA,"Although it may seen that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" it actually right. But having something that you master it doesnt mean that trying something new you would failed. But giving up its what would cost you to never grow, for example changing your life style by eating right and going to the gym is not going to be easy but you still going to give it a try. The reason why is that we want to challenge our self in a new environment that we never thought our self would be challenge our self in. Another reason would be that trying something new mean that we are looking for something that we would enjoy or like. For example we teach our self how to cook but we know that we never knew how to cook but that doesnt mean we are not going to give it a try. That why we try new things because we want to challenge our self in a situation that we never knew that we could solve it or give up. Another reason is that we love trying new things because we are curious if we can master it another example would be is raising a kid wondering if we got everything and teaching them what is right and what is wrong. That what we love trying new things to see if we can do it or not. That what is more important trying new things and see if we can master it because we are capable of doing thing not a computer cant do and that it trying to learn new things. We can master anything in our way because we are willing to find out if we can do this, if can not fear it, if we got this, give our self ideas that anything we do it possible when we put our mind it nothing cant stop us. For example we got our freedom from England long time ago, we ended slaves, and we ended racism which was big in the United State. Those are the reason why we can master things even if they are hard to master but we do it for a reason, and the reason is that we love to try new things even is bad but every challenge we are giving, we master them. But there is no dough we would failed those challenge that the world has giving us. Mastering is a challenge that is difficult because there is in our lifetime were we give up and we dont want it anymore. Were our mind and our body just doesnt want it, doesnt keep trying, at some point we start calling our selves looser, quitter. We bring ourselves down because that how we punish ourselves without physical pain but emotion pain. In our life time that we have live in this earth the most pain that brought us down was emotional pain when we give up in life and we havent master it. That is the big challenge that we havent try to complete because it has beating us since the beginning that we are born we havent control our emotion and that is the challenge that we havent master it. For that we have issues that we arent able to figure it out because its hard for us to figure what make us mad ,sad, happy, but people who has master it because they did give it a try and they successfully master that does emotions that give us hard time in life. Those people are therapy who want to understand does type emotion because they want to help those people who doesnt understand why they react like that. That what make us to try new things in life because we are curious about what interest us as human being and see if can master it so ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered keep trying new thing that you would be able to do and get your attention to it "".",6,5,5,5,4,6,3681,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

470,1252,BA9DA5122C58,"I think that we should have after school homework clubs in school because it can really help kids get homework done at the right time so they dont get a zero on their homework. There is kids that get too much homework so homework club would be a good time for them to get their work done so fast that they dont need to worry about it when they get home. Some kids might struggle in one class because they have a lot of assignments that they need to make up. Homework club will give students plenty of time to get missing work done, and they should move the grade up to an A or B. You could also get homework from a bunch of different classes, and homework club will give them enough time to get the easy assignments done, so that they can focus on getting a hard assignment done, and that would leave the students with one assignment left to do. Homework club can be seen as a way to spend your time wisely when it comes to getting homework done. It reduces the stress of getting too much homework because students will realize how much time that they have to get their work done so they can focus on the activities that they do in or outside of school. For example, someone might have soccer practice at 5:30, and homework club might be from 2:30 to 4:50. That would give a student enough time to get a lot of work done before soccer practice. Its better to finish homework early because you would not need to worry about it for the rest of the week. Sometimes kids need assistance from teachers because they are struggling to understand the subject, and they may need a teachers help. The could stay at homework club so students can work with the teacher to get the work done. A student might leave an assignment at the last minute because they had other assignments to do. If homework club will give a student two hours in a half to do their assignment, they should be able to get their work done just in time. Homework club can give relief to a student when they have left an assignment at the last minute. I believe that if a lot of kids went to homework club, then all students will be successful. That would mean that kids will get As and Bs from now on, and they would not need to stress about their grades. It just takes students to use their time wisely at homework club to get homework done, and no one will have any problems.

I disagree with Albert Schweitzer because he said, Example is not the main thing in influencing others ; it is the only thing. First reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence people. For example, I go to a party and there are people under the age of twenty-one drinking alcohol, they do not have to be someone I know for them to influence me to drink alcohol. Some people would feel pressure to do it just because the other ones are doing it. Second reason why I think an example is not the only way to influence others. The tv can influence people to buy thing from the commercials, it could be anything. People sometimes do not think about how much money they spend on stuff; at the and of day they use it once, and then forget about it. On the other hand, people think that the only way to influence someone is by an example.

475,1257,DCE82F61BE10,"Is good idea for students to recive online courses. In my point of veiw, it will be better for students to attend to regulars classes at schools. In this way students will be able to socialize with other people. Also, they will have the opportunity to do other activities. In this days sudents recive free education and it is easy for them to attend to school. Online programs may have a cost for the courses or classes. if students attend to schools they will learnd more about their classes because teachers will be able to teach them with enthusiasm. In the other hand, is good idea to recive classes online but you will not have the opportunity to interac with teachers or other students. If you go to school there will be a way that you can make new friends that you can share adventures and stories with them. It will be more benefit for students who go to school than students who stay at home watching their scream on the computer. Attening school also give you the option to enroll many activies. For example, you can join the football team. music band, and the theater shows. I know a friend that he didnt like to attend school, but when he start to play for the football team at his local school, he was more exiting to speen time at school. At school you can do many actiivities. In contrast, reciving classes online can be a good option for does students that dont have the resources to go to school. For example, if they dont have a bus stop or the school is to far away. Also, for the students with special disability. The united states have the advantage to have free education. This is a good thing for does parents with not reasourses. Parents can send students to school without worry for a monthly payment. They know that their children are in a good learning place. In the other hand, having classes online may cost a amount of your money. It will be difficult for students because they will have to find a job to soport their online paymants for the courses. In this way have classes online is not a better option for all. Offering distance learning as an opion for students is not a good advantage for all the people who want to study. its because many students prefer to attend to school than staying at home.

476,1258,67E711AF87A2,"Are you done trying to reach your goal in life? Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is right. If you have accomplished somthing in life but you are not where you want to be then go for more. Keep trying to go beyond from what you have already masterd. It puts your self out their, and lets people know you want more then what you already have. You will defenetly grow if you keep trying. In the process of trying to master things in life it will be important for professionalism,money,and being successful. Having professionalism in you takes a lot of work and time. For example, Cristiano Ronaldo is a profesional sorccer player, he was once a starter in soccer. Of coures it took time and hard work and lots of practice to get to where hes at. Another example when i stared playing soccer i was 4 and it was really hard, it was hard to kick a ball or to keep up with the ball, but i went to the feild with my freinds every day and i wanted to be really good so i did not give up. I nocticed my self growing a lot and now i play for a really good soccer team and planning on going to a good soccer collage. However Jobs is something that takes time and hard work. If you work hard at a job and show people that you are good at it, it can get you a better jobs in the future. Money dose not come to you for free you must do something for it for example, when i was 12 years old i was to young to get a job so i would go next door and ask if i can mow thier lawn or if they had any jods for me. When you are trying to reach a goal in life and you are growing big time more money gets involved, which is a really good thing. If your boss sees you doing really good at your job your boss can give you a raise or make you be assistant manager because they notice that you are growing and that you want to master more. The more you grow the more better youll get. When you made it to where you want to be, you were seccessfull. you tried your hardest and did as much as you can to get to the top. To be seccessfull you need to study a lot try to listen and watch a lot. when you are growing you make mistakes which is fine it happends to a lot of people. You will learn from your mistakes and lessions. For example when i was 5 years old and i was at my soccer game i accidently scorded on my own team and it never ended up happening again cause i learned from my mistakes. Some may say if you dont go beyond from what you have accomplished, you will still grow. They are wrong because the more further you go to accomplish things will make you grow more and it wil help you reach more goals in anything. Always try to do more then what you have already done. Dont let anyone stop you. You will not grow if you dont go beyond from where you are at. Its good to do anything it takes to master something in life. There are lots of ansers and help everywhere to grow. ",6,6,5,7,6,5,1349,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
477,1259,5EFF1BA0FBC1,"Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people dont wanna stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work. I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add a after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barley have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework,or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day .And they will probably be grumpy or stressed. My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we wont get to learn anything. And dont forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work. So i think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like peoples sleep schedule,The time they might go somewhere. So over all i think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects,and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced. But if they did change it then we would have to get used to changing our sleep time and doing school work.",8,7,7,7,8,8,1225,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Also some students might change that career because they want the best for them selves and its not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one thats doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person and it doesnt matter how much money your making its STILL MONEY!!!! and some people around the world still dont get that.

After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate theyll go to a University, and I gotta tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life.

Another example, some students are really quiet and they are shy to talk to people so they work alone so they dont need to be behind everyone else who isnt doing there work. Students often dont really get a lot of help from other students when they work in groups. Often some kids make the mistake on joining groups but then when it comes to doing work only 2 students do the work and then the other 2 dont do anything. Students sometimes dont even do anything they just sit around and talk to there friends about other things then they talk about the work they need get done or there on the phone or playing games. For example some students dont like doing anything they just like to sit around and talk but on the other hand they are students that like doing there work so its best to see that students like working alone then to be working in groups. In some cases some students dont let them talk to there friends because they think they are gonna make there child fail that class and some parents are gonna blame the friends then there own children. For example if a parent gets a phone call from a teacher saying oh your student is failing my class because there not doing there work like they used to before the parent is gonna feel bad because there gonna think oh my child is hanging out with kids there not supposed to be with. In my opinion I think its best for students to work alone then to be working in group. Sometimes in life we want everything but sometimes we have to earn them all by ourselves not with someones help but our own help.",6,7,6,7,7,7,2082,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
487,1269,E36B406AFE70,"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but its actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest. While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed On weekends, when im at home and im lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think hes doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time. When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or ill be caught in a family emergency. Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isnt always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if im idle.",8,7,8,8,9,7,3275,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
488,1270,71129FE0D18F,"Some schools districts allow students to graduate within three years. This is a good idea because of legal statuses, not having financial support, and also some students having almost all required credits. One reason is my friend Generic_Name. My friend Generic_Name lives in Texas he is going to graduate with the class of 2020. Due to his moms immigration statutes they left Virginia to go to Texas in the summer of 2019 to seek for help. In fear that his mother would be deported in less than a year he decided he would finish a year earlier than what was expected. This year Generic_Name is taking high level class while still being ahead of the game. Another reason is some students have no financial support. Some students want to go into the work force but do not want to effect their academics. Graduating early would be a great solution for them. Even some want to join the work force to earn money for college or help their families financial problems. Lastly some students have almost all credits to graduate due to taking high school classes at an earlier level. For a standard diploma in the state of Virginia you need 3 math, 3 science,4 history, 4 English, health grade 9 and 10, 2 sequential fine art, and a language. Due to some students taking some classes at earlier levels it dulls it all down for them in high school. Graduating within three years is a good idea it helps students end up with their high school diploma while also helping there problem. I agree that gradating within three years is a good idea for students who need and choose it. ",9,8,8,9,9,8,1465,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
489,1271,E0E060143B79,"Do you think failure lead you to do better? In this paper i will argue about never losing enthusiasm by falling and falling. Failure should be just another way to do better, because you try until you get it right, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. Also, enthusiasm and try is the key to success. First of all, when you try until you get it right, sometimes you get really frustrated. For example; in freshman year i remember that i couldnt actually get good grades in my algebra class, i remember that i try and try my harder to get good grades. I even stayed after school, I was doing my homework, i was watching videos from my teacher. However, i was still getting bad grades in my class but i keep trying and i finally become a success in the class. Secondly, when you fail; failure lead you to success in life. When you are working on a project or you are working on a personal goal sometimes thing doesnt actually goes the way you had planted. For example; if you are trying to solve a mathematics problem but you never get the solution youre supposed to get. Although, you keep trying and you always fail, you actually learning from it. However, by keep trying your best you actually getting experience from your failure and that helps you to success later in life. Finally, enthusiasm and trying is the key to success. For example; when you want to achieve something but you fail, each time youre losing enthusiasm because you think that you can not do it, but if you keep trying and trying their will be a time that you will going to success and you would said that you try your best and never lost enthusiasm for your goal. In conclusion, some people said that failure doesnt lead you to success, but they wrong because the more you fail, the more you try, and when you get it right, it will be a completely success for you. Going failure to failure led you to a good way to do better in life because the harder you try the better you do to success. In the future never stop trying without losing enthusiasm because enthusiasm is the key of your success.",6,7,8,8,7,7,3210,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
490,1272,D537BE6997F7,"I agree with success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because everyone need to be stronger, successful, and become independent youself. Success are things that everybody need to be stronger the most they can with every single thing in your life because everyone has bad moments in lifes and there are many peoples that they want to see them fail in everything. For example, if someone is given in they can find someone who is bad person and the only thing that they do is to given words that did not help in anything, but thats why they have to failure, but do not have to loss enthusiasm because if you loss enthusiasm you are failed in everything because in lifes you can find peoples that want to help you a lot, but sometimes you are going to find good peoples that want to help you in everything. Therefore, it does not matter what other peoples want to tell you people just have to continue their lifes and do not have to give up in anything, it does not matter peoples have to do everything they can because if you propose what you want you can do it no one is going to said no. Success is that everyone has to be successful in lifes because everybody has to be esthusiasm in everything. You do not have to loss that because you have to be with good smile because it does not matter what is happened in your life you must have to had a good smile in everything because it does not matter how many times in your lifes you are falling you have to continue because if you do not do a good job, thinking that you can not do what you want, or said that you are going give up in everything. For example, if your sister said that some people said that she can not make her dream true you can talk with her with enthusiasm and said that she can do everything she can propose because she do not have to listen those peoples that can not want their lifes good they failature is her past that means that others peoples are going to do the same thing because in this lifes exist peoples that want the bad thing to you that ever can exist. Success something in life is more harder than you think because you have to pass a lot of thing in your life and you have to stay strong the more you can because if one day you are going to fail in something and there is no one to give you support and you can not anymore, but you have to said in your mind that it does not matter because you are thinking in your mind that you are never give up with anything because you have your mind with power, esthusiasm, and stronger. However, you do not have to be thinking bad things there are some times that you failure with many things that can be in the school, work, or test. You always have to be in mind that it does not matter how many times you took your test and get bad grades you have to do it until you get good grade or how many days you are going to take to learn any kind of food the thing is the you have to be a good person to show to other peoples that you can do whatever you want to show to the world that you can do everything you want because they are here to fail, but if you lose a lot of time you are going to wake up twice. Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because in this world everyone is here to be something in their life to be someone stronger to make your skills stronger to show to the peoples that you want to be someone with energy to show that there are so many things that you want to do be a successful person to help peoples when they need something; it does not matter what you are passing or what your life is give you. You just have to learn how to be a good person, how you can make your skills stronger, and how you can demostrated to yourself what you can do and can not do because that is a harder to know yourself to see what you can do or not because you can see more peoples that if they can not do anything they do not tried anymore they are sad, mad, or angry with their self because they can not do what they wanted. For example, if your friend want to be in the future a teacher and he/she has to learn, to be prepared, and study. He may not want all of that or he/she may have travel with all of those things he/she is going to get mad with herself, sad with herself, angry with herself and he/she is going to said no i can not with all of this is so harder that i think, but everyone has to be stronger show that you do not have to get mad to show with enthusiasm that does not matter how many times you may fail you have to learn, study, be prepared everything you need and you will see that you can everything you want. In conclusion, Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm because you have to be stronger, successful, and become independent yourself because you have to be stronger with any problem in your life, stronger with every person, and stronger with whatever you have to do. You have to be successful with yourself, with your work, and with your own things. You have to be independent with yourself because when you are older or you are lonely you have to see for your owns things, you have to fight for you owns problems, and for your owns bussiness. For example, if you are going to be a good police you have to see what is coming what your enthusiasm is going to be what you have to be. You have to fail many things, but you have to tried the most you can because is this life everything you do have to be with enthusiasm. Therefore, If you find a job and you boss said that you have to go to do a fish and you went, but you did it wrong and he said this is wrong you failure you have to tried again you have to go with enthusiasm not be angry or sad because you are going to do that with enthusiasm to said im going to do this rigth not wrong because everything you do with enthusiasm everything you will get more better and you will be happy because if you do everything good you are going to feel thatyou do a esthusiasm and good work.",6,5,6,5,5,7,2968,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
491,1273,DDCB2CC96EA7,"I am strongly agree the failures in our lifes means to keep going and be a successful person. Although some say success not consists of going from failure because people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes, actually success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes and get experiences to teach other people. Those who believe success not consists of going from failure have they reasons. One reason people always fell many times keeping doing the same mistakes in several times in their lifes. But doing the same mistakes many times does not help people to be successful; makes the person wake in front of others. People that are better to them can make bullying at them because they feel that they are perfect than others .Many of the people that keep thinking that they are a loser think about diying is the better thing to get out of the failures. Did you know is that 90% 0f the teenagers kill them self instated of find help to keep going with their lifes. It is very scary and make me sad at the same time. If we use social medias we can see people talking about their lifes or using drugs and drugs makes the person to lose more their mind. However, success consists of going from failure because failure help us to learn more in our lifes. Learning from failure to failure is better for all the people. Having the enthusiasm in our mind can be the better word to start our life every day. We are capable of doing many things it does not matter how many times we have to do the same things to be better in our feature but we have to keep going not matter what. In my position I have a experience; when I was in my country I did not what to do with my life; I just was trying to finish my middle school, get a job and then have a family and now here I am making better things for my life; now I am tinking about to have a better life. when I came to USA I was tinking about how am I going to do if I do not nothing about the language but now I feel more conformist knowing the language because makes me keep going studying. I though that learning another language was a new obstacle for me to keep going we my life. Also, success consists of going from failure because people get experiences to teach people. There are many people that think that they are failure and they are not; I think that every people are genius. The things is that people don not let the talents get out and that can be because they think about others people opinions about them. I have many experiences keep seeing people about failure. Had you ever try to help others? I have it done many times. When I was in my country I saw this person trying to be better but at the same time this person was with many problems that did not let to keep going. In many occasion I help the person to be better like getting solutions with the problems and it is very difficul to teach others with the problems and try to make them better. Seeing our life in a failure can be the worst thing, but keeping trying to do better things each day is going to be the better effort in our life and that is going to help us to get more enthusiastic every day. It is very helpful to find ways to be better in the world because every person had to have new things to do the life better for themselves and help others if they are struggling with their life.

493,1275,EDFFA0E4D88C,"Should school weeks consist on four days with days of 10 hours of school ? on my opinion there is no point on doing that, people that work is going to miss hours at work because of this, students are going to use that extra day to not study and be home doing nothing, and people instead of using electronics at school are going to use them more at home. Some students work after school, they need time to go home and get ready for work and with school days being longer it would be pointless to work, you will be making 3 or 4 hours a day, some students,specially on senior year, need to pay bills or make money for the future to pay college. on my opinion the best thing to do is to keep the regular five days at school, and to keep working at least six hours a day. Teachers and staff members are thinking that students are going home and they will do their homework or study, but what they dont think is that some people need help with school work, or they feel more comfortable studying at school, now with that less day they will be more students failing projects and exams, for example if a students used to study at the library after school he is not going to be able because it is going to be late by the time he gets out of school, they should keep the normal schedule for all the students that are getting benefits from it People wants to save energy and money by taking away a day of school, but they dont think that students will be going home to use their cellphones, watch TV, play video games, and a lot of more things that consume energy, if they stay at school they are not going to be able to use their cellphones or any other electronic device, they will just use it during breaks and lunch, so that is less time than being home a whole extra day. For all this reasons a think that it would be better for students to keep with the regular schedule and keep coming to school everyday, for the regular hours, in that case they will not miss any hours at work, they will have more time to study and to do homework at school, and they will not use their electronic devices as much as they would at home, even though the idea of saving money and electricity its such a good idea some students dont understand that and they will not do it at home.",8,7,8,8,8,8,3482,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

For example Churhcill says that ""success consists of going from failiure to faliure without loss of enthusiasm"". I agree with him. I believe that to have success in life you have to go through failiure. Failing with the same feelings and mindset is hard but you just have to think failing is a way of getting better. Failiure is also not something you should be afraid of or embarressed of. You should be proud of failing cuz you know what you did wrong and next time make it twice as strong. Failing does not mean that your to dumb to do whatever it is. It just means you need some more time. Churchill bleieves that failure has an important role in the pursuit of success. Which I also believe this becuase once you fall all you want to do is get right back up. Which I encourage everyone to do. When you fall get back up everyone falls. Life is about taking risks and failing. Which in my opinion evryone should do. Failiure is the key to success. Without failing you cant really call it success. I beleive you can only succeed in something that you have failed at. Without failing life would be boring and everything would be the same because people are taking riks we have lots of different things in the world today. Everyone has failed to do something. Not everyone in the world is perfect. I wrote this to persuade my readers to take risks. It is also fine to fail just get up and try again. Surely, if Churchill was a live today her would be spreading the same message around the world. That without failiure there is no success. Also, that everyone has failed at something, nobodies perfect. Churchill Is trying to say that faliure turns in to success. Once you fail you know what you have to do to get yourself back up. Then you try again and again until you get something you are happy with. This is what makes you try again. This is what makes you find and fix your problems. You get a lot out of failing thats why i think that anyone that is going through something tough dont give up so easily becuase its is ok to fail. Failing is a good thing not a bad.

498,1280,9FE2FE6E997E,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile. Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate. Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality. In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure. It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life.",8,6,8,6,6,7,2140,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
499,1281,349FF2E7D179,"Although, setting a good example by your behavior is helpful to others, there are other ways to set a good example. Talking to people and persuading them to do good is influential, you can save someones life by talking to them, you can help someone be successful by talking to them and influencing them to do good helping them take the right path to becoming successful, seeing someone fail knowing you couldve spoke to them and influenced them on the right path would suck; I personally would feel horrible, sometimes all it takes is a couple words to influence someone. People dont always pay attention to your actions, people pay attention when their spoken to, when you talk to someone one on one its so much easier to get their attention rather than you behaving good in class for example. Actions can determine the way you change someones decisions, the way you behave can set a good example to other people but ask yourself would you rather have someone talk to you or you go off based on how someone else behaves? Confidence in yourself is also a good way to influence people, you need to be confident in what youre going to say to the other person, you need to be assured of what youre going to say to them. In order for you to be confident you need to genuinely know that person in order to find ways to influence them. Once you talk to them and get to know them better you can go ahead and influence someone, it isnt always how you behave there are plenty of ways you can influence someone. Confidence in yourself is important because once youre confident everything will go smoothly, find out what the person likes and dislikes once you have that in hand youre good to go. Honesty plays a big part when it comes to influencing someone, why? When you speak with honesty you wont hesitate in what youre talking about, you wont feel guilty of lying because youre speaking the truth. Respect is also something you should when influencing someone, when you show someone respect the connection of the dialogue increases and the other person will be interested in talking to you. Determination into influencing someone is probably the most important thing, when youre determined into doing something its because you really want to do it, nothing is stopping you from doing what youre determined to do. When youre determined into influencing someone you feel secure in what youre doing, thats when confidence kicks in determination and confidence are somewhat alike, determination is when youve decided to do something and theres no turning back, once you feel determined influencing someone will be easy, especially if you know the person well. Decision making on yourself is important too, you cant go off influencing people to do wrong you need to do a self check and ask yourself if youre ready to influence people, you have to ask yourself do my actions match what I say, when influencing someone you want to influence them to do good not bad. Preparation, you have to prepare yourself before going off to influence other people, why? Because you cant go off influencing people if youre not prepared to do so, do research on how to positively influence people, practice it with friends and family. Influencing people isnt easy, it takes a lot of practice, determination, confidence, respect and just getting to know the person well, once you have all those qualities youre able to go off and influence people that need help, people that need someone to talk them through, there are people out there that rather have someone talk to them and influence them on the right path rather than watching how other people behave. Behavior isnt the only thing the only thing you can do to influence someone, to influence someone you need to be prepared, you need to have confidence in yourself before going and trying to convince people to do things how you tell them to because sometimes we feel like were right but we never take the time and think if were wrong or go back and see what you can improve in. Make sure youre on the right path so you can ahead and help someone else take the right path with you. Go ahead and influence someone just remember that your behavior isnt the only thing that people look at, people look at your qualities and how you approach them, make sure you do everything correctly and youll be set.

501,1283,69FD256DCE38,"There is a quote about success contsists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. people have different opinion about failure, some say failure is the worst thing that can happen to you, and it makes you not want to try your best on something . however in my opinion, I thing failure is the best thing that can happened to us humans because. it gives us the the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it, it makes us humans learn from our mistakes, and it gives us the strenth First failure gives us the corrage to try something over and over until you gat it because, I have fail before when I was trying out for the school soccer team, I work so hard for it I go to training everytime, and be there on time but i did not made the team I was so sad that i did not made the team but it give me the corrage to try more and more. Second failure makes us humans learn from our mistakes. we humans are not parfect we all make mistake and learn for it. it like me I am a teenager who cant speak english everwell, whenever I spoke to someone my age thay kept on making fun of me, but I never give up on myseif I know that if I learn from my mistakes I will be better at speaking english. Finally failure make us stronger. in life in other to get what we want we have to go throught failure it teach us to be strong and to nevergive up on yourseif. everyone go through failure for example president Donold Trump in other to be a president he has to go through som failure. In conclusion failure is the best thing that can happend to us humans. it teach us to be strong in anything that we want and to learn from our mistakes. failure play a enthusiasm in our lives that makes the world a better place.

502,1284,F84E5DEFC874,"Have you ever just sat down and thought, Do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Some say sayings have a reason for example Thomas Jefferson wrote ""Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"", Does this mean it is true because he said it? Or is it just something he wrote because it was his opinion? I strongly agree with what Thomas Jefferson wrote, its saying in little words dont be lazy, its amazing how much can get done if we are always doing something. If we are always doing something other than what we want to accomplish it takes time and the process just gets longer. I believe that inactivity serves a purpose even though your inactive or active some or many things can be accomplished. One reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, more can be accomplished when you are not active and working. I have experienced this numerous of times at my job. At my job, we have task we have to get done by a certain time which is closing and sometimes those task dont get done due to how busy the store gets, when the store gets busy we cant get what we want accomplished, but say we are not active, or working and the place gets slow and calm. We have the time to get our task done and meet the requirements and leaving on time. When you are super active and busy it get hectic and that just adds more to your tasks. For example your making some food, drinks and theres more and more orders, you cant make something then clean your gonna have to keep going and clean it all up at the end when it slows down. In my opinion you get what you want accomplished when your less active in this case. Another reason I believe that inactivity serves a purpose is because, when your not active you dont know what your gonna accomplish that day, but out of boredom your gonna get something out of it. This happens to me all the time where one day im just free all day with absolutely nothing to do, and i just lay in bed with a mess in my room not even thinking about the mess and all of a sudden I start cleaning everything and organizing everything. Like Thomas Jefferson says ""Determine never to be lazy... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something"" In this case it works both ways because if your doing something you get something accomplished and something good out of it, but if your doing absolutely nothing then you get nothing accomplished. Lastly I believe that inactivity serves a purpose because, say your going to try out for the boys or girls soccer team and there is only 1 spot left. Obviously your going to need to practice everyday and know how to play. Practice makes perfect the more active you are with soccer, the more chances your gonna get that last spot to be a member of the soccer team, but say you really want the last spot but your just not as good as the others and its a new sport you just wanna try out but you are not practicing everyday to get better. If you dont practice everyday to get better then there are less chances of you making that last spot just because you werent as active and on it like the others. The more practice you receive the more chances you will have to get that last spot because of the dedication with no activity done theres no hope in that. In conclusion, inactive or active you get through your day and learn something new and that is a accomplishment so much can be done in many different situations, anything is possible. At one point through your day you accomplish making it through even if you felt like you didnt accomplish anything you must have, because you learn something new that is the biggest accomplishment. Thomas Jefferson said that for a reason for sure. Everything has a meaning and reason behind it. ",6,7,7,7,6,8,3722,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
503,1285,144671E445D0,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote ""Do you think that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control?"". Well some people believes we choose our own character traits or influences by our control. Other people doesnt agree that we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control. I think that we choose our character traits, or our character is formed by influences beyond our control because were doing things that maybe enjoy doing, or we get to choose what we want to be. And I am going to talk about this and why I agree on this. I Agree that we get to choose our character traits or formed by influences beyond our control because you get to do anything when it comes to you becoming what you wanna be. Another reason is that no one can control you on how you should be later on in the future. I also think that doing the things you like to do would change you for example, helping people that are in need will make you a better person because youre controlling yourself on what you are doing. Another example is that if youre doing bad things, it would make you a bad person because of your actions. Thats why people think we change our character traits by choosing our own or formed by influences from our controls. Other people doesnt agree that we can change our own character traits or formed by influences from our controls because they think it cannot change their own character traits from the actions they do. Also many doesnt believe that doing what they wanna do wont change them later on in the future. Another reason is because they dont believe that we cannot choose our own character traits and that it should only be 1 trait about yourself. For example doing something positive wouldnt effect them because they can easily change and do something negative later in the future. Last thing is that they dont think we get to choose our own traits and basically say that we are born the way we are without changing our character traits. This makes me think if people who doest believe that they can change their character traits or controlling their influences can be a bad thing for them. the reason why i think its a bad thing is because they dont think they cant change the way they act with actions they do normally. For example, they think doing positive actions would not change their character traits. Changing your character traits can make you a better person because of the positivity you are spreading. if you spread positivity or have a good mindset could change your character traits. So in this essay i believe that people can change their character traits or formed by influences beyond our control. I say this because you can choose what you wanna be or act later on in life. Another reason is any actions people can do also makes them change their character traits. This is very good if you treat others with respect; you will be a positive person. This will also help you in life because if you think down you wouldnt be motivated, but you can change that by doing something nice to yourself or to someone. That will give you a good mindset and want to do it more often if it helps you feel motivated by making someones day .",5,6,6,4,5,5,278,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
504,1286,82722CEBCAB3,"When the entire class need to make a project in groups, but your group work more than the rest of the class do you think its fair if the teacher give a praising to the entire class? When I think about praising student work, I think in: hard work, effort, patience, and a consistent student. I agree with the self-esteem come from praise. Also praising students help to built self-steam, but you only can praising when the student make your best effort. For example; one student go to the bed at three in the morning and sleep only three hours making his project and checking all the project make sure is complete, but other student go to the bed at nine and sleep all night and dont worry about his project. Some students are more lazy than the others. The best decision the teacher can make is recognize the student who really make the best work and effort. However, some people believe that praise given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. The teacher recognize students work maybe work more hard in the next project or homework. If the teacher built a self-esteem praising students must be self-confident in order to learn. They believe teachers need recognize all students work not only some students. In conclusion the teachers only need recognize students work when the students really make a good work, best effort and this way the teachers can help to built self-esteem and motivate the student work hard in all the classes, projects, and homework. Students with a high self-esteem are the students who make a lot things is this world. Many times the students with high self-esteem are the students who go to the university, because they know are good in something; this is the reason because we have today doctors, lawyers, teachers, other professional people.",8,6,8,6,7,6,1720,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Most find it very very important if you want to succeed in life and make great money. on the other hand some many not and find it important and waste of time. I think everyone who doesnt find it important should really think twice. Yes I understand that some classes are better than others, but its all required for one to graduate. In my opinion i support both sides of the story. Some people want to start their life early some do not. Even if you wanted to graduate early its a challenge. obvious you would have to take extra classes, and to make those up you have a choice to take it during the summer, online, or night school which ever is best. its nice to graduate early because if one goes to college they see that and they think best of you. On the other hand i do not think its a good a idea to graduate early. Only if you have the right skills and capability for it. Gradating early is not for everyone some struggle in the normal four standard years of high school. It is not a requirement at all. High school is not a race its preparing you for your future its good to take all the time you need maybe if need to stay in extra year or two. In conclusion like I said ""I support both sides"" it is not necessary to graduate nor is it a requirement. Graduating early is only for those who already want to go to college or go into the work force. Graduating in the normal four years is grate if you dont know what your going to be yet after high school. There is never no rush. Always take your time its your future.

Have you ever wounder why that is the case?, if you are a person who does not take advice from another individual , then you could use this skill, taking advice from another person can help you make better life choices, it will make you understand things more clearly and faster, and learn from them. Multiple opinions really is a foundation to a job like a mayor of a city, it is vital to take advice from the community in order to address problems and concerns. If it was just a city with no voice in the community then the city would fall into a bad place which no one wants to be in and the key advice is to receive it. In the world we live in, we make a lot of important choices in life, some are big and some are small, but they effect our future and success. Next, advice from others can make you more wiser when you make your own choices, if Abraham Lincoln never saw how African Americans were treated for there skin color he would have never signed the documents for slavery to be band. if he never got advice he mostly likely would have never Andres the problems with having that toxic racism. If it wasnt for him, it would still be here today thanks to out 16th President, which boils down to good thinking and advice. At some point in our lives I know we got advice from someone we look up too,also what ever the advice they gave you, is an add on to bigger things, for example if a parent or guardian gives you some advice to never quit on things or problems that are hard and difficult for you, with just that you will Carey that for the rest of your life. Which eventually make you more wiser and resistant to challenges and in life. You will have a mindset that will help you be more successful and a hard worker. When you are at that point you will know what is right and wrong, from advice from your remodel, father, and mother. Multiple opinions is like trying different types of food from different chefs and if you just try it, you will see something you might like, if you never try something you will never see a different possibility taking advice is just like that.

510,1292,1928846BB272,"I believe that is good idea for the students to commit to a career at a young age. Instead, it is important for the students to find the specific career and graduate before time. In point of view, some students can choose, if they want to a specific career or more. In thesis statement, students can find the specific career because is great opportunity and good idea. First reason, some students are considered to find the specific career. Because they want to enter to the college at their young age. For example, Generic_Name was prepare to enter to the college at her 17th years old and she win a scholarship, and enter to Generic_School to study her specific career. This shows that students can achieve their goals at their young age, that nothing is impossible. Second reason, some students have to find the specific career. Because they want to prepare before graduate of high school. For example, Generic_Name had her classes pass and all the credits before 12th grade and she apply to the college to her specific career. Being students its not easy to achieve this specific goal, but with work hard and perseverance all is possible. Third reason, some students think that they cant commit to a career at a young age. Because they dont have courses to guide toward a specific career. For example, Generic_Name is in 12th grade and she wants to graduate before, but she dont pass her SOL and she have the enough credits for graduate. So this shows that students cant commit to a career. If they dont have everything that is necessarily to find the specific so they cannot achieve anything. In conclusion, it is important for the students to find a specific career at a young age. However, it is a great idea to find the career that proponent to achieve before the time of graduate and get all that you need like: credits, grades, exams, and courses. Also, this is a great opportunity if you want to be someone professional in this society. So be positive and perseverant.

Students should start turning assignments on time specially those who dont turn in on time, the club would help many students like instead of going home and forgot that they have assignments to do they could come and join the after school homework club. I have friends who like to do homework and be successful, but the problem is that they dont understand the assignments and if someone dont understand something why should they do it because either way they going to get the assignment wrong the school must provide more support for students. In addition the club could not be just of getting help or finish assignments early, the club could be a place were students can find support and motivation in order to be a better person on life many students dont care about school because they dont find the good thing about it maybe because they need a motivation to be at school the after school club could be a place where people can meet and share ideas or meet each other and make a friendship helping each other to understand better the thing that they dont understand. In conclusion the school must make the after school club in order to get more successful students and to also help and motivate students to do their assignments and turning them on time. extra support is a better way to understand the things you dont understand, turning assignments make a student seem responsible and also get a good admiration of others making friends and share, discuss thing together is a better way to solve a problem that they had.",6,6,6,5,5,6,1633,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Second thing it would persuade them which type of diploma they would like to have if the advances diploma or the standard diploma, the advance diploma it requires to have 9 sol pass and all the classes and for the for standard it requires 6 sol and all the clases. when you enter to high shool your counselor would guide you which diploma the student want to have and which career for the future. third when you are in high school they give the student basic classes that you need to pass for 9 grade and 10 grade to persuade faster and easier , to have some experiencies and knowleged on what are your goals and be prepared on the others two years, if you like the same career you pick when you enter high school or you want to change your mind on a diffrent type career want to do, teachers and counselor are a great full help for student to succes to guide the student what are some great benefits the career the students pick to study to give him the amount of money to lived and work with the career and be succesful in the future when the student finished the high school. Finally for 11 grade and 12 grade they give the student some diffult classes to pass to graduated from high school , 11 grade is more diffult to pass, Beacuse it requires 2 classes to graduated pass for to get 12 grade the student only come for the classes the counselor give student to be prepared for what diploma the student choose , if his the advance diploma or standard diploma for his or her carrer the student choose to graudated. for my conclusion is a wonderful way to start in a young age , To start thiking what would you want for your future if this is a great career to pick and whats benefits give you for your future, in high school they prepared you for what the student planing to do when he or her graduated from high school , if his going to college to have a better life or go nova to be prepared on what you like to do in the future, You hvae some knowleges of what carrer you would succes in the future and start thiking this is what you like for your carrer and make it real the dream what you want to become in the future. there many career you can choose to become someone in life , this is way i think they should start at the young age when they enter to high school teacher and counselor would do the best to make the student to choose one career studen is interested on. to study in the future and sucess on college to have a better life for her or his family in the future, thats why is great idea to start at the age to pick the career they want to do on future.",5,5,5,5,4,4,3613,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

518,1300,8BA694ACE2D9,"Being Against An Extended School Day - Generic_Name Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the schools schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules. Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their lockers present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a students day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone. With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension. A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences. Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with. Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain. As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school. Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

At school, you dont only made friends and memories , you also earn and learn good advices, and you see different perspectives. People who are not socialist tend to be ones who graduated by taking online classes; they dont know how to interact with people, because they had spent most of their life talking and interacting with their computers. Sometimes we are the cause why people rather to take online classes, we separate them by diseases, illness and mental problems, not a lot of students at school have the chance to receive help or talk with their counselor ; this is one of the reasons why people doesnt want to attend to school, and choose online classes. A lot of cases now days about why people decide to course home school are: Pregnancy at early age: The girls who get pregnant while they are in High School either take home school or dont go study anymore, when their belly starts growing they feel ashamed, and they tend to quit school.

Although, many people argue that technology is affecting the people saying that human spend most of their time using technology, for things that are not productive. I think that technology is good because you need it for your daily. For example, if you are a student you can use technology to help you to do homework, project, or specific things that require technology. However, there are some people that need technology for their life that is require, if you are very sick doctors will have to use technology to understand what sickness do you have. To begin with, using technology you can do many things at the same time that can help you in your daily. For example, there are some time when you have a lot of things to do, and you dont have a lot of time, but if you use technology you will able to make it, because you can do many things at the same time with technology. Also, technology help you with your job, now there are many machines that you can use in your job that does not need any force of your body, those machines work by using technology. If you work as a security you can security the building by just be in one office and use technology, you can install cameras around the build and you can security the building from that office by using the camaras, so you wont have to be walking around all the build, and will take you a lot of time to make it. Second, technology can make your life easier. People require to technology when there are things that human can not do. For example there are some job that are very hard that require a big force that is impossible for human, but they can use some special machines that are very strong and can do the work. Also, you can search in google things that you dont know. For example, address,news, thing about History, books it is much easier to read a book in google than going to the library that take you more time than just type the book tittle in google. Finally, technology also help schools, every schools use technology for their information. For axemple teachers have computer where they has the information of their students, where they has their work all the materials that they need to teach. Also, teachers have special programthat they use to teach, make easier their work. However, teacher, and schools do almost all their work by using technology. in addition, students need technology to do their classwork when it require to use computer, or personal divice.

523,1305,A0B58CDB939A,We choose our own character traits. Because you are responsible for yourself and waht you want in your life. A lot of people are going to defenetly critisize your traits and tell you that you are not good at this and that. Therefore you are responsible to succeed in life by doing the right things and using the right traits. For example if someone else comes and tells that you are not good at your job and you know you are doing good and everyone tells that you are doing awesome. And you are strong and cofident at what you do then you are good. In the other hand people think that traits are formed by influences or beyond our control. But influence comes from our own family. For example our ancestor could have done the things that our dad or mom are wanting us to be doing. Therefore our traits are every good because our dad and mom already did the traits that our ancester thought them. Fortheremore we are getting strong and have the capacity to teach others about what traits are all about. As a result the younger genaration is learning about a trait really is. Traits really means a lotin life becuase a trait definetly describes how your personality really is and what you are really good at. For example if you are good at playing soccer thats a persona trait. Sometimes it takes a long time to learn what really your traits are. But if you now you are good at something show the world who you really. Our character traits are more important than we realise beacause it defines how you are. In addition our traits is what gets you a real job or a habbit that you have. Also character traits are you being smart you acting or doing other things. For example helping your brother or your friends at school is a trait because you now the topic and they dont. In Addition of this is waht deifnes your character traits. In conclusion we are the ones that decide our traits even now our parents or other people try to tell us what to do. At the end we are the ones that decide our future and what really our character traits are. And where we to fully develop them.

524,1306,F53E50C57938,"Technically, students spend seven hours in school and seventeen hours at home regardless of what time they sleep or what they do when they get home. Students should have more time to study at home, rest and prepare for the next day. More hours in school will ware out the student causing it to effect their grades. I disagree with the school boards plan to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life. Not all activities student perform happens in school. Adding an hour and a half to the school day can affect the student progress at home. For example, a student can be a player in a local soccer or basketball team, adding more hour will give the student less time to practice and get ready to the game or match and the student will also have little time to do his/her homework or complete an assignment or project given to them. The student having less time to practice is going to take a big tow on his/her team. Maybe the student is a very good player and his/her team needs him/her,he/she having small time to practice will make the team lose the match. This decision will not only effect the student but the teachers too. Everyone wants to go home and relax from a long day work. The decision of adding ninety minutes to the school day is going to interrupt what the teacher and student do in their everyday life. Some teachers have families they have to take care of. They may have to pick their child or children from the babysitter, preschool or school if the dont use the bus. They also have doctor or dentist appointment they have to attend or have to take their children to. Teachers have chores or duties they must preform at home like shopping for groceries or picking little brother or sister from school. It could also be that they have another place to work at after school in order to earn more money. Both students and teacher have busy lives this decision is going to effect them.

I disagree with the school boards idea to extend the school day because students have extracurricular activities to do when they are not at school,and it disturb both the students and the teachers personal life.

527,1309,CA290993DFBA,"Many students and teachers think that taking online classes are bad for the students and the school. The reason is that the students might not take any notes on what the teacher is saying. The other reason is that students will often get distracted from the lecture the teacher is giving to them. Students cannot be benefited of taking online classes because students might not take notes and that the students might not pay attention to the teacher. Students might not take notes while being on a class that is online. For example, at school, students take notes because they are being watched by the teacher, so why would they do it if they are not being watched by the teacher; the students would not care about the notes. If the teacher is on the screen, but cannot see if the student is taking notes; most likely there are not because the students wont worry that the teacher could check them. Students should take notes when they get information about a topic, so that topic could stay in the mind of the student if they write it and they also try understand the topic from the notes. Teachers wont even know there students are taking notes because its online they cannot see them. also the students might not be paying attention. The students might not pay any attention to the lecture the teacher is giving to them. For example, when a student looks around the classroom, but not at the teacher, they will miss valuable information that is needed, so its like the same when it comes to online classes; information will be missed by the students. Missing information when distracted is terrible because students might miss out on what is going on in the class, might miss on something on they have to do, and miss on how to do there work. Students should pay attention; no one likes to miss any key information; therefore, students need to look at the teacher to get more information as needed to do an assignment. When students dont take notes, they will not only miss out on some key information, but might panic on how to do a problem on the assignment they were given. The students cannot benefit from taking online classes because the students might not write valuable information in there notes and they might not pay attention to lecture that teacher is giving to them. The students wont take any notes because no one is watching them take the notes as the teacher goes on lecturing. The students could miss valuable information because they are not paying attention to the teacher, and the students might miss on how to do something in a assignment. From not taking notes to note paying attention is the reason why there cannot be students taking online classes because teachers might not know what the students are doing and students might not even care about all of this.",6,6,8,8,7,7,2749,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
528,1310,02B36EBD5C66,"Students can benefit from this option, but also can affect them in different ways. Many students have difficulty coming to school every single day. One impediment may be transportation, a lot of them do not know how to drive, so they can not drive to school. Some students live in areas where the buses cant enter. Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school. Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete. It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them. Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school. In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying. If this program does not exist many of them could never go again to school, because of all the impediments they have to attend school, and they will never accomplish their dreams.

529,1311,D2517350CB3A,"Elective classes are chosen by student who are intresting to be part of it. Many students Probably prefer to have a elective clase because they are learning what they like, and will be less difficult for them to understand the class. In my positon students should be required to take elective classes because they attend to school every day, students are teach in what they want to learn and students are much success in class. Many students do not attend to school in order to not have a clase that they do not like. Students that use to not attend school is when he/she have a class that is not intresting to learn; they may think that the class is not important enough to help them in a future, and letting students to take elective classes probably will stop the absence of many kids because they will want to know new things about the class . Furthermore if students have an elective class they will have that exicitement to start the class on time and not be late, neither to miss school any day because of their interest of learning . Students should be guide in what they may think is useful and much helful for them. In some school people had heard that many students are teach In things that may not be needed in life like art, some students take art because they like that clase and problably because In the future they Might be plaining to become an art teacher, but for others is preferable to select an elective class that will manage her/ him to be succsessful. As a result of take an eletive class can be a tool for students to discover what subject is most important for them to have knowledge and have the passion of keep learning. However other may say that students should be required to take a music, art , drama class because students can have intertainment having these kind of classes, but I stiil be thinking that students should be required to take an elective class because learning what they like, they put much effort to get knowledge and good grades, for example study, pay attention to what the teacher is saying participating in class or any other activity. Moreover obtain good results of what they decide to choose to become a successful student. Students who take elective classes have the advantage of learn what is interesting for them , and be succsess no just in class also might be helpful for students in a future. Be able to choose a class is a good opportunity because it helps students to be intresting in new projects, know new things and obtain a good education at school. Obtaing a good education might encourage students to be succsessfuly in other classes and in other places.",7,6,7,7,6,6,2916,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

533,1315,EA970C38817C,"Do you think people accomplish more if they are always doing something or do you think inactivity serve as a purpose? Thomas Jefferson wrote,""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing.""Many people think that they accomplish more if they are always doing something. When people are always doing something,they are always learning new things and gaining experiences. Some people think that the more they do ,the more they achieve because being idle will not lead you to success and nobody is going to come and accomplish things for you. Therefore much may be done if people are always doing something Certainly some people think that inactivity serve as a purpose because people can be physically inactive but mentally active and they might be creating wonderful things in their minds. Still others think that being inactive does not mean that they are being idle because they already achieved their dreams and they are satisfied with what they have so that is why they see inactivity as a purpose. Others might think that not everyone have the opportunities to being always doing something and they do not have more option that being inactive. However, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they learn new things in the process of doing something. They learn more about themselves and about others. They learn how to interact and connect with others and how to fit in different environments. People who are always doing something gain more and new experiences that will help them later in life also gaining experiences and being in different types of environments surrounded by different kind of people will help them improve their mental maturity and also help them to to have a different perspective of see world and life. In other words people who are always doing something accomplish more,and learn more how to interact with others and gain new experiences. Furthermore,people accomplish more if they are always doing something because the more you do the more you achieve. If people do not work and make an effort for the things they want to accomplish nobody is going to do it for them because each person is the author of their own success .Some people might be waiting that the things they want fall from the sky ,or appear magically in their hands making no effort to accomplish them and idles will not lead you to success .People who are successful today is because they were always working hard and making their best effort to accomplish their goals,they know what they wanted and they were persistent and did not give up on their goals. If people want to be successful in life they have to know that failure is part of achieving success and just have to keep trying and do not give up until they achieve their goals. Therefore peoples success is based on the effort they put to achieve it because the more they do the more they achieve. In fact, people accomplish more if they are always doing something because they are spending their time in things that really worth it .If people are going to spend time of their life that will never get back they better spend that time doing something that worth it and doing something that is going bring positive ,and good things to their life. Many people spend a lot of time or even their whole life doing things that never brought something positive or good to their life and that is maybe because they never found their passion in life and doing something you are not passionate about it is just a waste of time. Therefore people should spend time following their dreams and doing what they truly love because when they are doing what they are truly passionate about, they will see that every effort they did to accomplish their goal worth the time they spent and the effort they put .As a result when people spend their time always doing something they accomplish more. In conclusion,people should determine never to be idle and never to conform with what they have. Always work hard and aspire for bigger things ,always try to be successful and do everything and anything to accomplish their dreams, and goals and do not let anyone to tell you that you can not do something because if you believe in yourself you are capable to do everything you want .People should always spend their time in things that worth it, in things that will bring good and positive things to their life .People should be always doing something and that is how they will see what wonderful things can be done by doing always something because the more people do the more they achieve and people who are always doing something are the people who accomplish the more.

534,1316,1087B6C7FB98,"I say its a good idea that the school menu should change to being more healthier because a lot of students eat junkfood mostly everyday, need to eat more fruits and vegetables, and wanting a healthy live. As you know, students eat junkfood food anywhere they go to such as movie theaters, gas stations, and restaurants. Some places do serve healthy foods and snacks but people rather choose junkfood because theyre not use to eating good. Most stores put the unhealthy foods in the front, so kids can go straight into putting it in their carts or baskets. However, we cant manage telling people if they want to eat healthy or not. Every school want kids to get a fruit or a vegetable at lunch. Some kids chose not to get a fruit or vegetable because they dont care about eating it or they it just throw away. Eating veggies will help you with your body like for an example; a carrot will help with your eyes. If kids dont want to get any of their fruits or veggies they could give it to a friend that will love to eat it instead of wasting it. Eating healthy will not cause you to have much problems but, eating unhealthy will cause much problems. I think parents should focus on what their kids are eating for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. If you dont like eating unhealthy you could always pack lunch. Although, you could eat junkfood once or twice a week and not everyday. I personality agree to having the school changing the school menu because the world has change and we want to eat more fruit and veggies, having our lives healthy, and wanting kids to stop eating junk food all the time. It has been an issue for the past years and I think its time for schools to have different types of food. Not everyone wants to eat healthy food we could sometime have some unhealthy at lunch.

535,1317,C5E45F477A84,"Have you ever met someone, or an interviewer, and show a good or bad impression to them? People think that first impression can be changed because everybody has a second chance. While others think that first impression can not be changed because it shows who you are. I agree to the motion that first impression are impossible to change because it shows your personality, your attitude and who you are. Firstly, first impressions are impossible to change because it shows your personality. I had a friend, who dressed inappopriartely to an interview for her job. But to her surprise she did not get the job because of how she dressed. Also after a while, she couldnt get any job elsewhere. This means that whenever you go somewhere, you should dress appropriately, check how you use your tone with others, so people will know that you are a good person, respectful, can take responsibiliy for your actions and shows how mature you are. Not only does first impressions show your personality, however, it shows your attitude. Additionally, showing your attitude is most likely impossible to change. I remember I used to disrespect, fight and insult others when they did something to me I didnt like or even if they needed help from me. I met this old lady and she asked for my help then I told her that I didnt want to and insulted her, then she said to me I am going to have a hard time in life but i didnt take what sh said seriouly and left. As a result of what happened, as I grew up, I tried to change but couldnt because when something goes bad and I knew it was not me, they will all mention my name. And I wish there was someone there to offend me. And thats when I remembered what the old lady told me, I wanted to go ask for forgiveness but unlucky for me she went to heaven and now am left with her curse. Which gives me this conclusion that always respect everyone you see even if you dont know them. First impressions also shows the kind of person you really are. Furthermore, your impressions shows who you are. Not long ago, this was this lady on the news. When i heard the news it shocked me because she went to a store, picked an ice cream from the fridge, licked it, and put it back in the fridge without paying for it. This obviously shows that, she ruined her reputation in public and everywhere. Now everyone knows who she really is. Not only did it ruined reputation but she brought a shame to herself, her family, and also her native country. First impressions are impossible to change. Lastly, it is valid that first impressions can be changed because everyone has a second chance. But not really because sometimes your impressions towards someone stays the same even if you change. Others will think you are not your self today and also others will think its a good thing but not everyone depending on what impression you made on your first time meeting. So I say that first impressions likely impossible to change. In a Nutshell, showing your character, who you are, and your behaviour are impossible to change on your first impression. Mostly first impressions are not easy to change. Would you on your first impression be respectful or disrespectful, appopriate or inoppopriate, and be willing to take responsiblity of the concequences of you on seeing someone older than you, are you?",9,8,9,8,7,7,2678,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

537,1319,2CD73298526F,"The use of technology has had a negative effect on peoples lives, because they tempt to take the use of technology as a fundumental part of their life. They get so attached that they miss beautiful moments, people or opportunities, life is full of extraordinary places and people to share life with but why make all that dissapear just to be on a phone or any other technological device. Technology can be consider a threat for families. Why would it be consider a threat? Well, lets say you and your family are going to Generic_City, you go to the best hotel an as soon as you get there your wife, your children or even you go on their phones immediately without wanting to do or go anywhere. There could also be another example with that, a family reserves a table on the best expensive restaurant in Generic_City and as soon as the family sits down they all go on their phones, even the parents gave that example instead of them wanting to have a nice family dinner. Families lose the connection due to cell phones because just like that family had a date with their phones and not with their own family the connection starts to decrease and after all that itll be hard to have that open conncetion with your family. Thats consider a threat because youre letting the use of technology define how your family will be or do things in there lives. It could also be a positive effect because and not all families struggle with the addiction to technology, people such as; doctors, judges, lawyers, businessman, etc... They have a job and the best way to keep in contact with people that need of them, they have to always be using their cell phones or computers to be in touch with them no matter where or what they are doing. But that shouldnt be any excuse not to have a family time, family comes over everything, you cant miss moments with your family or else youll regret it in the future youll just remember being on the phone that entire time. Dont let technology control you or your family. Love could also vanish do to the lack of commitment with your phone. Relationships now a days are very different from back then, they dont get to be more romantic well they could but maybe through texting. The love they had for each other could easily be broken do to social media, either the guy or the girl could possibly find someone else and cheating happenes, I know that does not the whole reason why but it does affect you in a way. Lets talk about Khloe Kardashian, she being a famous women had to receive the bad news of her baby dad cheating on her moments before she gave birth. In some cases couples dont get to enjoy their date because one of them is in there phone. Ive seen that breaking up through text is the biggest excuse for a men or woman, if social media didnt work like it does now there woulndnt be a lot of cheatings. Social media could also be used for good, if you are in a long distance relationship you have the opportunity to talk to your significant other across the world and also because you get to know someone you might marry in the future. But is still bad, social media causes a lot of things to happen such as suicide or having eating disorders or even bulling. Technology has a negative effect on most kids in elementary, middle or high school. Back then you woulndt see little kids having the latest phone, because the new generation that is coming is more open minded about how ""society"" works. There might be things I dont even know and yet you ask a seven year old kid and they know it already, Society has changed a lot from when I was a little girl to how kids are now. KIds are mostly connected on their phone most of them just want to stay home and play Fortnite, not only kids play that all grown ups which makes them looks so childish in my opinion, while before they would really want to go outside to play any sports they could. Little kids having phones at there early age makes them have bad grades in school because there main focus is texting, videos, or video games which dont take them anywhere. The percentage of students having good grades has decreease in a way that surprises you. how many times you see little babies asking for their paretns phone and what do parents do, they give them there phone because they cant control their children what will make them obey is technology. In some way it could be good because they get the chance to have more opportunities in school wise, like having computers in our home helps get your grade up if you use it wisely, some parents dont have the money to buy their kid a computer while schools does provide some dont take a good opportunity. Just look at how children are attached to there phones. Focusing in school will give you so much opportunities that will take you on a greater point in your life and I feel like that is what we need to make all of them understand. In conclusion, Is good to have technology but dont use it to hurt people which will take them to commit suicide or having eating disorders. Cherish every moment you get to have with your loved ones dont let technology control who you are or who you can be. People dont have the same human contact anymore because they are more worried that theyll get a text that they need to respond as soon as possible. Live every moment to the fullest you never kknow what could happen in ten minutes or the next day. ",6,7,8,7,8,7,594,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
538,1320,3C56844D4CF0,"Many students become involved in extracurricular activities enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to or complete homework assignments. In my opinion it would be better if the school has controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. Therefore, school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential. Secondly, school count by with the necessary tools that students needed. Thirdly, school helped the students a level physical with the sports. If the school simplify by pushing the controls and the extracurricular activities for the students, their are more productive at school and teaching-learning process undoubtedly be win-win for all the participants involved in this activities. The first reason that support the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school offer the capacity that students have to develop their potential some students to take advantage of the opportunities, while that some students their classes seems boring. For example, I dont have any idea that the biology class was a interesting class, because I was observing the animals, plants, bacteria, and human body, biology is a wonderful class in this class I learn the importance that have the activities in the school. Therefore, everything was I learn because the schools offer to me the capacity to develop me potential. The second reason the school has a controls in the students involvement in extracurricular activities. If school count with the necessary tools that students needed, research has shown that teenagers experience with the school has a control with the students. For example, the school count with the books, computers, and different classes, and with everything that a students needed to their life , this statement helped to students go to different schools. Some instruments has the ability to change the students attitude and impact everyone and should be strongly considered. The last reason to support the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities, is school helped the students a level physical with the sports. Some schools helped the students to have the best level the sports and to make the dreams to paying. For example, my youngest brother playing in soccer team this is good for him, and he says me everything in the team is wonderful and is a inspiration for him because he has a the most wonderfully experiences in the sports. Students can be more productive at school and in their activities, because the schools bring the opportunity to parctice some sport. I truly believer that having the school has a control in the students involvement in extracurricular activities can be more would better is the right step towards a more convenient and enjoyable educational experience, and considered that schools offered the potential that students have to developed their potential, by and large school count with the necessary instruments that students needed, lastly school helped the students a level physical with the sports, I hope my voice get heard to the schools and their make this issues, schools can be more productive if their has the control with the students.",7,5,6,5,4,6,779,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

540,1322,ED937FC56246,"The one thing I hope I accomplish is to get a high paying job. I would want a high paying job since it could pay off many things that I dont need to pay later. My reasons is to travel to many places Ive never been to, buy many things as I want without spending my family moneys, and I would try many different foods that could be expensive. One reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that I never been to. Traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or dont need. Sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. Having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. I think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything youve ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money. The next reason is to buy many things as I want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. This is important because it wouldnt matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on. Another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. When you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. Another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money. The last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. From my experiences I know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. I also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. Sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people wouldve gone crazy. Paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad. In conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places youve never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. Going to places you have never been to is great. Spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. Also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it.

For example one day at my school students got into agreement saying that they are happy with the school menus that they have those why many students do not skip classes. Other students may not like the idea of changing because they think the new change will worst then they have. If schools change to healthier food for students many student will be in the class to learn and stop thinking about skiing class to go buy food. For example one of my classmate always goes out to from school during class to buy food and i ask him why he said the school food are not good enough for him and those the problem he skip class to go to buy food. changing school food will be good idea and also bad because same students want same food they have now day but other want change and those where all arguing start. The good way to make students happy about is to keep the one they most like and get ruined of the one they do not like. Some may argue that changing school menu would be bad idea because the new menu would be something that the students may not like do or not healthier for them. Other people think that many students get sick when they eat school food and many students are not learning and they do not go to classes in time or they skip same periods. In my idea i think changing school menu would be good idea because the menus that school provides are not healthier and same of them are not good for our bodies. The best way to provides healthy food for student is change the menu that most students heat. To summarize, the main reason to change school menus is there are many students agree with the idea and there same who disagree about changing the school menu. I think good way to solve this problem is they have to keep the menu they already have and students like to eat most. And change for those who agree with the idea. Otherwise it will clause same problem for school principal.",7,5,7,6,5,7,1275,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
542,1324,2BE11993FB5F,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I personally disagree with this statement because, many times i have been told that i have a bad first impression the first time people see me, many people say i look mean and with a bad attitude. However, i do not have an attitude when people are friendly or speak me. New research says that it is far easier to loose a good reputation, then to gain one. Which is true, but you would never know how is the other person until you speak to them. You cannot judge a person by the way they look, speak or drees. For example, couple of years back on my first day of school, in the United States, people would judge me because, they thought i knew English, and when they would speak to me, i would put my head down and not say anything, months later i learned english and knew how to have a conversation with them; Not long a long, i had a person come to me and say; I did not thnk you spoke english, because i remember back in 6th grade, you would not talk. He changed the way he thought of me when i started having a conversatiomn with him. Perphas, You can always change you first impression. First impressions are clearly not the best ones, but we can always make a choice on wheather change them or not. I have experienced many first impressions.

543,1325,C79292B5F78A,"My thoughts on this are that it is good time and this should actually occur for many reasons first of all during the weekdays young people have school everyday only if it is a holiday or if sick. By implying this more young people will get out of the streets so late at night there is no need to be out so late at night in the first place. Second of all, at 10 p. m is a great time to be home during the weekdays it will keep you out of trouble and there will be less chances of young people dying to other criminals at night. Late at night is where most of all crimes occur and now the chances of this will be lower. Third of all , as their are so many people that sell drugs and if young people have to be home so early the chance of them getting into all types of drugs will be so much lower. If this does become a law the times are also very appropriate Monday through Friday until 10 p. m and then Saturday through Sunday until 12 p. m no one needs to be on the streets later then this time that is being given. If they are their out so late there should be a extreme reason as to why they would be ""breaking the law"". This will most likely keep young people out of more troubles then they all ready are. This time is not unfair it is a very generous time to be home. This really should not be interfering with any ones life you can still go out but not be out for so late at night. I would understand if this law was also for people over the age of 18 because young adults like to party. But this law should actually be for people under the age of 18 that would make more sense and being a ""adult""(over the age of 18) they know what is right from wrong,what they should be doing, and what they should not be doing. This law is not to harm anyone but it would to improve the community curfews to keep teenagers out of trouble I can very much agree with that. But those young teenagers are not doing the right thing then no matter what law that is added nothing will change the fact of how they act(keep them out of trouble). Going back to the time it is not like this law will be implying that the young people do not hang out with their friends this is just so more people can stay safe from all the trouble that is the streets. A lot of innocent people die every year by being so late at night and in the streets where some of the bad people come out. They have all after school to be doing after school activities this will not keep anyone from doing what they want. It is just a way to keep young people out of trouble there should be excuses to all of this like going to a party but there as well should be a limit to all of this. The consequence if they break the law should start of as a warning and then just be adding on to that. My position on this curfew law is also that I would understand why people do not want this to happen but at the same time teenagers do know what they should be doing and what they should not be doing. I have two different view points why they should be worried and why they should not be worried. I know that people like to have sleep overs and would this be included or do they have to specifically in their house on can they be sleeping at someone else . Back into my other view if they go to a party lets say over the weekend where the curfew is at 12 p. m because it is on a Saturday and they come back at 1 p. m or later .They are not keeping track of time and lose the time. They are having fun with all of their friends and then they get caught because someone calls the police. Then the police comes and now they have to face the law and all that. Now what is next that being on their record just because they stayed out longer then they had and were on the streets. This would honestly suck and then going home and getting in trouble by your parent because of a mistake you made. After all this wanting to go to a very good college and they not accepting them just because they made a mistake for staying to late at the party. This would be a down side because if anyone breaks the law that will go on there record and not come out of there permit sadly this is a consequence that can happen and would suck. A college not accepting them because they "" broke the law"" not fun at all because colleges do look at everything anyone does before getting accepted and being a very good student with a high GPA and hearing this would not be good they will be carrying that guilt for their whole life by not getting into the college that they want to get into. On the other note right now there is not a curfew to what time teenagers should be home yet but there is a curfew to when who ever has their permit for driving. So that is also a big restriction no young teenager is out in their car at a late time the only time you can actually see them is when they are getting out of school. There are pros and cons to this ""law"" but I think there are mostly pros then cons everything is very much reasonable and understanding. The only down/con that I can personally thin of right now is that they get caught and that going in their record does not sound good at all. But overall there are a lot of pros to this and this law should be seriously implied to all of the United States not only to one city but to all of them. This will keep more people safe yes pf course there is always that one person who wants to break the law as a joke or something that really should not be anything to play around with or anything but something that all young people listen to it take it serious. In conclusion this law or curfew will stop all of these thieves from stealing young girls or boys and then selling them as well as to stop rape from happening so much because sometime it is very hard to detected people because of how dark it is. But this will most likely lower the chance of all these negative things to happen so frequently to anyone. It will also keep young people out of lots of trouble by being so late at night less danger.",6,6,7,7,8,8,2712,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
544,1326,B5FF33681C22,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home. Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved. However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless. Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family. In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more.

Projects of any kind will look and be better when in groups, lots of ideas will be on the table for everyone to look and pick from. Working at school is hard.

Group projects are so helpful because the project will be split up into parts where everyone in your group can take a part of it, all they have to do is post it together when finished. Having not to do all of it by your self is super nice. Another beneficial gift in working in groups is that you will be able to learn teamwork. Learning that is a good skill because youll need teamwork for your life time. New people, classmates, workers, and much more will want to work with you because of how you and your team get along with one another. Projects of all kinds have to look good.

548,1330,D30D6D7F3D39,"Some teachers think about the benefits of working with a group or working alone. I feel that working together would be more helpful for all students because they can share more ideas, have less work and can be working with less stress. Students can have a little conversation for get more information, then they can pick one or more ideas for make their work more easy . They can argue from each idea that could be more important. Every students have different thoughts that can help them to realize a good work. For example, When I was in my country my teacher said that we can choose work together or alone, and I prefer to work alone because I thought that working alone was more beneficial for me but I was really confused about it. Working together help us to know different option and students can have more social communication. Working together imply to have less work. Students can be take more opportunities for learn new thing everyday, also that can help teachers too. Less work can be helpful for a lot students because they can realize missing work, extra work and other activities during class. Furthermore, I remember when I was in 6 grade my teacher said that less work can help you to have more time for you that means that sometimes with less work teachers and students could learn and have more progress. Some classes can be stressful for a many students because teachers need to realize all activities during their classes and sometime students do not understand what they need to do. Otherwise, working together would be more easy for students to finish their work quickly. One important fact in my life that I never forgot is when my English teacher said that we have just 10 minutes for take the exam, and everyone fail because he was very strict with us. Working with another person have a lot benefits for reduce stress. Students can help each other and check their own work . In conclusion, Working together could be very helpful for many students who need help for get better grades during the year.

On the other hand,some people agree with this statement. People should try to do something beyond what they have already mastered since their confident level will grow,it makes them feel good,and make their live easier. However,not everybody agree with position,some people claim that people can grow in live without trying something new because they dont want to get out of their comfort zone and try new things. Nevertheless,this opposition other important,namely that trying new things give us a high level of confident. For example,my biggest fear in live is airplanes and i never been on it,but if i try it for the first time in my live even i scare or not next time,i would have more confident for trying new thing since when the airplane was my biggest fear and i try it. I could do more. Further more, trying new things make our confident level high which is an important thing in our live. In addition,it makes us feel good. For instance,my cousin was always sad and she hated to try new things. One day we went swimming,everyone had fun except my cousin. After condensing her for a long time,she try it. On that time,my cousin was so happy that she even wants to be a swimmer now. Thus,people should try new things to make them feel good and happy. Finally,it makes the live easy. To illustrate,if someone be so strike in live and doesnt wants to try something beyond what he/she already mastered,that person will have a hard live. The person will never grow in live since he/she scares to get out the comfort zone and try new thing. Moreover,we should get out of our comfort zone so we could have an easy live.

550,1332,3C693CBFEFB5,"Have you ever wanted to know if your attending a classes from home does it benefit you ? Many students want to be educated and successful but, many problems come in there way causing public or private schools not to be the best decision for them. They decide they want to do school online and have said it has befitted them so much because, when they were doing public school they were failing there classes or the problems they were facing got harder for them to be in school. Many students have done online school and have been so successful and not only being successful but it has benefited them in whatever situation Theyre in right now. Although some may argue otherwise, but through family experiences, prodcasts ive watched on the radio, and from hearing some celebrities talk. One of my cousins named Generic_Name has been through so much and has not been able to continue going to public school. shes struggling a lot trying to keep her grades up and trying to get to school on time. she has an eating disorder. An eating disorder can be really hard at times when dealing with that and school . Her family has decided to let her do online school , and has helped her so much because while being at home eating and also going to doctor appointments she has the option to do her assignments online and also sometimes some teachers come to her house do homework assignments with her that help her a ton. Through online school she has overcame her struggle with her eating disorder and has also been so successful. As many years went by she has studied more an more. ""its so crazy"" because while having so many problems she was facing she became a lawyer. Some may argue that its impossible how she became a lawyer after just doing online school, that its unfair how she got to where she is now because of home schooling, some people may say that by doing online school it cant benefit you nor can it make you a successful person its just they way to failure. Thats not true because when you hear so many stories and people talking about their experiences with home schooling you have to take to consideration that maybe it helps some and not others. Many prodcasts on the radio have mentioned many real life situations on this subject . One ive heard that struck out to me was when this mom was talking about her son Generic_Name being really popular on social media, She said that all throughout his high school years students his age and older have been bullying him and trying to get in fights with him for no reason. The mom signed her son up for online schooling. Generic_Name did online school as well as he did video conferences with his teachers every other day . Generic_Name has found it to be more easy he said that he is more concentrated because, its just him and his laptop theres no distractions no more students bothering him trying to fight him. Since social media is such a big thing to keep up with when doing online school ,he can do both social media and be educated. However, some may argue that Generic_Name has to be a man and grow up, he cant always hide from people that are mean to him. Thats true he cant always hide from people like that, but if hes fed up with it then maybe it was the best decision you can only handle so much hate. Celebrities have talked in their interviews about them choosing home school over school and how beneficial it was to them. Theres this girl named Generic_Name .She said Being big on social media is really hard Dealing with the hate, dealing with people exposing you constantly for nothing, dealing with your name always being in peoples mouth. Generic_Name has said that shes been bullied so many times and has found it harder for to deal with it. She has said that at one point she got depression and got harder and harder for her to continue going to public schools. Teachers recommended her to do online school. She took that advice and did home schooling for the rest of high school and also did online school for college as well. She said that she feels more successful. Generic_Name said that online school was the best thing she did and that she decided that for college she is going to a public college and she is also going to continue being big on social media. Some may argue that, They dont see how it benefited her. It have a major change on her, she knew what she wanted to do or be so how did it benefit her. It benefited her in so many ways, she no longer is afraid of what people think of her on social media. Sometimes people need space from public school and then when they feel that they are ready they can go to public schools again. The importance is for people that are going through the same problems for them to look and read from past experiences. For them to see if online school is beneficial for them. In the future people can look back at this and see what people were going through and how much they were struggling. This helps to see about how the past was like to compare to how its like now. A solution is for people to do online school if they feel like being in public school is harder for them or for, whatever reason it may be. Also for people to notice and to realize that as being said multiple times that for people that are big on social media Its hard to cope with all the hate they get. A solution is for people not to give hate to others. ",6,6,7,6,5,6,780,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
551,1333,B68C62AB1515,"Careers are a big part of a persons life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a persons personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they wont have to worry about it in their adult lives. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often dont know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there. A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students dont really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who dont take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students dont know what to do in their free time. Also, students dont really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes dont really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them. Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them. A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they wont have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens dont know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they wont have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age wont have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older wont have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students arent as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be. If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they wont be as stressed. Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time.

If your having trouble with your work the teachers or students can help you and they will show you how to do it. The teachers will explain how your making mistakes. some students may not have a good home and the may not be able to complete there assignments because of the fact that they dont have supplies to complete there work so the teachers and students can help the student who needs help. Second many students get low grades due to incomplete homework. In the club the students complete homework then turn it in the next day. students will turn homework in on time everyday. Students can work on classwork, projects, and homework. students can complet homework early so they will not do it on the last day. Finaly other students can volunteer to help students. Students can get rewards for helping others. students can particpate for class grades. Both students learn from working together. They learn there mistakes and correct each others papers. In concluson i think starting an after school homework club is a good idea heres why. You can get help with your work and many students will not have low grades due to incomplete homework.

I think this a perfect activity because kids like to compete each other and is better when they know that if they win they get some candys. Another enjoyable activity will be in science, doing a project of how animals live what thay ate and how they survive to the other animalto and give some importants facts to the teacher , i think this project may be of two persons because a think this will be to easy for them and there may be some student doing the project by them self. I think that will like the project because they can get to know about an animal life and importants stuff about it and they can have fun with friends. I choose math and science because this are my favorites subjects and i enjoy doing them with my friends and my teachers my favorite part is when we get to work in group that is in science, but in math my favorite part is when i get a question right some time the teacher give me some candys.

The curfew would keep teenagers safe by the increase of robberies. The curfew would save teenagers out of trouble by not letting teenagers go outside by them selves.

When teenagers are left home alone, they get scared because they are by themselves and they are afraid that someone would break into their house. Most house robberies occur at night and it makes teenagers worry that robberies can take place anywhere. Teenagers regret going anywhere at night because of the curfew and robbers.

Some teenagers wont go outside either because they are scared of dark, and that kidnappers with catch them, because robbers and kidnappers are often out in midnight.

People has different passion for example they are people that want to learn about sing,dance,write,read,technology and more in depends in what would you like to learn .High school were made to learn about important things about Science,Math, History,English and some of them are fun. However there are some high schools that requires to have a class of drama,or art before you graduate at least you have to have one class it can be drama or art. I believe schools should have more options to students for example music,dance, sports, sing ,cook ,technology,cars,and more because no everyone is interest in drama or art. It should be elective by the students, first reason why it should be elective is because the people have different passion and dreams,second reason is that might be helpful to identified who you are,and it would help you to success. One of my passion is to make new tings that no one has never ever create something that can be helpful to heal people life. Thats my passion and my dream .The last school that I went they require two elective classes but is optional the students have the right to choose. My counselor help me to find out some elective classes about science and humans it was really hard to find the right class for me. Somehow they were some students in the same classroom and they were boring,sleeping. The reason why they were like that is because thats not them passion they probably want to be learning about something different. Thats why is important to be in a class where you really feel that you going to learn. So that can happen to many students thats why is really important to know what are your passions and to be free to choose at least one elective class. Two years afters I finish the elective class my brain was confused everything change because before taking those classes it was hard for me to choose my career. So right now am pretty sure how and who I want to be in a future that class help me to find out that heal sick people is my passion specially childrens health. Before the elective class my dream was to be a police officer and now my maid is completely change and it was and still being help full to me. Now the electives class are helping me to applied in universities and scholarships .Basically these can happen to more students, there some students who dont know who they are and what they want to be in the future and these electives class can help them at the same way that helps me. However principals should know that is important to help students to find out what passion and accomplish they what to made while they are in high school. In conclusion high schools should let students to choose at least one elective class every year. Elective classes has they own benefit to students. In my opinion I am agree with having the right to choose one class that has to be relative with your passion and your dreams. However they are more different opinions as my opinion,some of them might think that art and drama is what everyone needs to learn about it. But for what I have been through I support those who believes that is fair to choose one or two elective classes.",6,6,5,4,5,5,49,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

In my school we join sports and some after school classes and if we join some sports or some activities after school we have credits and it add up to your grades and people doesnt want to participate because theyre lazy and sometimes they make up stories that the have headache, sick, stomach ache, and just skipping after school classes. And sometimes they fail some classes and teachers wants to convince them to join and stay after class and make their grades up. I have a friend that is a bit of a trouble in school his name is Generic_Name he ask me if I could help him do his work and I said to him that "" You can join activity classes at social studies, or stay after school, and it makes your grades high and you can learn something "" And he didnt followed me, and thats why he still have one F on Social Studies. If I was the principal I would make every students join sports and make them stay after school for those school activities, and if they have like an F in one class or a missing assignment I would call their parents and ask the parents if their child can stay after class and make their bad grades or missing assignment gone and make their grades higher and get extra credits for participating for after school activities. And if I was the student I can convince them by letting students know if they have problems on their work or missing assignments I would let them convince to join the after school activities or stay after to do some retakes on their test or quizzes and figure out what is wrong with their grades and fix them and make their grades high. And those who doesnt want to join the after school activities will remain have an F for the 2nd quarter. The best thing is for the students who want to try or join the team for basketball, tennis, badminton, baseball, hockey, and wrestling is the best thing because few students always wants to join or try for the team. And my two friends join for basketball and hockey my one friend named Generic_Name wants to try out for baseball this spring season and he is really good at basketball and baseball, but the only wrong for him is he has bad grades. I know that students should have good grades before you try out for the team. Generic_Name made a decision to stay after class and do the retakes and after 3 weeks Generic_Name has good grades and he try out for baseball and made the team.\ I agree that students should participate to after school classes or sports. Even me I stayed after school just to finish my work or do some retakes and get a better grade this year.

The first reason, I say that because the students will be more excite to came to the school, they will say, I like to go to shool beacuse, I practice somenthing that I love.

Some people tell me that when I end from high school, I will work in the same jobs, maybe I think the same because my family dont have the money but if the schools have something of academics to know about the jobs, maybe the academic is not free but, is more cheeper than college or the schools have something that we can know about the jobs.

558,1340,982053C6DAD6,"Taking advantage of opportunities at a young age will significantly impact your future abilities of choosing your correct career path. Futhermore, when youre young, you have more time to research about the career that you are interested in. Most teenagers at a young age choose multiple careers of what is most interesting and cool looking to them. Whats very important is that the particular person is willing to pursue in that career. At a younger age, most children get encouraged by their parents to love a specific subject. Nonetheless, depending on the subject that a teenager likes, thatll most likely be the career they pursue. It may also not be the career path they choose since it differs as they grow. When youre at a young age, you tend to gather information quickly, and also learn quicker. Parents make sure that their child not only succeeds in life, but also chooses the carrer they believe is most fit for their desire. Choosing a career may include lots of pressure and thinking. Its always best to talk to your parents for advice, or to speak with your teachers. The parents may sign their child up for activities they think would be identical to their career choice. Most teens would feel that their parents only wanted them to pursue in a career that they have, or from a family legacy as tradition. Nevertheless, its always important to have a young aged teenagers opinion about their career path as well. Teens at a young age tend to become more interested in careers more than adults. Its a fact that a teenagers brain consumes 5X the information quicker then it would if an adult had. Being freshly exposed to a career at a young age benefits the teenager for future desires. Itll give the teenager some time to think about what careers he/she wants to get into, and how she/he is going to do it. When there is a young aged teenager, its best that they gather information slowly, and step-by-step. For example, youtube videos upon the career, games, and movies. Every young adult would prefer some entertainment with a little bit of knowledge, and facts being thrown at them. These activities will satisfy the teenager, and Itll be the introduction to their future career path. Teenagers play an important role in todays generation. It is vital that they should have some experience or knowledge upon what career they want to obtain, and become successful in. High school provides plenty of options for young adults, espesically programs and clubs that they could attend. High schools also provide AP courses, which is an advance placement course. These courses will be a bit difficult, but will benefit the teenager of whichever career they want to achieve. Its always necessary for your teenager to stop by, and speak to his/her counselor once in a while to check up on his/her grades, and how shes doing overall. The counselor will provide him/her the best information needed to achieve the teenagers goal. When providing options to a young age teenager, its best that you make it seem less work as possible. Teenagers most likely wouldnt like the sound of work, and would much rather hear about electronics, or the new clothing line at hot topic. Nevertheless, its an exquisite idea to make sure that a teenager begins choosing his/her career during high school, so they could be more accurate with it once they are old enough. It will give the brain enough time to obsorb all the information they learn, and use it for the future.",8,7,8,8,7,8,2013,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
559,1341,BC0B186645A9,"Living on this planet, everyone has there own character traits. But does everyone create their own characteristic traits or are they influenced by those they surround their selfs with.? John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I take a position on representing that you are in control choosing and creating your own character. In building your own character its all in your mindset. Mindset takes a big part in someones character because it shows what kind of person you are and how you represent your self and how you portray things in life. The way you think has an effect on you as a person and how you betray things in life. It also takes part in who you surround yourself with. Do you surround yourself with people who have goals in their life or inspire you to become a better you.? It also takes part on things you choose to do and say on a daily bases. The decision you make could lead into something better or for the worse in current situations or in the long run. Having motivation and a goal in the your life builds you as a person and sets you for growth. When you see someone in your life not doing well and not in a good current situation you want to avoid being in that position. But when you start seeing someone in your life doing better things and living the life that you want to accomplish, its on your part to doubt yourself or make that you motivation. When you strive for something in life and start working hard for it, your mentality starts to change to do better and get to your goal. Some may argue that the people you surround your self with is beyond your control on how your character traits are formed. Yes the people you surround yourself with everyday might have an effect on your characteristics, but it isnt beyond your control. You can have something to motivate you to be better then who you surround your self with. You have control over your thoughts and how you see things in life. It takes part on you and what you strive for in life. In conclusion, Your own character traits are somethings that come within you and how you portray life. Your character traits aret something that is beyond your control but is something that you can control with motivation and a goal to strive for and it all comes from a strong mindet.

560,1342,161779A176BD,"Many people argue about how there shouldnt be a long summer break because students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. But I do not agree to this argument , because I know that having a long break makes students accomplish more things in life. For example There is many students that have not seen one of their family members in a long time and most of them dont have that time to even say hi to them and why? well because sometimes the schools do not provide a longer breaks and they are so busy trying to focus on school work and get everything done on time that they forget even on their own name. In reality not everyone is going to have things planned for summer break. Theres still students that prefer making their vacation useful. They make they time valuable by taking classes online. And the reason to this is that they might want to graduate early so that they get out of school and maybe have more time to think about their future and what they want to study in college. For me this is a great opportunity to manage time and use it correctly. But even though not all students prefer doing it they still succeed in school and they will accomplish too. Educators say that students are more likely to forget information that they have learned in school after they come back from their good time. And the answer to this is yes thats true but that doesnt mean that all the information goes to waste, because thats why there is technology to help us remember things that we might have forgotten and also their is still teachers that can answer our questions if we have some. And not only the teachers can help, there is so many things were we could get information from like going to the library, asking a friend, asking a teacher , dictionary , and the internet. Another example is that after coming from summer break some students also feel relief because they didnt worried about having to turn in school work or an assignment being late, the main thing that a lot of students hate is, waking up so early and being stressed . But with a vacation they could save some energy they could sleep more and they can relax and enjoy their break. For me personally I dont really like waking up in the morning because of how tired I am with so many assignments that I am not able to rest as much. Sometimes I even fall asleep and wish to get a break from school because I feel so weak and I feel like my brain is going to explode if I do not get a break and thats only going to happened if you never get a break but if you do then you are ready to go and learn. Last but not least students are able to work during summer they could get a part time or a full time job. This would be so helpful for many students that have fees to pay to the school , or just in general. They could get a chance to pay for things that they might need in school and classes or they could work just to get some extra money. After summer break is over they can keep the job for only part time or they could go and focus again in school . To conclude I agree that having a 3-4 week break in the summer , a winter break and a week off spring and fall is the best idea. Because we are like cars if you put gas on them they will take you anywhere youd like but if you dont they will not move until you put gas in it. Same as us if we do not get breaks we will be tired everyday but if you do give us time to relax outside of school we will be more successful and we could accomplish more things. And this is why I believe having a longer break sounds a good idea. ",9,8,9,8,7,8,301,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Some siblings look up one another so it makes them wanna be like their older sister so , they dont get to make their own character. Another reason is the way we treat people.

Some poeple said that graduating early is a good idea becasue students can relive some stress but some student say that is not a good idea because students may miss the best year of thier life. So thinking about it, should you graduate early or not. First of graduating early is a goog idea because of the responsiblity a student have outside of school. Students may have work or some issue that are not school base things. For example my friend had a kid. She graduated early last year, now shes able to go to college or go to work force while taking care of her kid.

Going to school is stressfull enough for students, Exams, Sol, Text, ect. Students use this meated to have a years off school before going to college or going stright to work force, Thirdly.

Students may have a sport team that are able to help they turn into a pro. or a gaming team to turn them a pro. students have a lot of goals in there life also.

Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calories and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday. Parks are good way to study and do school work because it is peaceful and natural sounds help you get relax. Imagine nice sunny day no wind hear of birds and grass bending every direction. Studying in a park will help you a lot because you are not going to get interrupted my neighbors and relatives. People from the park might help you and give you way and strategies to get a good grade on a test. For example Generic_Name want to pass his test. his sibling are loud he cant focus. Generic_Name goes to the community park to study for the big test. In conclusion parks are a good way to do every day activities than staying home being lazy. I hope this helps you with your every day situation.",7,6,8,7,8,8,1750,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Exist a controversy, that is how more we ca have concentration during the assigments in class. I think these thow ways of work , can get a good results. Because working with a group or with ourselves , oneself have the responsability to concentrain and do our work. It is only put us effort to aprove classe. When we working with a group during in class, this are help for us in class to convert more fun. We can share our ideas to do more faster the assignments. Also help to ourselves when one of the group dont usterstand about the topic. Even if the assignment are complete , the rest of the time the members maybe can talk to each other. But this happen also when the students have a good communication and they are friendly. However sometimes can be difficult even the sudents dont try to study with the group or only due the part of oneself. Sometimes is better working with agroup , because when working by oneself taht can be a little frustrate. Students can have support with a group , but when a student working alone is difficult research information without a opion of another person. Working with a group students can be more fiendly with anothers students of differents countries and they can be more caring. Students can show their abilities and be more prepare when they get a job. Also students learn more of the members . In totality this is a argument to the students that they cant work alone , but they have the opcion to work with a group to prepare. In conclusion , I agree that is more better to work with a group in class than alone . It is a benefits to discover new people, hear more ideas, and be fliendly. I think is more helpful to students do the assigments in class. Work alone can be difficult , but sometimes these help oneself to be indepent . It is more great have a goup with members that gonna help. It is only concentration in a group or not , beacsuse oneself need to be more improve everyday and pass classes.

Is not a really good idea, its important to conserve energy, but only in that sense. Because for some students is going to be very boring, and they do not want to going to school, that is why is not a really good idea to change the schedule. First at all, the students will be really upset, because who want to be at school for ten hours. Second, its the same if you come five days per week for eight hours, to come four days per week for ten hours. Third, the business if different than a school, because if a school only open four days per week, are going to be the same if they open five day per week, because the teachers leave one or two hours after the students. The students will be really upsets, because who not to be, nobody want to be at school for ten hours, many students had a part-time job after school, if the school want to choose that option of four-day for ten hours, so the students who has a job.

To have the knowledge of the deeper meaning inside the architecture, and the way to success through my creations. You should select me to visit and learn about architecture.

578,1360,EAEE04B1F712,"Scientist Albert Einstein once said, "" Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree, why do I agree with scientist Albert Einstein. When you use your imagination, you can create it in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it. First, when you use imagination you create it in your mind, you can go to your happy place and just build it you see how its. Your brain helps you imagine it right, for example in the game called Fortnite, you imagine what you want to build before you build it and how its going to look like. In knowledge you just know it you cant make it more beautiful. When you use imagination you can see the problems that might happen when you are trying to build something in your mind. Thats why imagination is more important than knowledge. Furthermore, imagination can help you invent stuff like flying cars. I can use my imagination and and think about what can i do to build a flying car and boom! now you know how you can build it. You need imagination more than knowledge. I am not going to say you cant build flying cars with knowledge but, with imagination you can make it better. Imagination is literary a image in your mind, its like you drawing the things you want to invent on a piece of paper, and just adding some colors to it. In knowledge its like you knowing the answer to a math question or just about any question. Finally, imagination makes the world a better place, how does imagination make the world a better place. Well it has a lot of reasons but the best reason is, it makes people happy if people are happy then there is no violence in the world. If we dont use our imagination there would be no light bulbs or nothing. If you dreamed about something, with your imagination you can accomplish that dream and make your life better, and maybe that dream was you becoming a teacher than youre making your life better and the world a better place. To conclude, scientist Albert Einstein said, ""imagination is more important than knowledge ."" and here is why with imagination you can create in your mind first, you can invent it, you can make the world a better place with it.

Once I failed I told myself to be positve about it and not just give up or get stressed about it and know that I needed to work harder at it. There are people who want to have succes but forget that its not that easy. People have to remember that it takes time and to have patience,and stay positive. Its not easy because that person has to work hard and show effort but even after showing and doing all those things there still can be failure. When somebody fails its better to think about what can be down next time and to try harder after the first try. Anybody could lose confidence or the energy after they keep failing but he or she forgets to see what can be down better next time.

Even if you dont believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It cant hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesnt make sense to try and understand a concept that wont make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I cant grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why its not possible to master difficult problems. Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because its not so much a person cant grow but dont have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement.

582,1364,CAA2C4C4E79C,"Do you think first impressions are impossible to change? Some people say that first impressions are possible to change by getting more in detail. I agree that first impression are impossible to change because first impressions are negative and peoples thoughts dont change. In other words, first impressions are usually negative. For example, if you see a person and he or she just has a serious face, your first impression ""that person has bad vibes. Or a type of food that looks strange to you, you automatically start saying negative things about it. Also, peoples thoughts never seem to really change you will always see that character or thing the same way. Why? Because nothing changes everything it remains if something does change ,it changes in negative way. As an example, people get more cruel or companies start inventing products that shouldnt be together. Your mind wont change unless that person ,place or thing changes in a positive way. So, first impressions are almost impossible to change. First impressions can change by getting more involved and finding more information about that subject but, it is impossible to change that. In the futures lets hope this world and the people and objects in it will change in a postive way so our first impressions can be possible to change.

Reason number one would be Battles and Wars. I believe that losing Battles and Wars help us the united states of america create new weapons wither it was nuclear or bullets.

It sounds crazy and highly dishorroable to are fallen heros who were killed in action, but if we won wars and battles everytime we would soon fall. Because we keep using the same positions and plans in order to win, and we also would feel too confident in wining so we will be using the same weapons over and over again and let the other team discover those new atomic weapons. Reason number two is about automobles. Automobles have been around for a very long time now i guess if my calculations are right its been almost 1,500 years since Henrey Ford showed the world his first ever automoble, the Model T. Henrey Ford had to go through so many people doubting his Model T project would work. Day by day, month by month, even year after years of failed experments. But in the spring of 1830 he successfully got one fully working and running. He had to go through so much walls blocking his path in order to show the world that a automoble was and still is possible. Another example would be Tesla. The famous electronic car company to power there cars with electricity. those guys mustve gone through so many experments that i cant even imagine and the amout of failed ones too and im pretty sure there is alot more failed test projects than passed ones. I say that to be reasonable about it not saying it to make fun of them because if they didnt fail the first time the first modles would have been super crappy, like the cars would suck. Because after every failed project you get new ideas and new imagines of how you want the car to repersent the company and have a good repuation. So if failure wasnt an option for these two companys the cars of 2020 wouldve sucked so much because the company will only car about the money and just send running crappy looking cars that we humans have as a need for work and family. Those are my last two thoughts about failure and Wisten Churchill isnt wrong at all. Without failure succces would feel like nothing like if it was pointless. And we wouldnt live the world we live in today if it wasnt for people back then who didnt stop failing until they reached succesed.",6,6,7,6,6,7,2961,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

For example giving hand and talk about what they can do. The minister Winston, had the responsibility to help others around he, and give enthusiasm to what they can do and how far they can go. Them Lets say on my class my teacher ask to work with others I had to work and show up. For example: lets talk about work in group,help each other giving ideas to we can add on the project. The terms was tried if you fails show up and do cause there is how you can be better. If you make a mistake no problem on other time you can do more better on my opinion there is how the minister can work. In addition there the things can Minister Winston do was talk about with others if they be agree. Because if they do not be agree with the statement was cause they had to know that and see is the achievement work successful too. Now I take the my position on my opinion many people like me came to this country and looking for better opportunities to we dont have in our country. Also we had to learn the languages what is hard but we tried to what we can do and show up how we can be better on the future. But many student had a long history or someone didnt graduated cause many student had to pay rent or thing to whats hard to work after school and dont have to much time to sleep, any ways we had to work hard.

Many people wont grow, for the simple reason that they still live in the past, want to repair a mistake from the past, and miss somebody or something they had before. Is totally true and the reason behind it if we dont let our past go as humans we know that at a certain time those things might come back and probably will hurt us a little bit more than the first time. Living the past is something not easy but we have to understand that there are so many good and bad times in life. That sometimes, whenever something happen to us when get stuck and stop doing what you were doing for that moment . We feel like it will be the ed of the world because once something happen happens we felt like that little mistake will the fine our future but when is not five to six months can pass and we still living in the past. We still living in something that instead for us to stop us it showed us a lesson on how things in life work because we think we cant do anything that will fix our mistakes weve done in life. Repairing certain things in our lives something could be harder than it seems the reason why is we feel weve do many bad things that all we feel inside of if that were guilty for the simple reason that we just dont fin a solution and we feel like weve hurt eve the one around us when probably it was just something that life wanted us to happen to teach us a lesson and learn from it, but we see it on a negative way like if it happen only God knows why this and that happened to me like it was the biggest things of our lives. When people had gotten hurt in the past sometimes is one of those painfullest things because once someone had hurt us we dont socialist with people when thats when also you are hurting people by not talking to them by not doing anything and because at once someone fail to us we dont want to trust anybody for a simple of one person when it shouldn be like that we juts have to learn how to forgive the ones that ave hurt us in he past but we felt like that is not the right thing to do. in all of this three thing we just have to learn how to live with it our past wont define who you are right now or who your are going to be in a few years we just have to learn to live no matter what we all have situation in life that we right felt down at some point but if you fall just get up and continue the race.",5,5,6,4,5,5,1014,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
586,1368,976E2E05C4EB,"Some businesses only work 4 days in the week maybe to conserve energy or maybe to the employers can rest one more day. I think it is a good idea to extending the school day two hours to a four days school week, but one reason that I agree with this opinion is that the student could more time to do their homework and they could work too. The schools could save more energy if we go to school 4 days per week because we used a lot of energy during school day. Many students have babies they have to care them when they are out of school this option can be benefits for this students how have to be parents and students in the same time I love this school where i am because they help the students who do not have who can care their kids. In my point of view this option can help me and the rest of the students too, because we could do a lot of things in that day for example I have to work after school because i have to pay my rent, food, clothes and other things that a person need and If I only came only four day in the week I could work all the day and make more money to help my mom. I agree with the businesses who only open 4 days in the week because they want to save energy and money, For example when i was in mu country my family and I always saved energy because we dont had the money to pay the energy, sometimes I forget to turn off the TV and my mom yelled me and said ""turn off the TV because you dont pay the energy."" and sometimes i get mad because i wanted to listed music and watched TV. Some students have to do many things in the same time for example they have to be parent, student, and labor and the week is to short to them to do all the things and a day off can be so good for them because its not easy to anyone to be responsible. I admire my mom because she was dad and mom for my and my brothers and I was think how can she do all those things and then I realized that she wake up everyday because she want the best for us and doesnt matter how tired she felt. We cant ""never give up"" because fighting. In conclusion, I agree that the schools extending the school day two hours and we came only 4 days on the week because sometimes we feel tired and we can rest one day in the week because we have to work in the weekends too and the school can be beneficial too because they can save energy, food, water, money and a lot of other things.

Some students may need time to do homework, go places that take a long time, or just make up time to study. If schools were to add more time the students would not get enough sleep because they stayed up late studying for a quiz, test, or just homework causing the students or the other classmates to sleep during classes Second, it would affect the mental health of the students. Making them stress out over knowing that they would have to wake up early and be dismissed late. Third, the education time of some students may be cut short.

Famous people like their fans sometimes they are under 12 ages. if the persons did not given to the new generation good example they can not be influencing good things in them. The parents they are the best example for their sons, and daughter at home. Because at home sometimes is the first school for our child that can has, there we learn speak, walk, and who clothing you. Example: if her father is a drunk, and smoker what is a example him given to his sons. That would by influencing in her sons and can destroy the future of them. This situation happen in many family and children start to have problem with the authority. And is the bad example that their parents given to them . And is no only the things the parents give to her sons nevertheless they need more then a example, more then things like expensive clothes. and shoe many of them they need a parents that care of them.

Some students do not really use their cellphones for educational purposes but use it as an excuse to wonder off and get distracted with it. Students should not be granted permission by any teacher to use their cellphones in class, it is a mistake. A major distraction now a days is social media. Instagram,Snapchat, and Youtube have impacted the lastest generations. When teacher allow their student to use their phones most of them at times just login into instagram or snapchat. It can easily be proven by the amount of students that come after class and tell their teacher they could not complete their classwork. Social media can be a weapon in and out of school , it will distract students from their work. Social media isnt the only distraction a student can have from completing class work. Ive notice that student at my high school download these new games on their cellphones. When a teacher of mine tells us to pull out our cellphones to do some research, I see more than half the class flip their phones and start to play this new game called Fortnite. This game is very addictive that those students who decided to play when asked to do research, their grades dropped straight down to a failing grade. This is why allowing students to use their cellphones can be a mistake,they are failing their courses. Texting youre friends during class is the last distraction for a student. Students during class mightve been waiting for so long to text their freinds back. Most of the times its really not more of a ""hey"" or ""how are you doing?"". Students really have long conversations and get carried along that they forget what they were asked to use their cellphones for. High schoolers are always just on their phones texting one another and wait until last minute or the last day a assignment is due.

596,1378,F8FE459205F4,"Do you agree with churchills statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Should i agree that when someone fail and if they continuo doing what they were doing they will success later on? Im agree because when you make mistakes youll learnd from it, and next time when you do it you will be better than what have you done in the past. If you are a failure and if you keep trying then im proud of you because thats the mean that youre in the good path and that youll achive your goals soon. My reasons are nobdy is perfect and no one will be perfect ever, my second reason is even famous people have fail and now theyre in the top, and my tird reason is there are some people who like to accomplish their dreams by working hard and never letting other people stop them. To start with nobody is perfect, is because we all can make mistakes and also because it is okay to make mistakes, no one had died because they fail doing something like work from school or stuff from work. So it is like when you go to other country and you have to try new things like their languge, their food. their traditions and all the stuff that their country have and I konw that sometimes to feel like youll never be like them, youll never understand what they are saying, but it is false because I am a immigrant, I came to the United States when I was 14 years old not knowing any english, with only one person by my side that was my mom, and leaving everything behind. For one moment I think that I was never going to get used to this country, that I was never going to understand english and that I was never going to be enough to this country but now I can say that I can speak english I can writte in english and that all the people (brothers,and sister) that I left behind I still love and that someday I will returned and I will tell them everything. To continuo with famous people had failed in their past, and im saying this is people I know that to be where they are now they have done alot of work and theyve done alot of sacrifices too like leaving their family behind because they did no support them or maybe because they didnt like that profession, friends becuase some of them are fake or maybe because they want to help them to progress, maybe schools need to be more focus about they work like wrinting songs or even focusing more in their dance, works because you need to choose the one that you like more, and I can tell that it did not stop them, they keep fighting to be better each day to give all the best about them to have a mentality about progress. Ive seen alot of famous videos about people that I like and ive cried because some of their stories are really sad and I know what they where feeling that time. You can follow famous people and i admire them because they have fail millions of time and theyve never stop doing what they love to do. To finallice with that if you are one of those persons who like to accomplished dreams then you should never give up because thats what looser (mediocre) people do, they give up when they see that something is hard or maybe because they are shy about them how they look like if they are pretty or no or maybe because they dont like their work because the people is mean or their managge is agressive in the term how he express so they decide to quit. We always tried to put the best and to be the best of us even when you know that you can fail, that there are other people that are good too but you tried and you put effort on it so if you fail youll know that you win because to did it and you finished it. You never can think that you are a failure if you didnt win, you can see that you are good in some other things where other people is no good. You will always have options you can choose if you want to tried hard or if you dont. To conclude I am strongly agree that failure plays in the pursuit of success because nobody is perfect and if someone wants to be perfect then theyll need alot of work, we also know that even famous people have fail so if they have fail we should fail too beause then we will see what we had done wrong and we can fix it, and also even when it means that you need to leave that people that you love behind. Furthermore even though sometimes it takes a little too long to notified how much we have success and because we dont see that, were mad with our lifes, we think that if we dont have a good possition at our work is because were not good enough but it is not truth because they are some people that doesnt have work or some others supplies and were complaining about our possition at work. It is not fair to have that kind of mind because we all should be happy with what we have and with what we can affort. Furthermore been a failure doesnt mean that you dont know how to do something or that you can not win.

Today people can do a lot of things using technology, but there are some good and bad effects that technology cause on peoples lives. Technology can cause bad effects and there are some people that they can see what is technology causing and they just prefer to continue using technology. Technology need limitation for humans. Although some people says that technology had positive effects on peoples lives, actually technology can have negative effects on peoples lives because technology cause addiction to peoples. Addiction to technology is a big problem in the world. Some people believe that technology doesnt cause negative effects on peoples lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on peoples lives. First reason, why does technology had negative effects on peoples lives is because technology cause a lot of problem on peoples. One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology . Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents. The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on peoples lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They cant stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks. In conclusion technology had negative impact on peoples lives. Technology have to have supervision because it is causing a big impact in the world. The are some positive effects that technology cause, but the majority are negative effects. Some people want to stop technology and there are some that they just want a better world without problems and addictions to technology.

598,1380,3DCF3E6F4A13,"Well most students enjoy summer vacation because was one of the most beautiful station in the year for one all of students, they enjoy with the families, friends that things in the summer, though some teacher say the summer break is too long and that students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. I think that summer is one of the most special station or period because you share more with your Family, Friends, and all students have merit to share more with the most important persons in their lives because a lot of our parents working 10 to 12 hours of Monday to Saturday in sometimes Sunday too, and they dont have a lot of time to share with they families. In my case, I love when its summer vacation because I have a lot and good experiences with my Family, with God when left to the house our going to different places, I feel that is these period is when I share more with my mom, She is the most important person in my life, she is who are always with me in the good and bad things, she is who give me advice every day about the good and bad things to not make that things that I dont need to do and dont pass for a lot of things that she pass when she was young, I love these time of summer because is when I pass more time with my mom and she help me to be better every day in my School, Work, Church and everywhere that going. The mother is one of the most important person what I have in my life because she is who always are in there for me and help to always be good person, good in my school and a lot of more things. And I have beautiful experiences with God and these is that I love more is to pass my time with God because I learn more about things important and that help my life. I think the 2 months that all students have to summer is a good time because are pass like 9 months in school and these is too much because sometimes you want to make something but school is to difficult and that people cant to share with special people. Well when the educators or teachers say that summer vacation is too long because student do not retain the information is not true because the students retain these information about Works, Projects, Homework, Classwork the information is in our Brain, Mind, are that things important and basic. I dont agree that person argue should be year-round and that only have 3-4 weak breaks in the summer is like only one month and you cant enjoy and make your summer funny with you parents because you are thinking in school, I dont be agree with these the summer is when you can pass more time with your important person because there is the period when they have the vacation to, I thing the summer is for enjoy and pass a funny time with your Mom, Father, Brothers, Sisters, and all your Family. I say that is good to have 2 months and like 2 weeks of vacation because you clearing you Mind, you dont thing in a lot of Homework or Works of School. I have one experience in my life when I were in Generic_City that only thing that I have in my MInd was Homework, Projects, Presentations in my School, Programs of my School and one day my family say I want to going to share with all and I say I cant go because I have a lot of work to do and I need to finished and my uncle say Generic_Name is time to share with your family, is time to you clearing your mind about school and I say another time I need to finish my works about school and all my family going to share and I stay in my house working in all my projects of school and I sit in my room, I was thinking you loss beautiful time with my family for to make my works, and I say is time to you share more with your family because your family in every moment stay there. Everything the specific moment when you have time with share with your family, friends share because you dont not in what moment you can loss your Mom, Father, Brothers, Uncle, Sisters, Aunt, Cousins, etc, when is time to school make all your works in time. Dont take you Education like obligation, taken like one of the opportunity to be better. In some moments you have difficult time but you need to continue, to be stronger, the education is where you learn more about the all things Human, Animals, Solar System, H2o and a lot of things important what help you life in the future you learn things what in your future you can put in practice, you can teaches another person that need to know more. For everything have time, your Family, Works, Friends, School all these things depends about you, for these reason I think When is time to school is school, When is time to your family is family. So you need to think and put your agenda in order to you make the important things in order so right now I change a lot of things in my life and these it is the Monday to Friday to be concentrate in my Education, Saturday to Sunday in God and my family, when its time to pass with my family I pass time with my family and now I share more. And for these reason I think the summer vacation is important because a lot of students dont have their parents in here maybe live 8 hours, 10 hours in when its vacation they going to pass time with their Parents. You need to be have the order in your life you need to make time for everything. The Education is important because is where you learn things important but most important for me is my family because they can one day no be in here in the Earth because they dead. And I think when its summer vacation the Educators or teacher enjoy to their vacation and pass good time with their family and when its time to come back to school review somethings because not everything forget somethings are in the brain that only need to do is to review. Then the summer vacation are so good 2 months and 2-3 weeks to you enjoy with all the persons important and special to you, so enjoy and pass a funny summer vacation. So enjoy, teachers dont thing the summer is too long because is a shorter period that one student have for vacation, teacher enjoy vacation!!.",4,5,7,6,5,6,797,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

First students should decide on what activities they will be interested in because parents or guardians can support their children.

Which would eventually result into a more bright and smart teens who would feel more comfortable to face the real world.

601,1383,DD66EBC605D1,"Some schools offer the option of attending classes by ""online"" or ""video conferencing"". This may not be a good idea because how does the student going to get responsible? or how can the teachers know if the student is not cheating on a test?. Is there any benefit to know is this option is going to help the student phsychlogy, mentally or physically?. Education is too important! And a better way of learning is by attending to SCHOOL! The way as many people done it. Also, by this way attending to school students might join in sports, activities, etc. It gives more benefits and helps to refresh your mind. School gives classes of ""PE"" which is important because doing sports is healthy. In 2015, a student at Generic_School took the option to attend classes by online because the student was not a ""social"" person which means the student did not like to communicate. But after all the student did regret it. The student noticed that communication is too important because is part of education and how to success in life. The words of the student to advice the students were "" There is no more benefits than attending to school. School does help you to your knowdlegde and prepare you for your future. Did not like the fact of waking up too early and to deal with all those people every single day, but here is the thing as people we cannot avoid people. It does affect you plus It does not make sense at all. Why? because WE ARE THE PEOPLE. What I learned by taking this option and what made me regret it was : We are the community, we are the voice of the world and as a group working together we can make big changes and a better society as well. And classes from home by the way online or video conferencing, this does not give you ""P.E"" classes and doing sports is wealthy. So by now attending to school is the best option for everyone."" The student had excellent grades, scholarships, made new friends than he expected to have. Where is he now by making the best option? He is now at SCHOOL_NAME preparing for his major as a lawyer. He became an example for many students that have the same issues as he had. As an immigrant this is a real big request, they must attend classes by going to school. It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different systems programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will. In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.

602,1384,6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go. In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and theres no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you shouldnt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective dont get involved as much as your other friends is. Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people dont like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials. In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students dont have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. Its just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to Kings Dominion and once your there you well be like Ive earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something thats giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view Im working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do. Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they dont because were a family and something we always say when were down is dream, believe, achieve . This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also youre parents and family . In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you dont have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

I dont think working from home is a good idea for school students. There are some kids that cant really work at school, but then theyre others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later.

606,1388,A91E59572DA0,"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays. When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a new friend, to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media. In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge. Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. Its true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what its true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and its neccessary to learn how to manage them. A solution for this problem could be in the parents hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kids future. After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, its important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldnt let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more.

Also when am in class i dont like when teachers or student start asking me question where i am from or what do i like to do. or sometime i like to work when the place is quiet because i can focus more and the place is quiet i can do my work in peaces. Also i like to have my personal bubble because i dont like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that i do not know or when they give me a attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when the happen i will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometime i cannot control myself. when the work in a group i like to work with people that wont talk to much and we do our own work. Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion. I like to be my own personality because i know what i am doing and i am doing because i like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they dont how i am or that way i dress or look. And i cannot be a other type of person who i am not because i will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because i am acting different or look different for other people to think i am like that. Also if you think we are friends and you start to get conferees around me and you start talking about your life i am just going to walk away because i didnt ask you about your life because i am not interesting in your life because if i did i probably would ask you but if i didnt ask that mean i really dont care what do you do or what do you like. If i dont like you you better understand i wont be nice to you and i wont try to have a conversation with you. Or event class class if i am not talking with anyone the mean i dont want yall to talk to me or if i dont like the teacher i just keep my distance but if the teacher i dont like and she/he come at know where an start yelling at me i wont stay quiet and i will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face an start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problems with me and i didnt know at about it. It is so ease if you respect me i will respect you back because if you come at mo where an start saying stuff to me and i really dont know what is going on i swear will disrespect you and say a lot stuff to you because you came to me saying stuff and every time that happen i really dont care if i hurt you or i hurt your feeling. If you leave me alone we probably we be cool and we wont have any issues with each other. Been around people is not my type stuff i like to do i just rather to be alone and do my own stuff but if need help would ask someone who i think they know just go to the internet and try to found what i need online. Because i dont like to bother people just to do it or try my best to guess in the answer.,5,4,6,6,5,4,2633,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Everyone should know what he/she want to be so they must prepare them selves for what they need to be, like working hard in order to achieve development in there ways. I want to tell about my friend Generic_Name that he is an engineer, he use be one those people that they think they cant do any thing in lives to find the way of success but he went for it to get it, thats way he is an excellent example for me. That makes me feel like it is your life, it is your choices just find it out whatever you want. I think whoever believed to themselves and to the ability that they have they defiantly feel more strong in there goals. Also every one knows that when you have a problem do not complain just ask for help like me, when I was in Tenth grade I had a lot of issues the most important one is the school that I dont want to be in school because I feel that is just not going to work for me but I was wrong because I did ask for help from my teachers they provide me very helpful in formations. Some people might disagree with with me because they think asking for help cant solve all of the problems, but they are wrong because everyone need help no one is prefect. As we know to confide in your self you need to toil hard a lot and you must tolerate more trouble that they are coming in your way. Of cores noting is easy but also is not that much hard that you should give up for it, so the more education that you have the more happier you will be in the future like my favorite soccer player Ronaldo he had a very hard live but he did find his goal and now he demonstrated him self to everyone. In conclusion whoever try to do something in the lives like working hard on there goals, having enough confidence and tried to achieve them they well be successful.

614,1396,6BFDA0FE1CB2,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""to be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" I strongly agree. Have you ever felt like you have to be someone else you are not? This is something that most people who living in this world are dealing with. Us human being live in a world nowadays that is actually dont want us to be ourselves, no matter how hard we try, we most likely end up not being confident, and having low self esteem. we think that we have to be someone else to please our society, which is not very true. Therefore fighting with this world to be ourselves is one the greatest accomplishment because, people become more confident, they get the chance to be their real selves, and they dont try to please others. Firstly, people become more confident. No matter how good a person can look, having no confidence fade the beauty away. No confidence make people look weak and they dont believe much in themselves. As an example, some people may have terrible stuttering problems, and sometimes it may make them feel like not wanting communicate with others, or some people would love to have a conversation, but they might think that they are going to get laughed at because its hard to get their words out. However fighting this obstacle can improve their lives and build them up to have more confident. This is one reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Secondly, people get a chance to be their real selves. Some people get lost trying to be someone else that they are not because the society want to change them. For example, in some countries, especially my country, Haiti, people get bullied for being in the LGBT community. Some parent, family members, or friends might not accept them for who they really are, so they have to hide it and try to be normal like every body else. Sometimes some of them feel like they are getting rejected by the community and they just to want to be alone crying or even want to commit suicide. This is a major reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. Lastly, people dont try to please others. Some people would do absolutely anything to please their significant others or their friends. As they pleasing them, they end up making that person happy and automatically forget about their own happiness, which is not right. For example, some people might have abusive boyfriends/girlfriends who want them to do everything their way. Deep down inside they dont really want to, but they probably love that person and they have to do it if they want to please them. They end up falling in an awful situation that may even risk their lives. This is a last reason why I agree being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. As a summary, be yourself in a wold that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. you become more confident. you get the chance to be the real you. You do not try to please others. If people keeps being themselves in this world that just want them to be someone else, then they would find themselves where theyve lost it and they would also find happiness.

615,1397,222D14189E1F,"Imagine that the school plans to add more time at school. I disagree of the schools adding more time because it would be irritating,boring,stressed. and kids do not want that to happen. The children wants to have a normal school day. And they have to prove that they can do it,they believe in their self. First,It is boring because they want to have fun. And the reason why it is a lot of fun because they want to have a good time. And thet can think about what they want,What do they want to do when the schools are thjnking about staying more longer at school. For example, Generic_Name went outside to play after school. Secondly,it is stressing because they would be crazy about it. And the reason why it is stressing because the blood of the brian would get bad. It would be horrible that they have blood pressure,haert attacks,and they want to kill there self. They cant do that,but they can protect there self. For example,Generic_Name was taking a test but she got nervous,Frustrated,lonly and upset. Thirdly,it is irritating because kids will get tired and dizzy at school. the reason why its because their body do not have enough energy. For example,My best friend Generic_Name studied for a test,but she got tired. In my opinion it is not ok that a lot of people get injured. And it is going to be difficult but it is worth a try,I want a lot of people to be happy,not injured,not feeling down and feel better about whats going on,or what is doing. In closing,I disagree that the school plans to add more time at school. And it is a bad idea,It would get irritating,boring and stressed. In my opinion it is better for kids so they can not worried about it. And it would be easier step by step and keep going,Dont stop doing it. I really think that it would be better if the school would not have bullies,bad teachers back in the day because a lot of teachers back in the they hit children because sometimes kids do not behave and teachers think that the kids deserved it and i think that The kids do not always get the right answer but In my opinion all teachers are different because some teachers are nice,hardworking,sweet,mean,not inappropiate aswell. And The teachers that i had or have from kindergarden to first grade,second grade,third grade,fourth grade,fifith grade,sixth grade,Seventh grade and 8th grade theyre nice,helpful,caring too and thay dont hit us. They protect us,And i want for other kids have the same exciperence that i have. And i want other kids or other people or everybody to be happy and protected too.

616,1398,CF290C0884F0,"To conserve the energy and resourse, we do not should have to work a four-day for week. Some jobs, work during the week, and others in the weekend days. We can not conserve it much of the resourse or energy even they give four days of work, because some workers do their jobs in the week days, others will do it in the weeekend days. This is because there are a lot differents types of jobs, that do not permit they to work only in the week days. Add to more hours its not make a diference because some job are in the night, some in the mornings.. Most of the people they have off and want to go outside to have fun or go to a restaurant have dine, some bussines have to be open in this days that the people have off and want to do something in the weekend day. In my position I dont think we conserve the energy and resourse doing in a four-day work week. Its have to be nesesary that the businesses have people working and open their bussines the 7 days, to those people who go to their businesses. Schools must dont have to chanche the five days to four days in the week. Students can adopted the two hours more but, they will be have three days to spend their time. One reason why I will be desagree if the system want to change the schedule of the schools is because its going to affect most of the students, since they dont have a job and will be pass must of the time in their fhones, using the internet, social media, wathing tv or playing video games. Students will be doing nothing productive in their lifes doing this we will waste most of our time. This will be affect in our lifes, I take a position in this situation because I am a students and I know the students hobbies what we like to do, what not and how we wasting our time. However to add two more hours in the workers scheddule. It can be good for some of them because they dont have towork 3 days, but also going to affect most of the workers, that are parents. Most of the parent can not aply to work the week days. Suppose they aply for work the 4 days, but can be diferents days like their are a lot jobs that have diferents schedule. Monday to Friday, Sunday to Thursday, or Wednesday to Monday. Schools also chanching the schedule, parents will be have to pay for babysitting for those who have kids. Not all people have a government job the require only work the week day and weekend days off. Most of the businesses ask to work 5 to 6 days and which its not have to be Monday through Friday. Also we can see its imposible to change to the four-day to conserve the resourses even people work 4 days. People have to work between the 7 days, some have to work 4 days and when this people have off the other half have to work that days because businesses can not be close the 7 days. People must will have to work even diferents day. In conclusion for me it is not a goog idea to change the schedule of the students, to a four-day, when they have 5 days. Students can do more work in school and learn more and develop their knowladege passing more time in the school. Can be good idea for the people who work because they can have rest more time with family, or doing hobbies. Work 10 hours its good for those who will have off 3 days, but not for students because students have to develop in school more time.

617,1399,62B3C9C3398E,"Do we have to live other people experiences? If we want to live our own life you should start by taking a break. Think how people would like to live their lifes and then, use this as an example but do not use it for your own. We all know that life isnt easy as we want but thats life, we cannot change it. If you put your life in hands of an expert you will have the opportunity to succed but it will feel strange and you will regret later. Why? if you ask why, and this is because everything you have done its thanks to someone else not to you, you are not living your own life, youar not having fun, no mistakes, no experiences, no control of your own life. Theres always going to be a person telling you what to do and if you dont follow his/her directions something could go wrong. Thats why you should live your life as you want to live it without anybody help. At first, you can have a teacher during a period of time but it doesnt mean that you will have to go and ask for help everytime you have a problem. Make your own decisions mean that you will do mistakes but you will learn even more from this and it will help you to do thigs better and it also will help you like a human. When I said human I mean that you will have your own thoughts about something and your own way to live your life and no like a robot that just follow direction and have no sense of humor. People will never discover their great mental power because until I know they just develop the 70.3% of their mental capacity and it makes them feel useless sometimes. I dont really like to talk about other people life but one example could be Homeless people. Everyone thinks and look at the as a piece on somethings useless but if you really meet them and talk to them you will realize that they are smart and all they do and what they have in their brains is even better than what we have. The way they think and the way they look at other people make them specials and unique. Now, what can experts do to change their life or take the control of what they want to do?. As we all know, they cannot do anything and no matter what the situation could be the answer will be the same. Their decisions and their style of life before the actual I think were made by someone else and after a while they were not able to pay for what they had. Experts help you to get things but do you really think they will help you when you are really on trouble? or will they help you with things you have to pay? the answer to this is NO. In my opinion they help you because they want something from you or they will try to get something from you after you learn it. Two years ago I met an old man from Washington DC, his name was Generic_Name. His parents are from Generic_City and Generic_City. Before homeless he was a mechanic but one day while he was fixing a car he met a person who told him that he could help him to have his own workshop and he accepted. Everything was good for the first years but after some years the person left the country and Generic_Name didnt have the capacity to manage the whole store. Bussiness came down, deppression started to make him use drugs, and after a while he lost everything he had and the expert (person who help him) wasnt there to help him when he really needed him. If you think you have the capacity to succed on your own, you have to do it and dont let anyone ruin what you have planned for your own future. It doesnt matter if he is a proffesional, you just need to learn what you need but never let them maneuver your life. People will always try to control your life but you are the one who is going to decide if you want to live the life they want you to live or the one you want to live. I am not saying that you have to ignore the advices they give you but dont follow their directions. Nothing is difficult if you really try it and nothing can be impossible if you really want to do it. Do not live like a robot, dont let anyone take adventage of your incapacity to succed just because you do not know anything. Ask questions, ask for advices and opinions but dont do want they want to do with your life. I know life isnt easy to live but remember that we just have one and after death we cannot do anything about it. Life is going to beat you up, experiences will make you stronger every single day, decisions will make you be independent, and at the end you will see that everything you did was good and you have what you wanted without anybody help. My friend, if you let people maneuver your life, then you will cry and you will not have the future you wanted. Everything will be destroyed and disgrace will follow you anywhere. Dont follow experts, be one of them and do your own life, have a family, have a car, an partment or whatever you want to have without asking anyone. Help is given by God when you born. He gave you two arms, two legs, two eyes and a body. A person help you to walk and talk and one time you learn this you become an indepentent person. Do everything by yourself and dont let people make you feel useless because God make them the same as you and as everyone else but they have not develop their mental capacity the waht make them special. If you do everything by yourself people will try to destroy you but be strong and try even more until get what you want. Never try to kill yourself if you dont know what to do it is better if you believe in God and in his help because he is the only one who can help you without taking anything away from you. Never give up and follow your dreams, live your life as you want to live it but remember that no one can control what you can do if you dont want to. Life depends of you and what you do with it. No matter what happen you have to do what makes you happy always just trusting God. Remember that just God and family are our friends. Anyone else is just people we know.

If people fail and grow up without losing hope, they can be successful in their future. Although some people thought failure is not good for their life, nevertheless, some were thought failure plays an important role in their life, because, it makes them to learn more about themselevs and become successful in their life. Failure can make people to learn more about their self. Because after failing, people can know themselves better than before. They can know about their strength and weakness. For example, Generic_Name told her friend that she is good at Science and English. But she said she is not good at math. For that, she dont like to do math at home or do it by herself. She always copied from board in classroom. Because she never try to do it. Suddenly, one day in her math class, she was called by her teacher to solve a math in board. First she was saying that she doesnt know how to do it. Fortunately after looking at the question, she did it. And then after this, she got to realize that she know how to solve the equation problem. Which makes her feel confident about math and herself. While she was talking, one of her friend interrupted her. And said that, he was satisfied with her math. Unfortunately, she failed one of her test, which makes her feel bad. After test correction, she got to understand what she missed. So she prepared herself for retake and she took the test second time and then she pass the test on second time with a good grade. Some people who fail on first time can also prepare themselves for next time. Which can take them one step ahead of their goal. Furthermore, failure can make people successful in their life. To become successful people have to have positive enthusiasm. For example, Generic_Name is senior of Generic_School. In order to graduate she need to pass her English SOL. Because when she was a junior, she didnt pass her English 11 SOL. But this time she tried her best with positive energy and she didnt gave up. As a result, she pass her English SOL this time. Some people also cannot reach their goal in first time. But that doesnt mean, they never can be successful. To reach a goal, people need to pass the small steps first. If they fail, they can try their best for second time. And always there is a second option for every problem. For to become success, people need to learn from failure and they have to try again and again. And then they can become successful on thier life. Overall, without loss of enthusiasm people can reach their goal by failure. People can successfully reach in their goal if they learn from failure. From failure people can learn more about themselves. And people have to have positive energy and hope to handle any situation.

I told him that yes I do have test tomorrow, then he give me an advice that you should not play any video games tonight because video games can make you tired, bored, and cant think about your question in the test. When I thinked to myslef that if I play video games, I will not be able to think on my test the next day of it. I recommend to ask good people fo an advice. Secondly, the person will find their next step. I have exprience that when I dont find my next step, I would ask for advice from other people. Once, I did not know how to do my next step my math assighnment. I asked my friend that should I multiplie or add, she showed me a trick for an easier way to always find your step when you are stuck on that kind of question. I likly use that trick trick, and I mostly find my step. I recommend that a person will have to ask for advice if they even know the answer. In addition, there was a time that my sister had a problem with her next step. It was an important assighnment so I didnt help her but, I give some advices and that helped her a lot to, fix her step thet she was stuck. I will say that a person should ask people for an advice. Lastly, the person will stop thinking about their choice too much. I have expreinced it when I think about my choice so much. Once, I had a choice that I could take the Mock writing SOL or I could get the original and a higher level writing SOL. I always thinked which one should I go for, and one day I was angry for no reason and that was because of how much I thinked about which one I should go with. I asked my dad about this and he said that you should take the original because this is a challenge for you. Additionally, I said to myslef that if I get this writing SOL and if I pass this, my parents ahould give at least a gift and I said to my dad that this challenge is great. Again, I recommend people to ask advice from someone to know and research more about something. In conclusion, people somtimes talk to more than on person because they will be able to know which is the best choice to go with, to find their next direction, and that person will have to extract his thinking about their choice too much. Consenquently, I would always recommend to ask an advice from a person you know or knows the best.",7,6,7,8,7,6,1311,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
622,1404,B8AD03895BE6,"I disagree with school the board of adding one an half hour each day to school. Students would have more class work like math or home work. Students would have more drama each day at school. Also, students have other thing to do for example they might have to go see their family. Having a extra half an hour would not be good for the school because students would not be focus in class. First, students would have more class work. They, would have more projects, more class work students would have a hard time focusing when doing their class work. Students would have a hard time with home work or studying. For instances many of the students would have to study after they did class work they would not want to study in the mean time they would want to take a break. Students would not like to have in extra half an hour. Second, students would have more drama every day at school because of the extra half an hour. Students would go around the school an start drama every where then, students would have a hard time focusing in class. Then, their grades would start going down. Although having an extra half an hour would have many problems students would most likely have more drama then ever before. Lastly, having an extra half an hour students would not like having it because students would be messing thing, such as football games, soccer games maybe even a cook out at the park with their family. Having an extra hour would not be so good because students then, would be messing the thing they do not want to mess. Having an extra half an hour would then be a problem because it would be more work, drama and other thing. Many students would most likely not like having extra school time because they have other thing to do. Also having the extra half an hour would change every thing students then, would not have time to do the thing they like to do like going to their friend house or play outside, because of the extra half an hour. In conclusion having the school board plan to add one an half hour to the school each day would mean that students would not want to come to school. Because, of the extra half an hour students would have to wake up in the morning and thing about the school extra half an hour and students would have more class work, study more for a subject. Then, students would start drama at school then, students would not be focus in class. Also having more time in school students would then mess other thing beside school.

With the use of technology daily affect peoples vision, with the time people use glasses. Secondly, people became antisocial with the use of technology because, people prefer to spend their time on the internet than having a conversations with their friends. People use to have communication with others by the technology instead of hangout or doing any activities with them. The majority of the people prefer to shop online, and lost their time thinking if the clothes is going to fit them, instead of go to the store, try the clothes on and see if is a good idea to spend the money. Finally, the use of the technology is less helpful and have a negative effect on peoples lives because, the technology take people out from the real world, for example if people shop online and they have questions they have to wait to long to get their answers, but if they were at the store a worker would help them.

624,1406,0E3C1F059C31,"Technology is the best way to contact your family members . For example in emergency and on special occassions like religous holidays , birthdays, anniversary, wedding that you didnt have time to attend . Also you can contact them if some one far away from you is in the hospital or someone died in your family you can contact one of your family maembers to see what is happening at the house at that moment. Also You can play games on your phone or listen to music while you are going some where in the car or in the airplane. Also you can order food from your favourite restaurante to eat at home or at the hotel you are satying at. Therefor you can check out books from your phone and read from your book on your phone. also you can book a hotel room from the technology now days or you can also take pictures and send them to your love ones. Another example can be that where ever you are in the world you can order anything from online store. Like makup kits, dresses or other things from the online store. Also you can purchase movie tickets , zoo tickets or you can go on a cruise with family. Also you can purchase tickets to travel to your dream country and do fun stuff there. Technology is also bad , because what ever you post on social media it will go everywhere and everone would see what are you doing and what are you up to basically the photos you take of yourself and you post it on social media the people are going to see it and it probably hurt you future career or your job that you are in. Also technology is bad , because people out there are literlly photshoping what ever you post basically girls , because they do inpropreate things with the photos of girls. Another example of why is technology is bad. Its bad , because of cyberbullying. People bully other people on social media and the people who are getting bullied cant do anything ,because the people who are doing bullying. they dont know who they are if the people who are getting bullied said something to the bully they will do something wrong with them. So thats why technology is good and bad try to avoid these things lif you want to post something out there just be aware of those people who do all these kind of things like cyberbulling and photoshopping.

There are many types of resources such as money, products, and energy power. Factors that have supported the human life for long time, and actually continue it happening. Every body in this world must be career it, because these resources are helping us to survive ,and support our life style. But the sad-reality is that the human does not career it, because they do not know about the consequences or they are ignorant. We need to rectify our mistake, and keep safe our resources. This written will be about advice, benefits, disadvantages, and plans how career our resource. Let talk about the benefits that we are go to get if we safe our resources. First, there is a plan or recommendation what is about adopt a four-day work week, with each days 10 hours work, and school days with two hours. This is as a way to save our resources, and obtain the following benefits; we are going to save the energy, food,internet, water, time (to spend in our life with the family or whatever we want), the deterioration of our clothes and shoes.

For this time I am go to talk about the disadvantages, if we implement this project. There will be present many problem such as the loss of time to learn, time to work, we will lost our social life in the school as in the work, became a professional will be harder and tardy. The technology advance will be slower, and it is go to affect the human evolution. Then we will lose many important things, and resources. Factors that could support in life, and make it easier. In conclusion, There will be many people whom will benefit from this project , but at same time it is go to make many problems cause the disadvantages. If we implement this plan, we must be able to understand, we are go to take our risk. Moreover we must be think about the risky that this could be, and prevent more problems than we already have. I recommended do not waste our time anymore, starting to create a better world with a better life style, and creating new project to save resources. This support or this type of project need to be created by the government, because they are whom have the power to control whole country. Now take career our resource became a new goals for me after reflect a topic as this.

628,1410,D0CC47FFC293,"To have a good life we need to have a good way of think, it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. Im agree with that statement because a positive attitude make you a better person, and makes your life easy, with a positive attitude your been optimistic and that is very importan during hard times in life. There are a lot of importants reason why it is important to have a positive attitude. A positive attitude is the key to succes in life because you will have a good relationship with people. People like to be around a person that has a good attitude and is optimistic because they know that you are always going to try to help others and you are going to keep a good attitude during adversities, also if you have a good attitude people will know that they can count on you. You can give people good advices as well as a constructive opinions. Conversly if you have a negative attitude you are going to transmit a bad energy, and people will stay away from you. Thats why is very important to have a good attitude because you are going to be surround with people that has a positive attitude too. Also a positive attitude is important because it will help you to solve problems easily. If you are calm and keep a positive attitude during problems you will find a better solution for problems. If you are positive you will try to think in a way to solve the problem without stressing too much. Also if you have a positive attitude you will not give up easily during hard times. People who have a negative attitude always struggle when solving problems, because they think that maybe the problem does not have solution or if it has is to hard to solve it. Negative people always focus on the bad side of things thats why it is very hard for them to handle problems. Thereby is important to keep a positive attitude, no only because it will help you, but also because you will be more happy. Another reason why is important to have a positive attitude and why I think is the key to succes in life is because I have seem that people who have a positive attitude are more happy than people that have a negative attitude because they stress for little things that happen , positive people are always trying to see the good side of things, they know everything that happen, happen for a reason and that everything has solution, we just need to look for a way to solve it. People with positive attitude always make better choices than someone negative. For example; The majority of the people with negative attitude give up when they dont reach what they want instead of strive their goal. Largely people with positive attitude always keep going and fighting for their goals until they reach it. In conclusion a positive attitude is very important to be successful because, it will help you to make a strong relationship with people. Also it is important because you will always find a way to solve conflicts, if you keep a good attitude you also are going to make good chices. You are going to be happier and live peaceful because you are not going to stress about everything .

A finial reason why an extra hour shouldnt be added is because after school courses will be longer, this will be a issue for after school buses because they will have to change their whole schedule for picking up students in the afternoon.

But than I realized that soccer isnt very popular in America. So than i started playing football and I enjoy playing that sport very much. Since than Ive always imagine of being a professional football player. Secondly, imagination is an everyday thing you use it everyday in many ways. Imagination is like an opinion,no one can take that from you. It can be positive nor negative either way no one can change the way you think. Imagination is everything because you always imagine or wish you were doing something or wish you were with someone. As a person that has dreams to succeed you need imagination to achieve them. As one can see,me as a football player. I use my imagination a lot for many reasons. Because I am very competitive when it comes to sports, I always want to be better than the old me. I always want to be one step ahead from everyone. For that reason I think I use my imagination a lot. Like if I ever lose at something I would think about it and say ""imagine if I won"".

633,1415,0D0CADFF33DF,"Imagine being a doll that is being controlled and someone telling you that this is your character traits. You dont have control on your own character trait because you let others influence you to think thats what your character trait is. Many people let others pick what their character trait is instead of doing it on your own and learning who you are and who you want to be and/or let others decide what their character trait is or are obligated to be this this person their not. Most let others decide because they dont know who they want to be or what others want them to be. I agree with this prompt because you are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life, you let others choose because you arent sure who you want to be, and you choose what you want your character trait to be. You are obligated to because the other person is in control of your life and will make you feel vulnerable if you dont do as they say; they are the ones in power with what your character trait is and who you are going to be. An example can be your parents especially your mom that raises you. It might not be all mothers out there but most of them will raise a child and tell them what their character trait is going to be. Another example can be is if you are in a situation and its between your life or death and the person makes you choose what your character trait is when that is not who you want to be but your life is on the line. Whoever you choose to be reflects who and what you are going to be in the future. You let others choose what your character trait is because you are not sure what your character trait is and dont know who you want to be. Many people tell each other that this is who they are and just influences people to tell you thats who you are. How will you know that for sure though if you cannot even figure out what your character trait is on your own and if that is what you choose it to be. This is where you over think about your character trait and just take your friends or any other persons opinion about who you are and what your trait is. If you are not sure who and what your character trait is just learn more about yourself and dont take anyone elses opinion and make that your character trait. You choose what you want your character trait to be because you have the power to control who and what you want to be and not what others have to say what your character trait is. You yourself choose to make what your character will be. The best thing that a person can do to figure out who and what they want to be and what their trait is going to be is listing what you like about yourself by doing pros and cons. You will know your character trait when you feel comfortable and you love yourself for making another person smile and making their day. Along the way you will learn new things you did not know about yourself. We get to choose our own character traits not others, let that be a valuable lesson.

You have to be active and you have to always keep looking until you have the job you want. Nobody will come to you and tell you ""Do you want this job?"". You have to get it and if you are not doing anything to get it nobody will. In todays society people do not want to be active in what they want to get, they want everying to be givin to them. How can we give people something they did not work for they need to be active and search for what they want to get it. People may disagree with my statement and say ""You do not need to be active for things to be done or to get a job."". If you are not active then how do you know things will come your way. Everything you get in life is earned through being active and getting things done nothing comes at a snap of your fingers.",6,6,7,8,8,6,3777,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

To begin with student should not have cell phones during the school time because it could make a lot of noises . so if you have a cell phone right and your in class and its in high volume and you receive a call or a text message thats not right because teachers are trying to teach you and all your doing is making noise . Thats why i think we should not have cell phones during the school time . In addition i think we should not have cell phones in school hours because it could be distracting to the students or even the teachers , because last week there was a girl texting during class and the teacher saw her so he had to stop his lesson and take her phone away and rite her a referral . So thats distracting and a waist of time isnt it. Thats why i think they should not have cell phones during school hours because its distracting .

640,1422,8A7299DA28E5,"A British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Do we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control? I think we can control our character traits because we can choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think we choose our character traits. For example, I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Being quiet isnt a good or bad thing like you can be quiet sometimes not all the time because you got to talk once in a while. You have to balance it all out. I remember back when i was i middle school 6th to 7th grade I was a quiet kid with little friends like I would not talk to no one. I felt so alone because of that, then I started talking to people and got lots of friends. So, I think we can control our character traits. Thats why I think we choose our character traits like being quiet. Also, another example is being social. Being social is a great thing to have because talking to people is good like you can make friends, learn new things. and even discover new things. I was a very talkative kid in 7th to 8th grade I remember that I felt like I was annoying to some people because i talked a lot. I also learned new things like how to approach and talk to people. I discover new things to like I discover that people can change over time. Some are nice then they turn moody or mean, and others were mean then nice. Some people dont change and that happens to thats how the world works. Thats why I think we can control and choose our character traits like being social. Therefore, my next example is being a over yourself. like being confident or keeping yourself in check thats a good trait to have. It can be also a bad trait because you can be over confident and cocky. Some people dont like those kind of people because they say ""there no fun"" or they are ""party poopers."" Ill confess that I was a little cocky and over confident when it came to sports because i was a very competitive kid. Sometimes I even screamed and yelled of happiness because I scored or won a game. Some people also think thats our character traits are influence beyond our control, and yes I can see there point of view because, when I screamed and yelled when I scored or won I game i didnt control it i just yelled. I couldve not yelled I couldve just celebrated with my hands and look up in the sky but I didnt do that. This is why I think we can choose our character traits like being over yourself. Finally, I think when the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" He though one of two things he thought we choose our character traits, or our character forms by influences beyond our control. I think he thought we choose our character traits like being quiet, being social, and being over yourself. This is why I think he thought about we choose our character traits.",7,6,7,6,7,6,1838,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
641,1423,B3F18E671DF2,"Do you think it is good decision to make school longer? When i was in my home country schools was only for six hours i disagree that schools extend two hours a day because the students will lost their focus, teachers will get tired from standing more than two hours, and some of the student will change their high school. The student will lost their focus for example when i was in Afghanistan our school was from 8 to 12 and we where tired from listening to teachers. However, when i came to united state it was tough for many reason. for instance When i came to united state it was so hard for me to get up at six and come home at two o clock. In addition if we have school ten hours of school each day the student and the people who work inside the school they all will get tired of school and student will not learn the teachers will get tired of teaching ten hours a day. Teachers will get tired of sanding for example they teach more than two hundred student a day so they will get tired and they teach for tomorrow. Once students get tired they will lost the focus form the teachers and they will start to talking with each other playing around the classroom or they will using their cell phones taxing their friends planning to skip their classes or panning to drop out of schools. The student will not get everything in their mind they will forget it for the next day. Maybe some student come to school and stay at school longer than seven hours a day but maybe some student cant stay longer than seven hours a day because maybe they work after school or maybe doing some think at home for example maybe they take cares of their little brothers or sisters or maybe they clean up the house. Teachers will get so tired because they will talking all day long explaining the chapter and students will not listening to them. Some students will change their schools because they doesnt want to be at schools more than six or seven hours a day. And also those who works in the schools it will be hard for them to clean up the schools the bad rooms or to cook food for students and than after that they have to wash ever think for next students that are coming after A lunch.

However some people may think that your character can be influence by which you interact with (like parents), and your personality is based in others personality. You choose what you want it to be, no one can choose your own way, or in this case your character, is primordial that you choose your own traits, if you dont do that then youll be un-secure of your self and that can carry many problems to distinguish who you are, or where you should go in life. Have your own character is a big thing to have, because many people can imitated others character or personality from their parents or any famous person, but if you have you own character that means that you are unique. A recent study in the University of Virginia shows that people who choose their own character and their own way to act, or behave, they are happiest than the ones that imitated other people personality. You are your owner, your are only yours! Since you are a baby you start forming your character or personality, you have control of what you want to be or what you want it to do. But some people will argue that your parents are whom form your character and they chose your personality traits, but that is not true, your character is formed by your own experiences in life, as Jonh lubbock wrote ""Your character will be what your self yoose to make it.""

643,1425,7E530A20DA68,"People and students have some amazing talents and skills. Talents are very impressing and challenging for an example,people that can juggle with oranges or bottles and people that can sing. Some talents can be very difficult at first and people can give up easily but when people practice and they try they do not give up. The skills and talents I enjoy the most is playing the violin,cooking,and makeup on my own time. When people play the violin they say It is very difficult and it is very boring. Some adults that have played the violins and the chelos are very talented and their skills are by playing the violin Is just slowly moving the bow towards up and slowly moving it down. When I first played the violin It was not easy moving the bow fast towards the bridge of the violin and knowing the songs that some students had to play by their self. When I had my first Pyrimid Concert In Elementary school I had a great time playing and learning how to play the violin. Cooking is another talent that some people like to enjoy while they are home or they help their mom cook. Cooking can be fun and people can experience new kinds of food that they never tried. When I was little I always wanted to cook with my mom and she cooked all different kinds of food like Rice with Chicken,she made Pizza,and also baked Cookies and Inchiladas. They are resturants that have good flavor foods like when people go to the Buffet or to IHOP.When I cook with my mom or my sister I experience that cooking can be hard because people do not know what ingrediants they have to use or the taste is disgusting. Makeup Is one of the funest. They are some teenage girls that love to do their own makeup or they just do it for fun. A lot of teenage girls start learning how to do makeup by watching on the internet step by step. Teenage girls have really good talents in fashion and using good color shade on thier eye lid. Talents In makeup are fun when people have their own time with their firends when they come over. Some girls feel more comfortable by using makeup and some girls do not. Makeup can be enjoyable and fun to experience. They are some difficult talents and skills that people give up on. When people experience or find something they like they would like to try it. Cooking Is like a talent where people like to enjoy cooking like the cheifs they make really good food. Makeup is fun to do and it is really amazing when people are a makeup artist and really good at fashion.

644,1426,ADDFE045FED1,"Although, I believe sometimes being around many different influences, such as religions, trends, and different cultures. We all choose our own traits. Certainly, many different things can influence us. Such as trends, for a couple of weeks, months or years. Many different things could be could be trending. Like different genres of, movies, music, or video games, even clothing. In the moment when those things are popular it might feel amazing to own those particular things. Many people who cant afford things of such nature such as the latest cars, jewelry, and brands like Louis Vuitton, Gucci, Moncler, or anything of type nature that is trending. People like teens or young adults might feel terrible because their friends could be having those things and they cant afford it, and when they get some money they might go and spend it on expensive things to fit in. But as you get older, and the trend is over, most people regret spending a lot of money on things they didnt need. After the trends die out and everybody moves on to the next set of trends. People will start maturing and decide to wear, listen to, and do their own things, instead of being just like everybody else. Most people, if not everyone would prefer doing things they like rather than doing things they dont like because their friends want to do it. A majority of people in the world have made themselves who they wanted to be. Every persons interests can influence them more than any person or friend. If it wasnt for peoples interests, and wanting to be themselves whether they were accepted or not. Most famous people wouldnt be where they are today. A lot of people use their interests to get them out of bad situations, which brings me to my final paragraph. Following your dreams and being true to yourself can take you a long way. Although when people think of chasing their dreams, they picture being rich, famous, and living in a mansion. Others may think of starting a business with things they have a passion for and enjoy. Even having a daily basis of clients/ customers, even if its 5-10 people a day. At some point if that person stays consistent and humble, something big may happen for them and their business can just become huge, and they could keep on growing and having people who also share the same interests could come in on a regular basis.

645,1427,1C17939C40A7,"I really like this quote because, i believe this is a problem that basically happens in many homes and also many society of people. Being motivated to become what they dont want to be and what you dont have the passion for. Therefore i disagree with Emersons statement; Why? Becacause i believe everyone has a choice to choose what they are passionate about, not what the society or the influenece of their parent saying I see a doctor or an engineer in you. Having the love for a profession or a study is one of the greatest thing ,you feel like you are living everytime you figure something out,you feel happy and motivated to take it futher to you reach the top. When someone is passionate about a profession,studing of a language,writting,discovering,healing,helping people,anything in this world i believe they should be motivated. Not brought down by making them do something else because its not healthy physically or mentally i believe. An example is ME.I have studied business almost my whole like since i was in my country,beause i wanted to be work in any field of business. Last year i moved to the united state and my parent and everyone around me said i should be a nurse,but i dont have the passion for nursing,but with no support on my side i decided to be nurse,and mentally i feel like ita going to be difficult, and i always bring my slef down when i thing about it, but if it was something i had the passion for i wouldnt mind the hardness i will just concentrate on how i will make it and and believe in myself that i will surly get and will also be very determined. Thata what i mean by being motivated and supported to do what you want and do what you love is really great. So i disagree with this quote,some people will agree because they believe your society or your surrounding makes you who you are. But i believe the society and everyone around do not make you,or can not stop you or influene you to do the opposite of what you want to do unless you give them the chance like me or you take your stand and let them know why you want and love this thing and it will be a great honor if you accomplished it .

648,1430,876DD6D022A9,"Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. Succeeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words arent even similar. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. For example, anger doesnt let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. When trying to find a new job at any place but you dont know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. Because you wont have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. They wont choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job. However other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. For example, achieving something is no that easy. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. Studying its not just passing classes but its about learning things for the next day. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that its not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. But what if the SOL is failed twice wont that prejudice your next year. Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that its over. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. Thats happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. Lets pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because its over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and its there to fight until its achieve it. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. Learning a new job its so frustrate because at the beginning you wont have any idea on what you are doing. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you dont depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear. As previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away. My solution is to have confident in yourself. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day.

649,1431,0943E322C195,To me its more beneficial working as a group. I have a few reasons why its better working with a group rather then working alone you can learn from one another also be motivated to learn as a group. Making new friends can be tough but when you are but in a group you can make friends with each other. One thing in a group that can be good and bad is having disscustions with the group. There are many reasons why i prefer working with a group and im hear to share with you. Working with a group is all about sharing new ideas and discovery with your group that some people didnt know about. With a group everyone would get good grades and ace their exams. Some people in your group may have the same intrest as you and would like to study that objective more and being motivated by one another. In my opinion working with a group is more simpler and fun at the same time and kids will enojy learning that way. One small little problem about working with a group is having disscustions about the subject that the group is talking about. They with all disagreements but also argree with each other . The group tends to get mad maybe because someone in the group said something the other didnt like and would have a argument. There are more pros then cons in working with a group for sure . Everyone has a different saying if its beneficial to either work with a group or work alone . Im not at all saying working alone is a bad thing on the contrarie its also good because sometimes you might not get along with the group you got asand with and you just wanna do your work alone.

First , I think its important to have a positive attitude in your everyday life because, of the stress that goes on. No one will understand how you feel other than you. If you stay in the mindset of "" i cant do this,"" ""this is too hard."" You will never see yourself prosper and grow. How can you have the biggest expectations in life when you are so dull and negative. To advance you need to be aware that everything is going to be okay, be reminded of that. Secondly, your work place always has to stay positive. This is the place you go to work in , this is a place you try to distract yourself from the rest of the world. If you set your self to a person who feels as if they cant do anything then you will never reach that promotion youve been waiting for. If you set your self as the person who puts too much on themselves, you will never see growth. You can do the impossible it will just be up to you to change your circle. Although, there are many people who live in doubt and build this wall of negativity in there life. You cannot be that person. Think about the little things in life , you have a roof over your head, your family is safe, you are safe. You never go a day without eating. Those are the little things that matter.

When we are doing something for us, we can ask ourselves questions like the ones I stated.

We may have our moments where we can get tired of doing the most, but then we are able to tell ourselves how much the hard work is worth at the end when we do the most of what were supposed too. Once we do the best that we can, we can reflect on it later on in life and be so proud of ourselves and tell ourselves how tired we were for doing the most but how much worth it all was at the end. I have my moments where I can be so tired of trying my best and just want to give up. But then I take a step back, look at my work, and once Im done and I tell myself how proud I am because it got me far. We also are able to have no regrets at the end of the day and reflect on it and see how dedicated we were and still are to this day. We can tell others our story and say how proud you are for yourself and see how dedicated you were and still are for doing what you can and doing better. Not in any bragging type of way but to motivate them in a way. Youre able to pick up the habit of being so dedicated to bettering yourself or others by doing more once youre doing. Its like self motivation, telling yourself ""you can do more."" Once we pick up this good habit of accomplishing more than what we are supposed too, we motivate not just ourselves, but others as well to do more and more. Like I said, we can look at the bright side of it always, and feel nothing but good and proud of ourselves at the end. When we build this good habit and do the most, we are able to do the more than what we could before and little by little building that up. At the end of accomplishing what you could, you are able to tell others what the hard work and dedication gives you at the end of it all. As well as how far it gets you in life. It can sometimes motivate others to strive for the best and it can help them, sometimes they need to hear you out for it to motivate them. What I like about it is that, when we are able to pick up this good habit of ours, we can tell others about it and it can motivate them to do the same. Its like we talk them into to striving for the best for themselves and others in life. Its like we are passing this good habit weve built down and then it just keeps going and going. Sometimes hearing others out really helps others a lot. When you are able to just take a moment and take one step back, it really is possible for you to accomplish more than what you can when youre doing. You motivate not just yourself but others when you really are dedicated to doing your best and it can become a good habit. Youre able to pass that down and it can give you a positive mindset to it all. The outcome can turn out to be good and make you feel good about yourself at the end. It can get you so far in life as well and youre able to look back at the most that you have accomplished and have no regrets about any of it. It is truly motivational and can truly help if you are really dedicated to it all.",7,8,8,8,9,8,317,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
653,1435,DA6899CADE97,"The British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Although many people believes that Churchills statement is wrong, I believe in the important role that failure plays in peoples lives to be successful in the future. In fact of the society, failure is a bad experience, however, I believe that failure is a way to help people to grow in personally, to be more successfully, and teaches you how to be mannerly. Every single day, we are exposed to a reality that can be favorable or unfortunate. Where people need to learned about their failures, and grow personally from their new experiences. They made you more mature. That can be the example of my aunt, a nice woman who had an accident in the past. She was traumatized after that accident, but that never stop her to receive professional help with enthusiasm and do what she likes to do, helps others. My aunt understood that everything is possible if we do not loss our enthusiasm, and our pleasure to be success. Life treat of deal with all unexpected situations. Failures that people never thought that could happen to them. However, everything depends on your enthusiasm, if you want to stay in the same place or learned about your failure and keep going until you accomplish your dreams. Generic_Name, a friend, is an example of the statement just mentioned. Generic_Name wanted to pass his classes in order to graduate. Generic_Names teachers always told him that he was wasting his time if he was planning to go to the university, but Generic_Name never loss his hopes. Generic_Name became more expert in every subject, he graduated. Moreover, he demonstrated that everybody could be successful, if they try their best. Everything has two faces, like a coin. As failures can be bad experiences, they can also be helpful if we look at them with good eyes, and if we receive them with good manners. People need to realize that the way in which a thing is happening is not bad at all. Things happens to foment our self and made us more mature. An example of this can be all of us. When we are passing for a bad moment we need to control our behavior, take a rest and think in a positive way to be successful. In conclusion, Churchills statement is more than right. Do not pay to much attention to the different failures and keep going with enthusiasm, is the key to be successful in life. Accomplish a dream that we are fighting for, is the best that could happen to everybody. That is why we do not need to discourage and loss our enthusiasm just for a failure that happened to us.

654,1436,196096A1C048,"I would like to become a Cardiologist in my future, so that I can save peoples lives by charging them less money and nobody has to suffer like my uncle, it is one of the high-paying jobs and there are less heart surgeons in the world. My uncle was detected with a hole in his heart since he was born. But my family couldnt afford the money for the surgery, so they left him like that itself. He started feeling more pain when he studying his final years of high school. When he went through the surgery, he had exams going on. Despite the pain, he studied for his exam and passed in flying colors. Many people cannot afford the surgeries for not only heart but for many organs in their body. So, I wanted to change that and help all the people in the world, so that they can live happily at least once in their lifetime. It is one of the high-paying jobs in the world. My family was not able to treat my uncle because of not having enough money at that time, so I wanted to earn money and save lives at the same time as much as I could. In this way, every body in my family will not be able to endure all the pain they had even before I was born. I will do anything to keep my family happy. In this world, we have more doctors in other fields but not much in the cardio field. I wanted to change that because half of the worlds population has hidden heart defection, they dont know still, like my uncle. This is because of less cardiologists in the world. When people go to the heart surgeons, the doctors ask more money then the usual charge as there are only a few doctors in that field. People cannot afford the money they ask and just leave their defected hearts, they continue doing their day-to-day works. If this continues, then people will die without even enjoying their whole life in this world. I wil become a heart surgeon and charge my patients the money they can afford. With this I will also be happy and the people who come to me will also be happy as they get cured. In conclusion, becoming a cardiologist is one of big dreams I want to achieve in my life. I will save peoples lives only by costing them with affordable money. I wont let my fellow people go through what my uncle did, so I would do anything to save their lives. People are dying across the world because there are only a few doctors in that field and they also charge them high, so I will change these peoples lives by doing the opposite of what the other doctors did. I want to change this world into a better place to live because everything here is money, so i hope i can change it.

Enthusiasm is everything you need, when you want to strar something, without enthusiasm we can have a lot of failure if we dont try again and again, it is like the main function of your brain, your personality, and your attitude, to dont have any failure in your life, someone with a great enthusiasm is someone with many opportunities in his life, someone with a good control about what he wants and what he does, someone who doesnt give the opportunity to fail in what he is doing, failure will be always right there in from of you, but your are the only one who accept it or not.

It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Some people say that you can know someones character by just the first impression. First impression are possible to change because they might had a bad day, and you always have to know the character before in order to judge it. People all over the world are always going to have bad days, and thats normal because life consists on having good days and bad days; if youre having a bad day, of course you wont have a good attitude towards people. For example, some people can have problem at their house, work, school, etc... and obviously thats going to affect on their behavior and they might treat you good or bad, it depends on the situation. When you first see someone and they seems like a bad person, that doesnt mean he is a mean person; he can just be having a bad day or something bad happened. In order to judge someone you have to know the character first. In life you cant be walking judging people just because they did something or just by their looks. For example,The majority of the population in the whole world knows the saying "" Dont judge a book by its cover "" this meas that just by looking at person from his outside, doesnt mean they are going to be like that on the inside. People might look either a mean person or a good person, there is some people that look like they are a good person and that they have a nice behavior, but at the end of the story they might do you wrong and you are going to be the one losing by trusting the person by just thinking they had "" a good personality""; However, there is also the people that looks like a ""bad person"" but some of those people can be nice from the inside, and you might need help from them at one point. In conclusion, first impression are possible to change because people might be just having a bad day, and also because after you get to know the character as they originally are, then you are going to start thinking differently about that person. Its important for you to know the character first before you start judging that person, because you never know if that one person that you rejected/judge at the beginning, can be the person that you need the most in the future.

Impressions could change in many ways we as citizens, have so many expressions of how we should confront others. Some of the popularity of the United States dont like people because of their impressions, but some citizens hate it when they have the same impressions too. Even though people have problems of how their impressions work also they say that citizens may need help of how to control their: sadness,anger,happiness,and fear when they give impressions to others. Teachers in schools say they have problems with kids attitudes this year of how they approach others, and of how they approach their teachers too. We as citizens cant help of how we express, give impressions,and how to put our emotions out their even so you cant trust your parents,friends relatives for help nor the teachers the government cant help us or the president . People can change their impressions;in so many ways of thinking they can: ask for help, ask for advice,and talk with someone about it. Impressions can be held in different ways of being they can be held by trying to go for something at the store,eating ice cream, talking with someone close. Parents think that their kids or others wont change their impressions towards others even though they think that there can be a possibility that can happen you can try and approach your kids by sitting down with them,giving them time to help them,trying to understand them. Impression can change in many different ways,but its not impossible to make that change sometimes impressions can be helped by others some of the people in the U.S. have problems trying to say good impressions about how they feel,wanting to confront a person,but others just might dislike that person they might also have hate in them,but they might not. Into todays economy people are the same of their impressions,some citizens have the problem of dealing with those impressions,although they have the same emotions but also the same expressions.

So he decided to do some research on what kind of doctor he wanted to be before entering high school. Finally, Generic_Name decided he wanted to be, a surgeon. Took all of the classes he needed to be one. Few years later, became a surgeon, making lots of money, living in a nice house, and is living the best life he could dream of. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Personally I think they should identify a career by the time they enter high school. So they can have the opportunities on what they need to do to get the job and not to be stressed out too much. Those are the reasons why they should commit to a career by the time they get to high school. The first reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. In order to get the job, you need to go check out some places on what they do, so then you would know what to do. The other opportunity you have is you would know what classes you would need to take. For example, if you want to be a history teacher you basically just have to take most of the history classes, or if you want to be doctor you would basically take all sciene classes. The other opportunity is that if you want to make a lot of money have a plan set up. Thats the reason why you should identify a career by the time you enter high school to have opportunities on what you need to get the job. The second reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school is, so they dont get stressed out too much. If you know what you want to do then youre fine because the more you know the less stress youll be in. If you know what you want to do then youll be able to know what classes you will need to take, so then you wont have to take extra classes for no reason. Also if you need help dont hesitate to ask because everyone is here to help. The more you ask for help the less youll be stressed. Thats the reason why they should identify a career by the time they enter high school, so they dont get stressed out too much. Some people would disagree with me because they think its ok to wait to identify a career before they enter high school. They say that because they think high school is a place where you just hang out with friends, and not care about their grades when they should. Also, they think their interest in what they want to do will pop up eventually probably like in their senior year. No, that would be hard to figure out what college you would need to go to, dont even have a plan, and would just be stressed out. In conclusion, in society they think that they should have an idea on a career by the time they enter high school. I strongly agree with that and there are many reasons why. So they can have opportunities on what you need to get the job, and that is know what classes you would need to take. Also, so they dont get too stressed out for it. If you know what you want to do then youre fine because the more you know the less stress youll be in. Those are the reasons why i agree with this statement.

Since, no one is perfect everybody have something bad and something good this dont make a different the others. Although many people concern the failure how something the need due for doing a better person in the life but that does the means they cant due. Some people thinking what the failure is important for they life because they learning a new things and they put all of they for doing good person. Clarity, this people due everything for not failure something. Additionally, many people dont believe in the faillure they say is somenthing happed in the life for doing a better person. If they fail a class or dont pass the class they keep trying and never give up. Surely, with failers they learn from the expirence they will not loss the enthusiasm. Ask you can see failure is not always a good way to major sucess. One need to success failure is put a attention and due a better person and trying hard. If this people trying the things wiil be better in they were doing. Although all many people are success with failure.

664,1446,8E99E989024A,"We should have after school homework club because, some students need help with their classwork, some students dont pay attention and they could use after school to understand the topic and what they have to do, and they could improve their grade for classwork and homework. For example when I was in Elementary school, I use to stay after school for homework club because I couldnt understand anything so I stayed after and got help from my teacher. To begin with the homework club is good because for some students that need help could stay after with her/his teacher and do what they have to do with their teacher. Also they could get help by finishing their homework and classwork. Some students go home and ask their parents for help but some parents doesnt remember the question or dont know how to do it. So its helpful for students to have homework club and get help from their teacher. My other reason is that some students doesnt understand the question and its hard for somebody that doesnt understand their language. For example when I came here three years ago I didnt know any English neither my parents so i had to stay after, and get help from my teacher to understand what is the question asking me to do. Another example would be when students dont pay attention in class or fall a sleep its good for them to stay after school and get help from their teacher to understand. Finally students could get improve by staying after and learn better. Some students have bad grade for homework or their classwork, so they could stay after to get improved. Also students can improve their understanding. For example my cousin use to have bad grade for homework, so he stayed after school, and got help from his teacher, and learn better, and got improved. Lastly all of this reasons and details are why school should have after school homework club. Students need help with their homework and to get improve.

666,1448,6642E181B08D,"I think that summer is to enjoy the weather, family, friends and if you have a pet also him and everything else. no body would like to be thinking about school work or trying to figure it out to complete homework. In my opinion students need to relax from a big long year of school and this is not just convinient for for young people, we also know that we have a clear example of Adult people( older people) they also need a big break from their jobs because they might feel really tired or stressed with work same as students and so that i am not trying to compare adults with young people I know they have even more responsabilities with their lifes but students comes to be more understanble because of the reason that they need to save more energy and have enough sleeping time but adults also need the same things and due that many jobs required just a week of vacation (sometimes even more) they feel really streess and tired and that why they would really wish to have a big vacation to can spend time with their family etc. same with student now that they have the opportunity to have a big vacation enjoy it. Plus many students really love summer because the weather( the warm breeze) the feeling of summer or the feeling that you know like freedoom not worry about your grades, activities, projects and etc. makes a lot of diference between a long break and a shorter brake, but I also take the position of the educator, I know they wouldnt like to been repeating things to make student remenber of the subjects they saw the last year and having issues with things they forgot, That would be really stressful but come on! Who wouldnt like a big vacation? good for some teachers that save money to enjoy summer. I also take the student position and as student I identified my self with the first character I describe when Students need the vacation to relax, but theres another big example of why vacation should be longer. first of all some student plan their goals during the summer probably to get a full time job during summer ( i KNOW EVEN SOME TEACHERS do ) to can save money and spend it on things they need another example is to save money for collegue, yes for collegue. and probably this is the major goal of many students trying to have a great summer because of the only reasong that they dont have as much support as the other students but at the same time I understand teacher or educators because their goal is to push us up in our goals and the once a year a 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week of in spring and fall sounds really nice since some student may love the weather by those times even though they like to see the fall so theres not problem concluding with everything else it will be almost the same as the regular summe vacation except that It will be more shorter. In conclusion, the break that we already have is perfect because of the only reason of that many student love it, the weather is so chill the beaches are already open and is enough time to go out of town to see your family and have a great time with them and good for those who liked to work during summer just to have some extra money or help a little of bet their spences.",6,5,6,6,4,4,1334,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
667,1449,F4E879AE7FBA,"The greater danger for most of us is setting our aims too high and falling short because many people try to aim for something thats imposible for them to accomplish, falling short on your goal will make you want to give up, and not having the motivation and energy will get you no where. Most of us should set a realistic goal for them to aim; but sometime we aim too high and set an impossible goal that we cant accoplish it. For example: some people aim to be perfect; but thats imposible because no one is perfect. Some people will do so much work for no reason because if they dont have the materials or a plan for that impossible goal th,en theyre wasting their time. The danger of this is that no one will accomplish a single goal if theyre aiming to high. Many people try to get the results that they want; but many fall short. Falling short on a goal can be a big danger, because it could lead many people to calling themselfs a failure. This can also make people want to give up on what they were aiming for. Everyone wants to be successful in life and not a failure, because if youre a failure, then youll face many challenges and suffer. Many successful people in the world accomplish their goals because they have the motivation and energy on doing better; but many people dont have a motivation or energy that they get no where in life. Motivation and having energy are some keys that can help people aim for something big and be albe to accoplish their goals. Another way people can aim big or be successful with their goals is if they have a positive mind set. The great artist Michelangele once said, ""The greater danger for most of us lies in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" Setting your aims low and achieving your marks is not the great danger or a danger. However, setting your aim too high and falling short is a great danger because you can learn from it.

668,1450,34AC1808D15A,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school student to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. student who follow this plan must take courses during the summer or in the evening. Is it a good idea for student to finish high school early? I believe that is not a good idea for a student to finish high school in three year. The reason for this is because they might have a change of heart in what they want to be. Also having four year of high school gives them time to see if they really made a good choices on their career. Also ""will they go along with take courses during the summer?"" when it time to have fun,relax and enjoy the hot nice weather with family and friends. These are one of the reason that its not good idea. Another way to look at this is to find out if there going to stick with the career they pick. For example, when pick a job everyone look for better pay and benefits to see if the best fit for them . For a student it is totally different because they are look for better pay instead of look for a fitting job they will like an enjoy and stay at . Instead they look at a job that didnt suit them, then just quit looking and jumping from job to job. Therefore i find it best if student take there time and complete all four year of high school so that they see what they like to do and complete all their goals and achievements. Another subject is that entering college and the work force one year early is stressful with a lot of responsibility. There no time to be acting out. Taking your time in high school isnt so bad there not as much stress, as in going off to college because of the expenses there will be. entering college one year early is stressful there many reason. one of these reason is there no time to slack off its all about studying and getting everything done. where in high school you time to turn thing in later if there not fully completed. As you see there a big different in the two, think about the choices before making a quick one. In conclusion having four years of high school let them have time to figure out what they want to after they leave to see what they become. There no rush there time, to see what they want to be and what their going to do. There many goals that can be achieve also thing to get better on. Once you leave high school it time to response able for these reason i think it best to do all four year because there no rush on see who you want to be.

669,1451,35954693FE8E,"High school, the most perfect time to plan for the future. In some societies, students are required to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The high school will select courses for students to guide them toward the career they are considering. Some people say that it is not a good idea to identify career at high school because students are not ready for entering the adult world. While other people say that it is a good idea because it helps students to plan for their future. To me, I believe that knowing what am I going to do is important. Once people have their goals, they can plan and prepare for their futures. How can people plan for their futures? By thinking about the careers they want to enter, they might also think about what are the things they like to do. They could choose the careers that are the most interesting to them and the perfect colleges base upon their interests. Also, people can have more time to work on their dream such as search more information, meet basic requirements, and get advises from their counselor. Therefore, when people are ready to go to the college, they wont be confusing about what to do. Because they have their goals with them. What about prepare for the future? Well, some schools will provide courses that will fit to students the most. If the students identified their careers, they could do better at studying the related objects in college than those who havent think about that thing at all. Because the students know what they want to be, they can choose to take related courses to learn the knowledge they might use in college courses for their career. Some people can even save thousands of money just by taking AP courses which will give them the credits that college will accept. Some may argue that it is too early for students to think about their future by the time they enter high school. They have plenty of times to do that during their senior year. However, if students dont know what are they going to do after high school, they will have no idea about which college is the best for them and what career they want to have. By considering and taking the courses in high school, people could get to know the career and decide whether or not they want this career. It is better to change your mind in high school than in college. Because by that time, people will waste their money and time to change their majors. Anyway, identifying your career when you are entering high school is a really good idea. You can choose the courses that are perfect for you and your career and also be ready for college since you have your goal already. Therefore, high school is a perfect time to think about the future. It is the entry to the adult world.

670,1452,E7EFD51B632F,"The most persuasive, efficient way to influence others takes someone to set a good example of their behavior. Those examples sets an image in peoples minds of how they want to see themselves in an ideal state. Moreover, every single human being on this Earth has a certain vibe or energy they give off due to their actions and thinking that people perceive or take in to judge that person. When people see that someone else has an energy or vibe he/she likes or agrees with, he/she will tend to gravitate towards it. Setting a good example is the best way to influence others because people want to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives. The first reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to know what is morally right or wrong. Martin Luther King Jr. is demonstrated as a great example of influencing others about what is right and wrong by leading a protest that many African Americans were involved in. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a famous speech called "" I Have A Dream "" which radiated strong energy that gave African Americans the strength and pride to protest the whites racist segregation laws. The great example set by Martin Luther King Jr. displayed that he was a capable and high-thinking individual that African Americans gravitated towards. Due to the fact that African Americans were influenced by Martin Luther King Jr., they were able to understand what their rights as a human being were and how wrong the whites segregation laws was. The second reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people want to see change and improvement within themselves. A personal trainer could be a figure for some people as they are persistent and passionate at what they do. This can lead people to being motivated at the gym and encouraged to become more fit and healthy. Also, It sets a postitive message in their mind saying they have what it takes to get to the point of where their personal trainer is. Having the personal trainer as a figure to gain motivation from led to a person seeing improvement and change in their body and mindset. The final reason why setting a good example is the best way to influence others is people desire to take on similar motives. At an early stage of development as a child, they tend to look up to their parents or popular figures in awe as they gain inspiration to become a certain profession. A child may have seen an astronaut on television and became inspired to become one when he/she grows up. This inspiration may have led this upcoming astronaut to take astronomy and other space-related classes. Then an amateur astronaut is born because the astronaut on TV decades ago set a good example on how interesting tasks an astronaut has to do which led to the inspiration. In conclusion, people better themselves due to influence. Influencing others to know what is morally right or wrong, to see change and improvement, and to take on similar motives are all based on good examples that are set. The examples set must give off something that interests the other person to be able to connect with the person. Also, that person must retain an energy and vibe that coinsides with the other person for that person to be influenced. This is indeed the best way on influencing individuals.",10,8,10,8,8,9,3354,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 10"

675,1457,F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldnt offer differing alternatives,because technology wasnt as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,theyll be able to benefit because they wont feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wontt have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they wont have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,theres a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because hes always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldnt have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people dont tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,its an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, whove unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasnt for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldnt have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldnt really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we couldve ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning.

677,1459,51CE1DCC5307,"Some people might have heard this before, ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" This is what the great artist Michelangelo said. People might not agree with this, yet setting aims higher is better. This is because by setting our aim high, people will be able to achieve bigger goals. Setting aims high might conceive more unique thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aims too low. There can be significant possibilities towards many directions too. Firstly, by setting your aim high, there can be significant possibilities towards many directions. Many people set their aims before they do or think about something. For example, which do you think will have more possibilities for job. Just applying for cleaning dishes because thats easy, or applying for every work field you can work for. This is the same for schools. For an other example, a student that does not know what he wants to do for his future choosing to go to the military, or going to collage with many opportunities. Going to the collage can increase the job opportunities and he might find a better job than going to military. Furthermore, setting our aim high will help people to conceive more unique or their real thoughts than people with rivet thoughts that set their aim too low. For example, people that aim low are most likely conceal or are not aware of their thoughts. This is because people that aim low will not try to achieve something too hard for them. On the other hand, people that aim high will try to achieve more harder tasks, and think about more things. This will help the human brains to develop and can help people to think in a unique way than other people. Famous artists that have created significant art works could have not created anything great if they have set a limit for their self. They all did not make any limit for their self and their abilities to create great works. All the unique ideas and arts exist because the famous artists aimed high. In addition, by setting our aim high we can achieve bigger goals than setting a lower aim for a higher possibility. For example, Just working for the minimum requirement for an assignment than working for the maximum of that assignment, which will give you a better grade? The answer will most likely be working for the maximum of the assignment. If you have your aim low you might give up before you achieve a task even if that was an important task. If your aim is high you wont give up and achieve the task. Therefore, having your aim higher is better than just trying to do the easiest thing you can. Some people might say that by setting the aim too high that can make them suffer. This can be true, but that does not mean you should aim too low. what is important is to keep everything balanced to the best. Everyone has been said to eat a balanced meal when they were a small child. This is the same for everything. Understanding your own abilities and setting the aim to what you can possibly achieve rather than setting the goal for something easy. Some might say that if people dont aim high they wont have to work hard, so they will have less stress. They might have less stress but not every stress is bad for people. Stress can even help people sometimes. For example, I was a student in Japan that hated school and was too lazy to do any work. I had a lot of stress and that made me stay at home all the time. Staying at home did not relieve my stress at all, and I did not feel good about my self. Therefore, I chose to go to school again. Stress will mostly affect bad for you, but there are good affects too. Finally, The hole point about this is that running away and choosing the easy way is not the best decision. Aiming low might look like its the simple and easy way thats safer but whats really the danger is for people to forget to aim high and believe they can achieve great things.

678,1460,AF71C89CD199,I think this pogram should be in every school beacuse this could help the younger students to learn more about the school. And the older students can the younger students and they can show them which room they have to go. And its better this way beacuse the older students knows more things about the school then the younger students do. And this could help the younger students learn more about the school. This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students. And the younger students gonna learn from the older students and this pogram can help the younger students get their grades up beacuse older students can help them do they work and get their grades up,5,6,6,6,5,7,2360,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
679,1461,ABBA50242CFA,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. That might a good idea for some students but not all. Today, many High Schoolers from the age of 15 to 18 have jobs. They work part time to help their parents pay for their phone bills, cars or something else. Sometimes they might want to work more, but school is 5 days a week, they have to do homework every night even on weekends. Going to work after school is very overwhelming. They get out at 9 or 10 depends on where they work, go home and do their homework, then go to bed probably late, and have to get up early the next morning. That goes on days after days. Many students can get stressed out easily. So I think attending classes online or video conferencing help lots of students who have jobs. Staying at home and study is still better than waking up and getting ready early in the morning to go to school. That might not be a big problem in summer or spring. But winter is the worst time of the year for students. The sun rises later than usually and sets earlier. It gets really cold and there is frozen ice on streets. Nobody wants to get up early and go to school or work when the sun hasnt even risen and frezzing weather outside. Of course they want to wrap around in their blankets and sleep in. But in the other hand, attending to school directly is better for some students. Leaning and teaching face to face is always easier than online. You could ask the teachers directly if you dont understand, and I think the teachers would be teaching and explaining in a better way face to face. Plus, you can meet new friends, socialize and participate in sports or any activities at school. So in the bottom line. I think its better to combine both ways. The students can attend school everyday, except for snow days. They can take classes online since they cant make it to school. Cut the students some slack on some Fridays. They can stay home and attend classes online. Or only apply on seniors. Because its their last year and they have lots of work to do. But in my opinion. Attending clases online or directly at school dont matter. What matters is that the students find their best ways to learn and relieve stress.

They argue that they are not focus and they are not learning. One should always accomplish a goal if one puts their mind to it. they gain new knowledge,skills, and information. If one has the knowledge he can accomplish anything. I wanted to learn how to make a dog house. I had no knowledge on how to build a dog house. My friend had told me that the school was having a science fair and that they were giving knowledge on how to build a dog house. I went and I had got the knowledge that i needed. I had the knowledge to stat it and to finish it. The dog house came out looking pretty good with the help of knowledge that I had. If one has the knowledge,skills, and information he can accomplish anything. If one has the skills to accomplish a goal he can can do anything. When i was in school I wanted to improve my skills in English. I would ask mt teacher to give me tips on what I needed to improve. She would tell me me not to use the word you. By the end of the year I was not using the word you. She had told me that my English skills were improving because I had been working on it all year. She told me that i was a strong writer. If one has the knowledge, skills , and information he can accomplish anything. If one has information he can accomplish any goal in his way.

681,1463,F032D40816C0,"Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm I think is a good idea because, you can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. You can be a successful person, because you can do all the things that you have in mind, and you can realize more than you already have, for example once my friend Generic_Name told me that her cousin Generic_Name he loves fix computers, but he only can fix computers he can not fix telephones, TV, refrigerators and another electronics devices and he always was sad because his goal was that he can fix all the electronic devices, he join in a group of people that fix electronic devices, he always cry because he did not understand the things that he was learn, he always was try day to day, so one day he was the winner in the competition of who was the person that fixed one TV in the less time as possible, he fixed the TV in 1 minute, other people fixed in 10 or 5 minutes, finally he earn a diploma of the best fixed person, after 5 years he learn that nothing was impossible for him , in the actuality he has a store that he sell and fix electronic devices. The experience of Generic_Name is a good example in our life because he learn that never give up, he always fight for his goals and that example we can do exactly the same that Generic_Name always fight for our goals and always try another new things that we think that we can not do. Also the reason that you need believe in yourself is that you always need be positive person, every day see what are the things that you need for have success or what you need to do every day. In my experience I was in 10th grade was my first day of school at Generic_School,I never was with a lot of nervous, and I did not speak English ,so all my classes in my first day of school I feel many eyes on my because I was the new student, then at the end of my day I take my correct bus and when I was at home talking with my mom I told her that I do not like the school because was different of my schools on my country and my mom told me that with the pass of the days I will feeling a good person, a correct person. So in my first year in the school I get all my classes with A at the end of my first year I earn one diploma in Math and four diplomas for each end of the quarter, so I pass 11th grade with excellent grades too, but sometimes I fail my classes my test in Algebra I fail many of the test or sometimes I get D or F in my classes and when I fail something is when I was think that I am not good in my classes or in English that was to hard learn the language English, all my teachers talk with me that I was a good student always complete my work, every day I was pay attention to my teachers, and then I pass to 12th grade this year is more difficult because I need pass all my classes, all my ESOL and other things for example my WISE test, and now my teachers, my counselor, my mom told me that I am a excellent person, and sometimes I think leave the school and start to work because I feel that I cannot go to the end of High School . This is my experience and I believe that sometimes I am wrong because loss enthusiasm it is not a good idea always I will have failure or another experiences that are not good. And this is why we need believe in our self if you do not believe in your self you may be you do not complete all your goals or all that you have in mind. Other people say that success consists of going from failure to failure and loss enthusiasm, but otherwise you need support of your family because the family is very important in your life and always you need a opinion from your family. For example one day my uncle Generic_Name he was in his college George Mason his family was in Mexico he was the only person that was in Generic_City. He always try to do all of the way correct and always be a good student and a good person, but one day he fail a very important test in the college that test was the final test in his College, and if he fail this test he can not graduate from College and he was feel like a person that he can not do anything and he told to his friend Generic_Name that he did not pass the final test, but Generic_Name said to Generic_Name that he can not tell to Generic_Names family because they may be feel sad for Generic_Name, so the option for Generic_Name was that he was need start one more time all the College or he can paid extra money for retake the final test, but was a lot of money, so he decided that he was taking one more time all the College, but he do not see for support of his family, finally Generic_Name told to Generic_Names family what happens with Generic_Name and why he still do not graduate from College, and Generic_Names family talk with Generic_Name and he tells the true and his family tell him that why he do not see for support in his family. This example is exactly the explain for why the support of your family is very important, the family is the first group of people that we need to tells them always the true and they will have a excellent opinion about what you asking them. In conclusion, loss enthusiasm when you are failure it is not a good idea because can be a successful person, you need believe in yourself, and you need support of your family. And always think about what are the things that you are complete or for what you need this goals. Also, think about that if you failure you need keep going and never give up because if you feel that you can not do anything all your life may be your will think that you not are a good person in something that you have in mind. Finally think about all the good things have a successful person and how you can do like a successful person what you need to do or what materials you need for be a successful person.

686,1468,037C88B5B111,"Most of the schools in around the world that cut off hours in school, and they get a good results. Some people say that is the good idea, but some people think that a bad idea depend on their opinion. If they extending the school day two hours, to a four- day school a week, they will give students get more chances to focus what they like, time to explore and spend more time for family. Some of the countries try to improve it and they received a lot of good responds from students and parents recently. New things always have a difference opinion, and so many people could not adapt it, but one day it will bring a revolution to education. The first thing brought the benefit for this idea is students can able to focus what they like. In the real world, Students have so much things to do. They have to start school at 7am to 2pm, it takes a long period of day and they could not practice what they like. If they can get less hours a day in school so they could practice sports, music,sciences instead of math and English. There must have some students interesting at classes in school and they enjoy it, but they are still force to take classes that they do not like, its not their advantages. Some students would quit school because they could not find out themselves in there, and it will costs a lot of problems into the future especially effects to the next generation. That why schools should give students more hour to get what they like to do. The problem related to previous the first thing is time for family. Still, students spent all day long in school, and some of them want to do their favorite things after school, then they accidentally forget spend time with their family. Family is the root behind success of student, but when they get home, they have to do their homework at midnight. So many tradition families that have a rule that student have to follow then they do not have time to do their homework. Some of students have a jobs after school to get more benefits, scholarships, to prepare their life in college. Some students just want to support their family and do not have time to think about school. they have to bring their homework everywhere they go. If schools follow a four-day school week, it would be better to students and their family; they can get more time to hangout; they do not need worry about school or test tomorrow. Students can enjoy their time with family. The important thing that can not miss is time to explore. A fish can not claim like a monkey, some people good at math, some at music or art and we can not take a person good at math to do music. That is exactly going on in school life; students can not find out what they truly want to do; they do not have creative. If school follow a four-day school week, students can receive more extra times to explore the world and life. They could discover nature that teachers can help them, reality could help students get more experiences and discover themselves what they good at. Europe countries like Holland and Ireland had tried this and they got the highest education in the world. In Europe, they do not have homework, students go to school four or five days a week but less hours. that is good thing that every schools in the world should follow. Eventually, schools and teachers just want do the best for young generation, and they want to make a better life. Sometimes, they should flexible time and give students a chance to focus what they like, family and to explore a life. Students still able to finish their work, only 24 hours a day is not enough for them to complete everything. School, themselves and family, that is a lot of things to do in a day. Life is hard, do not make it harder, that is a good quote to say. Schools should give students more time.

687,1469,918C1880FCD8,"When did you decide to research your future job? Students should start thinking of a certain career they would want to encounter by the time they reach high school. by the time students reach high school they must have a job theyre interested in. If students start viewing the concepts they need, they can become what they want to be. Also by starting early with a goal, researching, and acknowledging goals they can find a job that they would like. Also will have a distinct idea on how to succeed. First step, In most societies students start researching different jobs at a young age, so they know what they want to become in the future. Research helps students find what they need as a teenager, for example: getting a Standard or Advanced diploma, going to College, and getting a degree. when students start encountering what they need to accomplish they will tend to work hard and start receiving the information they desire. Also research gives a better understanding for the student to know what to find. Although some may say ""Information online may be false"" but there are multiple sites you can examine to observe the true facts. Second reason, Goals help students with finding a career to start. Goals help by giving an idea to a student of what the second step is, to find the best career for them. Goals can be both limited and unlimited. Although some may say ""Students should start thinking after they graduate high school because theres many jobs in life students might pick the wrong job"", but starting young helps the teens mind to find different careers. Also students can decide what they would want to commit to. Third reason, Acknowledging your goal will take a very important role of students lifes. If students complete their goals, and research they can acknowledge their goal. Examine the work they have finished and look through to check if they are missing anything. After students have finished their steps students may continue on finding a job that they want from the data they collected. Finally acknowledging goals will help in examining job duties. In conclusion students should start finding a job early. Starting young will help each individual student with, finding a job, how to determine if the job is right for you, and following along with accomplishing every goal. Students will have a less stressful time finding the right job. These 3 steps will help students find the right job: Goal, Researching, and Acknowledging their goals. Also its a good idea for young students to have at least a couple ideas of what they want to do as a career after high school.

689,1471,63314DE11287,"The main piece to improve your skills is during the process of keep learning. Most of the people got to the point where they become successful, thinking that they have the sufficient knowledge to stay where they are and not move forward. The most common mistake that someone can make is believe that they have learn enough to the point where is nothing else to learn. I strongly agree with the words that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, people that have got the title of professional and keep being successful in their daily are the ones that are still adding productive information to their life and career. The actual key that makes people become professionals everyday and give them the recognition of master is through the process of keep learning new things. Convince yourself that yo are not good enough ""Yet"" this to motivate you to believe that you need to learn more. Examples that we can see everyday, teen mothers when a young girl or even in some cases girls that are still considering a kid have to been each to be a mother. Teen mothers learn through the pregnancy to; take care of the baby, change diapers, give appropriate food and how give them bath. The process of being a mother for the first time, does not end when you give birth to the baby. There is not a book where it details you how to take care of your child, even if there is one it would probably not be as helpful as you learning each day. If there were a class of ""How to be a mother for the first time if you are a teen"" it would not cover all the expectations that you baby requires because you will be the only one that knows your baby, its behavior and what its needs are. Even adult mothers have said that they keep learning how to be mother everyday. Do not push back yourself because of the fact that you seen to be far away from your objective. If you have been studying for years, since first grade and still have to go to an University, it could make you think if it would be necessary those extra years. The answer is yes, even if you have been in school for about 10 years and still have to go to college to get you the information that you need to be able to get a decent job, yes it is necessary. The years where you have been taking classes that does not look that t would help you in the future in any way. They do have a purpose, and it is to inform you and help you to develop skills that have not been discover, whether you like math, history, science or languages. Any subject that you have learn is to help you find what you really like and how you can used for the future. That is why there are those extra years for college, to start to focus on your objective and teach you what you actually need to become successful. After you have got the extra years, does not mean your learning have also stop, when you get to practice for the career you have selected you keep developing your skills and growing as a person, and this because of the motivation of keep going beyond of what you already manage. Going beyond your expectations as a person would bring you benefit to your life. If you get a job based on your skills, experiences or knowledge it would also require the same process of keep learning. If you got the job where you always wanted and they approved you to work there because you qualify and you have study the career for years does not specific mean you know everything and you would directly get to the work and lead yourself to become another worker. Like always and how the Author Ralph Emerson emphasizes you would have to keep trying new material. You have experienced the process to gather the sufficient information to get this job, but now you are being told to go beyond and now you need to learn the system of the factory, office, building, hospital or any apartment you have being positioned. In this case does not mandatory need to keep educating yourself, but to improve in your work and become an efficient person you need to keep learning new skill that would apply to your job. Like is being remarked again the importance of keep learning to do new things so you can grow. The importance of always going forward and learn to manage new things will make you grow as a person in your life and improve the labor work. If you do not try nothing new and do not applied on your daily, do no expect to become successful as a person. You are the only one that knows how to lead yourself and what weakness and strengths you have, as a captain of your life you know where your boat should go, the wind could make you take different directions which is why you have to recognize where exactly your destination is. The fact the it seems that you have got far enough where you might feel afraid to go beyond, which could ruin what you already have does not mean it will. People argue that they are scared to keep going forward and decide to just stay stand where they are because is been far enough. You should not let yourself be the obstacle to keep learning new things to do. If you feel like that was enough and you got to were you stay, it is because you can go more fatter with the experience that you have. Do not stay in one point and make sure to keep walking and doing new stuff to help you grow, do something new everyday and prove yourself that you have become a successful person every time you go a step ahead. Keep growing to encourage yourself and others to keep doing something new and always going in different direction without stopping.",5,6,8,7,6,6,1297,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

691,1473,095E153640F7,"Creativity comes with great mind! Summer projects can be fun, if only they were chosen by students. If the students were to pick their own projects depending on the subject; they would be interested, more likely to do it, and enjoy as well. teachers spent a whole summer or a school year coming up with a topic for the students to do during the summer. And, it turns out that the students arent giving it much though or effort towards their given assignment. That can be waste of the teachers time and energy, but if the students were to come up with a topic and idea of their own they would do the project. if students were to choose their project, they would more likely to do it because its on something they want to learn and their curious. when students are curious they tend to explore their curiosity and be more drawn in the subject and want learn more about it. students can come up with great ideas when comes to doing their own projects. choosing a topic of your interest in a projects can explore students mind, and do the things they would never though of doing. The summer project can improve your grades in the class. for example a student that struggles a lot in class either because the they cannot keep with pace in class, with summer projects they can work on their own pace. and if students are not great at working in environment full students this gives the a chance to do in depended study. summer project can give an opportunity for students to increase their greats. if students were to chose their own assignment they could at pace that worked for them, and they wouldnt have to worried about due time date. students would have the whole summer to finish the project, and if they did not finish it, when they an entire summer to do it, now thats just being lazy and it can effect their grade. Subject can have a great impact on the student. If student is given an assignment on a certain subject their is a chance they would start procrastinate or not do it at all. therefore they would have zero interesting on doing the summer assignment. for example if i had a history project and a science project. And if my science teacher were to give me a project to do a research paper on how gene mutate, as interesting that sounds i would not do it because science does not fascinate me as history. Being able to choose a project of your own can be fun that way, it gives a student to look forward to do their work and be more fascinated it. Students should design their summer project; because thats less work on the teacher, it gives them an opportunity to just think outside their box, and they can make their teachers proud for doing their work, so they can look forward a better school year.

As we know, technology has became one of the most important things in our lives, and people now are abusing the use of technology and forgetting to contact with the others around them. Although it has both positive and negative affects on people, but we cannot declaim that our lives have been easier and better since we have had techonlogy. First, technology are used everyday by people at all ages because of its functions. We can complete many things online by using technology such as study, entertain, shopping, etc. For example, students use technology to serve for their learning like stuyding online or researching important things for their lessons. Lots of people also use it to play game, chat with their friends, or shopping online to relax after a hard-working day. With technology, we can find and do almost things we need so we can save our times and will have more times to do the other activities like spending time with family, or hanging out with friends. Second, technology helps us adpot hot problems, new informations of society faster and easier. We can read news on the websites, or watch the agenda to update more things everyday so we can have better knowlegde about things around us. Besides, many poor people have been helped by the others because the news about them have been shared wide-spread. This showed the major of technology and the care of people give to the others. Many people said the use of technology has the limitation of human contact, and its not all right. We can easily contact to the others by texting, calling as technology is developing . Using technology in general and social media in particular also can help us make friends. People often use Facebook, Instagram, or Snapchat to add friends over the world and follow them. It is a best way to know our friends, family members activities without asking because we dont have too much time to speak with them everyday. Otherwises, we still have to speak face to face to the others as much as possible so we can understand them better, and it also shows our care to them. Not only technology, everything in the world also has both positive and negative sides, and the main idea is ourselves. If we use technology for the right purposes, and can limit the time of using it, technology will be very useful to our lives. In short, technology can limit human contact or not based on us so lets try using it as limited as we can and dont forget to use it right ways, right times, and right purposes.",8,7,7,8,6,7,3654,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
693,1475,46977B27324C,"We all may have failure in life. In fact, we live in a world where everyone decides whether to be success or not to be success. In these days people are giving up on things that they might can do it, but they do not believe in themselves, going from failure to failure it does not mean to give up without trying. To be success, you must have to think positive and try it as many times as possible or as needed. The pursuit of success is a key to be someone in life. However, each individual has their own thoughts or opinions. Unfortunately people loss their enthusiasm that takes them to never be successful. For example, many people play sports; they do not always win. They have failures. Sometimes they win, sometime they loose. Having those failures makes them to keep practicing, learn from the mistakes they made and try to fix them. It is a important role that later on in other games will help them to win. Deciding to give up will help them to be successful in many things in the future. I had have many failures in my life. One of them is when I started to play the piano. I was twelve years old when I started. There was a time when I felt to give up because it was hard to play it, but I never loss my enthusiasm, I kept practicing untill I learned it. Having this failure make me think that if I never try, then I will never be able to success in life and neither to accomplish things in my own. Another thing, people had told me that I would not be a successful person because I have a son, who is only five months, my answer has been that I know it will be difficult to success, but not matters I will never give up untill I have achive my goals. Believing in myself is a thing that have help me to success. In conclusion, success is a word that everyone should think with positive. Having a positive attitude will also help to be success. We all should take advantage of those thing that are worth it, instead of being success in things that might not be value in life. Having success in life will matter in your future life.

694,1476,EF5922BDE9E5,"Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups. Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. Its a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when its due. When my teacher assigns group its way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. Its also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A. Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. Sometimes teachers doesnt know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. Seeking help from a classmate thats in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier. In conclusion , working with groups its more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done.

696,1478,B7AABB24BDB8,"Yes,we accomplish more if we are always doing something rather that doing inactivity. If we keep on doing something to accomplish it then victory is always near to us. Our continious work to accomplish any task will be paid later by our better results. Hard work and dedication always lead us towards the success so does if we are always doing something to accomplish the task. Doesnt it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. There is a famous saying that ""Rome was not built in a day"". Here the people were always working for many years to built Rome into a beautiful city. We can see their hard work and dedication really worth it as it is one of the most beautiful city among the world. Would it have been possible if they were doing inactivity? Obvioulsy no nah? Doesnt it sound foolish that inactivity also serve the purpose. It somehow can can help to accomplish taking much time but not the same way like if we are always doing somethng. As ""Where there is will there is the way"" in the same way if we really want something then we can achieve it if we keep on working and always do something for that. I can support it by saying that failure will never ever take you if your determination towards success is strong enough and keep workng for it. Lets take an example of two students. if two students are assigned a long project in the summer vacation and one student started working from the mean day so that it will be easier from him to complete before the due date whereas the other one kept on realxing thinking that he will start working on it at the last of vacation. Now all of us what the result gonna come. One student happily submitted the project accomplishing it before the due date and the other one had to suffer a lot. So which one would you prefer accomplishing by always doing something in the right time or rushing to complete task in due time. So,in my opinion always doing something to accompish more is better idea than thinking that inactivity also serve a purpose. No one want to rush to complete any task at the due time so we should be always doing somehing to accomplish more. Slow and steady always wins the race but it doent mean to say that doing work slowly will worth it everytime. I mean that you should be always doing something in oder to accomplish in time. We can learn lesson from tortoise and rabbit story. From tortoise side,like topic says we should be always doing something to accomplish more or in time in the same way tortoise kept on walking for the race although he cant run having faith in himself that he can do it. From rabbit side we shouldnt do mistake to think our competetors not strong enough than you. We should always respect your competetors thinking that they are as stronger as you and keep doing our assesments to be the most deserving one of that victory. We should have strong believe in ourselves that I can do it then nothing seems impossible. In conclusion,last but the least I would like to end up saying that if we are always doing something then we can accomplish more compare to the one who works inactively. Time is the most important key factor in our life. Once it is gone it is gone for forever..So,the key point is we should understand the importance of time and utilize it properly and make it effective by always doing something which leads us to the accomplishment of our task.",8,8,8,7,7,7,2471,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
697,1479,4906FE42D823,"Philosopher Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" meaning setting a good example by your own behavior to influence other people. Some say setting a good example is the best way for one to influence others, on the other hand, there are better ways to influence others. The best ways to influence other is to show motivation and to be positive in what is being accomplished. Motivation is a major aspect to those trying to reach or accomplish a certain goal. For example, a person is trying to lose weight and be in better shape to do or a sport in school, but that person isnt feeling motivated to do anything, with even a little motivation by saying ""its going to be tough at the start, but once you feel like giving up ask yourself why you started"" can get that person moving and determined to reach the goal thats being aimed for. Not only is Motivation a huge impact in influencing other, Being positive is a major key to get others moving. Being positive can affect others in a way to get them more influenced. For example, a person is trying to write a song but just cant seem to figure out what or how to write it, stress and anger is taking over but showing the positive can allow that person to relax and have a clear mind on knowing what to write about. Being positive can easily affect those that are around and by saying, thinking, and listening to positive things is can influence so many others. There are millions of other ways to influence people, and it most certainly is the best way to do so. Motivation and being positive can indeed help those who need the influence, even when they cant reach their goal or cant be able to write a certain song, these following reasons have showed how it can help and many more can be done to influence others.",5,6,7,7,6,6,955,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
698,1480,BC0703638937,"Havent you got an advice from multiple adults in your daily life? Most of the times I believe that people ask for multiple advice from multiple people because they want their adive to impact them in a certain way. However, sometimes one person cannot be convinced by one voice they like to hear multiple voices to be convinced. Most often people are not motivated by themselves which would make it harder for them to be motivated by a single voice because those people needs to hear multiple opinions to make them better or motivated. So lets say that this one person likes to change his or her life and become more motivated, be in the best shape of his or her life, so he or she ask about 10 people how to get motivated and how to work hard to achieve your dreams. Hearing motivating and powerful words from other people can impact your life without you even knowing. He gets about the same advice from people as he did from the people before and as he heard all of those people talk about the same topic now he or she would be motivated because sometimes not only one voice but two would put a big impact on someones life and help them. My teachers, friends, family, and all of the people Ive met in my life had gave an advice that I heard and took their advice because it meant something to me and it was deep. I would want more people to give me advice that can impact my life, for example my friends dad always gives him advises but he has hear his dad tell him the same advice over and over again at the end of the day he will get bored and not listen to his dads advice which would impact him negatively. Sometimes life gets hard to certain people and they would like to hear advice from multiple people which will impact them in a positive or a negative way depends on who they ask advice from. For example if I were to ask advice from my brother all the time he would just repeat everything he said from before and that would not help me at all, after all they say ""two brain is better than one."" Listening to other peoples advises can impact you in a way that would make you do the right thing in the future and not only it can impact you it can impact the people around you. You could also use the peoples advises you heard and give that advice to another person that also needs to hear it.

Then how this model is going to help the school if they dont conserve energy and resourse. For instance, teachers are affected in how they give students work when they need some proyect to do how they use energy if they dont have resources. Now left think about if school dont have resourses how students use the restroom if dont have water, students also use water to get a shower went they have a game in the school, another think is that women in the kitchen they need water for cook and give students lounch. However, some students work after school and teachers needs to take care their childres after school or some teachers live very far. Beside, they could affect school education. Lastly, school are affected for many manner this affect whith the hours being to a four day school week in the other hand, let meask abouth disadvantages. Second, students,teachers and employes are affected in the disadvantages. For example, some students work after school if students wants to stay after school maybe they lost their jobs because they dont present to his work or if they have some homework to do after school they can no stay because they need to work studens are affected. Beside, teachers are affected too because after school they need to take care they childrens or maybe some teachers live very far and spend many time for arive to his home. In the other hand, school employes lost his work because if school work only four day at week the drive lost some hours of job this affect some employes and their families. Thats why this dissadvantages affect studens work and students education because some students dont came to the school if they are resposable with his job. However in my case this affect me because i work after school and i need came to the school too but i need some money. They are many reasons why this disadvantages affect students and employees. Let me ask some benefist that is good. Finally should fallow this model by stending four day school week you should have some benefist. For example, you should have one day off to stay at home with family, do the homeworks that the teaches give you or spedn more time to study, teachers can relax one day or maybe they prepare students assignment. In conclution, to conserve energy and resource to considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week, many pleople are affected mostly students and teachers because two hours would affect students job, also the teachers because some teaches live so far from the school and they dont have time to past with his family. In the other hand, the good thing is that they should have one day off and they can relax, students can do their homewors and they can study for his test or maybe they can go to his job in the day off. But is important can to the school every day because we need to learn more every day and in the future can take a better job we can do a good people and a good example for our family.

Growing in life and being successful isnt something thats going to happen over night it takes time and patience.

The mindset of having goals and being passionate about something is a powerful tool, Many immigrants work hard enough to eventually become a U.S citizen which has a lot of obstacles to complete. For immigrants to learn the english language is difficult but after studying and working hard long hours they master it and they tend to grow in the american society, Which shows anyone if you really put your head into it you can accomplish anything.

Many students don not have the resources, time or for others personal reasons to attend schools and this option can be helpful for them to finished the studies. Online classes. This is one of the option for those students that want finished the schools. This option can help them. They can take the classes from theirs home without go to the school and according the time that they have. Time can be a really impediment to attend school, a lot students that leave schools is because they have to work after school and they do not have enough time to do homework or other school activities. They start falling their classes and at the end they diced to leave the school and go to work. Because they may have to feed their families. Family and money can be other reason why the guys leave school some of then came here and don not have any family. so they have to studied and work at the same time to get some money to sent back to their families. But now with this option they can continue with their studies. The other option can be the video conferences. This option also is a good idea to keep studying. Like online classes this also you can take it from your home any time that you want or depend the schedule that the teacher give you. Because on this option you are going to be taken classes in real time with teachers, that you will see each other by camera. This option can be helpful because while you are taking the class, you can talk to the teacher and ask about something that may be confuse you, and keep practice with him like you was in a school classroom. One thing that make this great is that wile you are studying you can keep work and doing personal activities that you usually do. and the good of this program is that not only work for young people, adult also can attend this courses and finished their high school. Because other reason why people leave school is because they are over age or too old to go high school. But with this option you do not have that problem because this involve all people. As we know in this time more and more teenagers are leaving the school. Some of then because do not have other option and others just because they are lazy. But now that the schools are providing this option many student that left school and other people can be benefit with that, and be a easy way for a lot students to finished their studies at get a better future. I think that if more schools provide distance learning as option for the student, more people can get involve and be benefit with this program, and get better opportunities on their life.

In life you live and learn lessons, dealing with stress after stress, or learning that every struggle you faced at the end it will pay off. The key to success in life is having a positive attitude: never envy what others have, nor wish bad upon a person for their success. Trust the process, life will knock you down, get you at your lowest but having that positive attitude towards every struggle and having that positive mindset to others will get you further than you think, having that negative attitude towards everything wont get you far in life: hatred, jealousy, and hard headed wont take you nowhere: in life you are going to face the fact that not everything will go right, and not everything is going to be how you want it. This statement about having a positive attitude is the key to success in life is true, nothing will get you far if you have a negative attitude towards everything that comes your way. If something didnt work out theres always a reason why it didnt went how you expected it, either you decide to work harder to get where you want to get or just give up and not do anything to get you closer where you want to be.

One of the reasons i would not want them to add an hour to school is because if they add an hour to school they would have to add class to the chool to. but one of the main resons that i would not want another hour at school is becuase kids just want to go home and adding an hour would just get kids and parents mad for there kids getting home late. For example if it was day light savings time it would be very dark once every one to go home. Or if a teacher staff memeber or student plays a sport they would be late or unbkle to go for the late releas at the school. In addition if there where to be a lockdown at that hour and a half that the school bored had added the parents of the students might want to sue the school bored for putting there children in danger at the time they added to the day.

Parks are really enjoyable, there is lots of fun stuff to do in a park. There are slides, swings and other fun stuff. There are also animals some times in a park. its like a park and zoo mixed together. people can really enjoy there self in parks. Parks are not only for little kids and there are not always slides,swings, monkey bars etc. in a park. There are some parks that are only made for people who like to jog, run and walk.

For example, when I feeling sad these the form how I can distract me, entertaining and I feeling good because, I can share with other people my passion for soccer. The practice deports can help most students to not consume drugs, or participate in gang. The young need a different world where they can have more opportunity to realize the dreams.

They do not like to be all day in one computer, or landlocked in home, so these the reason that the students like to going school because, they can share with their friends and know new people. For example, when I confused ,or need help with my homework I can ask my teacher, or my partner. we can travel to know the university, teather, and museo. We can learn about our history.

722,1504,188FE8830590,"Is it better to finish high school early? Yes, I would say finishing high school in three years is better. Why? because you can start college early, or go into the work force, and you can have the time to explore the world. By doing this 3 year program, you can start college early. In todays society, finishing school early may be a big benefit. If I had the chance to do this program, I would take that chance. You may be looked at different but in a good way. Also, by starting college early it can be a huge advantage to your future. Finishing school early can bring you into the work force. I would believe by finishing school early, it can be a huge benefit for looking for new jobs. Also, putting on your resume that you graduated early, the employers would look into it and see that you had to take summer and evening classes. You would look your very intelligent and responsible. If having a year off, and dont know what to do, you can explore. If I had that year off I would use the time to see new things, things that ive never seen before. By taking the year off, you would still be on track in your schooling. In life some people dont want to go into school because it is overwhelming. Have the time to go out, if not then youll regret not having that time to yourself. By taking a 3 year course of high school, you can start looking into jobs, have time to explore, and you can start college early. Some say that finishing high school early, you dont get the same high school experience as others that dont do the 3 year program.

726,1508,78DD2317E359,"What Minister Churchill is trying to say is that going from failure to success is not gonna be easy in life. What could they do to reach their career and have success? People will agree with this statement. Not everyone is gonna succeed in life, we all make mistakes. People just got to try harder even if it takes years to achieve. Failure is not the end of the world, people just got to find what is best for them. Going from failure to success in life is not easy, but they just got to have the potential to reach that goal. First, some people may tell others that going from failure to success is a good thing. For example, my friends told someone that playing basketball is not a good sport for him, but overtime he has gotten better at basketball. Most people in the world are gonna say ""practice makes perfect."" Another example is that my sister wanted to go to UVA, and she studied hard to get into that college, my family thought they wouldnt accept it, but a few weeks later, they accepted her in UVA. Things arent gonna be easy, people just got to understand that it is life, we just got to work harder. On the other hand, most people in the world experience this. There is not one person in the world that didnt have any issues throughout their whole life. Even in school, it is very unlikely to find someone that is not having a hard time with there classes. Everyone was not smart when they were born, people got to work for it to get smarter. Here is another example, my Math and History have good grades, but my English and Science dont have good grades, so not everyone is gonna have good grades, people have strengths and weaknesses, they just got to study and work because not everyone is perfect. In addition, some others may say that going from failure to success is a waste of time. Others say that it wont help their career in the future. People think that there is a lot of information in school, college, and even a job that they have to go through just to have success in life. They also say that they have to work hard to pay for their house, their bills, health insurance, car insurance, and even for their family. The people in the world that say that it is a waste of time are the people that can be homeless or the people that just have no life at all. Lastly, the reason why that everyone should always go from failure to success is because its gonna make people feel good about there selves. Another reason why you should be successful is if people finish everything they need for their career, then they dont have to deal with it in the future than having to deal with it later. Also, it is a good idea if they study and learn the materials they could accomplish. Even if people dont succeed in life it is fine because they still have a chance, all they got to do is to study hard and work hard for it because in the future they will not regret it.

The people can be really nice if you take the time to know them. When a person take enough time to know you and try to make a god relationship with you it would change what he or she thinks about you it can change his perspective about you, Some societies judge you because dont Know what kind of people you are and that is because those society dont take the time to look your personality they look at your society conditions and that is bad because it doesnt describe you. In addition if a person is at the lowest point of the society we dont have to judge how munch money they have we got to analyze his personality. An example of this is like when somebody get into a store and that person is not wearing clean and good stuffs we dont have to say that person is a drug addicted maybe that person came from his work to buy something for wife that is something that we got to think. The society can not classify anybody or generalize . All the people has different kinds of mind some people say that the poor people is not educated that they are animals just because they heard something bad about them. That is wrong because all the people is not the same as god people is on this world, bad people is too maybe because somebody did a bad action all that kind of his people is bad too everyone is responsible by his own actions. An example of this is like when a Mexican make a mistake doesnt mean that all the Mexicans are bad, that action says that he was bad but not everyone was bad. Another big example is Generic_School in this school there is many Hispanic people as i, just because a person did something bad doesnt mean that all the Hispanic people does that too. If we help we can change a bad perspective about a person. All the people always got his own problems, some people is going throw bad moment, because we are humans we are not machines that make everything perfect. an example is like when somebody had a bad day and you see that person by the first time in your life then that person do something wrong we can not say that person is a dumb just because he made a mistake we can not say that about somebody else, we can help that person talk with that person and provide our to the person who need it that will help to change our perspective and success as a person. All the people has to have a second chance. The society that we are is a society comprehensive where you as person can make everything possible, you give a second impression about yourself even if you did a person that gave a bad first impressions. An example of this is when a person go out from the jail(everybody says that the people that come from the jail gonna be bad but i don think so,maybe that person went to the jail because he made a big mistake thats bad yes)and that person try to fix his life and try to make himself a god person for the society i as person would give a second chance to that person to show me that he changed a wanna success on his life, that would be really nice. Conclusion: Everyone can change his first impressions of a person giving a opportunity to show that he is a god person even if he did a mistake he would be god for the society.

734,1516,22F571F54234,"Think about a talent or a skill that you have. What did you do to develop that talent or skill? How do you use it? A talent or skill that I have developed is being able to write in cursive. I develop and use this talent in many ways. In order to develop this talent and use this talent, firstly, I had to practice every single day, observe many other people write in cursive, and lastly I use it to sign many different items. One way I developed this skill is practicing. I used to spend everyday writing the whole entire alphabet in cursive to perfect how I wrote. I would meet up with my teacher after school everyday for about a month so that she could help me work on my writing. Another thing that I did was rewrite every document or letter that I saw or received to accomplish writing as good as the original writer. Another way I developed this skill is by observing other people. I would watch many ""How To"" YouTube videos to observe how other people wrote. I would observe how they wrote and I would write very similar to them. Whenever I saw anybody writing in cursive I would study their hand movements and match mine up to theirs to achieve writing perfectly. Any letters that I had received from family members I would examine to figure out how they wrote in such a perfect manner. One way I have used this skill is by signing my name on many different items. Anytime that I go to the doctors office I get asked to sign my name and knowing cursive comes in handy. Whenever I decide to write letters to my family I sign my name on the outside of the envelope so they know that its from me. Also, anything I have painted or drawn has my name signed on it. Think back at a skill or talent that you have. How did you develop it? How do you use it? Mine is being able to write in cursive.

To see the good side of the things in life help to be successful. A positive attitude is the key to success in life because a positive attitude will help not to give up and will make things easier. First, a positive attitude is the key to success in life because being positive help no to give up. For example, in the text ""People Who Became Successful After Adversities"", many people had a hard time before becoming successful.

The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life. Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life. To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through.

736,1518,FFD9A83B0849,"Working alone, students do not have to argue with other about decission of their proyects and have to work with someone they do not know; however, most students prefer to work as a group because students are able to dived work, to share ideas and to help each other. Working with a group allows students to work more efficiently. Personally and due to the facts, I would prefer to work with a group because working with other is more beneficial for students. Firstly. Most students are required to do many proyects during each marking period which is to much for each student, and specially when there is a big proyect for each class that worth 10% of the periods grade, but working with a group the proyect might be diveded to each person in the group, and share between them. Each student have different and unique qualities that can be helpful to do do certain parts of proyects that for other can be difficult to do. Secondly. Working with a group might be also seen as opportunity for student of gaining values of cooperation which is important to have due to many companies assign jobs to two or more people to realize them because of the different knowledges they can provide to each other. Companies usually use the phrase: ""Work as a team"" to make their productivity more efficiently. Teachers should see this as way of helping students to get expiriences of working as team, and also that way, we as students would get knowledge of others. By allowing students to work with group teacher might be helping student to get more confident about their due to the fact that students can disscuss betweend eache other the topics and loook forward the best way of doing them. Schools are allowing students to stay after school which is perfectly fine for those students that are not able to go to a house of one the members of the group. A group might be also helpful for those students that are having issues turning their work on time because; now, they can get be supported by other and be more productive. To conclude, No students should be in the position of having a big proyect with no enough time without the opportunity of work with a groups. Many companies are assigning jobs to be done by more than one person, they know that a team works more efficiently than one person, and teachers should do the same in their classes to help students to get their grades up, and also to be productive on turning work in. Working with a group should be allowed for students during classes to improve their qualities of coorperation and to have different points of view to do the best for subject.",8,8,8,8,7,6,3908,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

738,1520,F4FC2D64C127,"Inactive Times and Its Benefits Should people have inactive times in their life? By doing work all the time people can achieve more goals; however, is better for people to have inactive times. It is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy. Firstly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life. Peoples body works better when they have time to rest. For example, my mothers friend had a heart attack for not having inactive times. His doctor recommend him to have lazy times because he was working eighteen hours per day, but he did not listen to what the doctor said. As a consequence, he pass away; however, before he was told to have inactive times, his Neuron System stopped working properly. He stared having bad times at night while he was sleeping, his body started shaking, and he started having heavy breathing. The doctor asked my mother to talk to him and explained one of bad results, and that was death. Right after my mothers friend pass away, the doctor wrote on his blog about how not having inactive times can kill us. In sum, having inactive times help people live a longer life. Secondly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have fresh ideas. When our brain is full of tasks we cannot think clearly and have new ideas. Being busy makes our mind blocked. For example, Generic_Name is a teacher and she is planning to have a party. However, Generic_Name is been so busy because her class is having a competition. All she thinks about is the competition and how to prepared her class. Generic_Name is not having inactive times and she does not know how to organized the party. She tried to focused on the party, but each small action was in vane. Her boss noticed she was tired and did not have new ideas, so her boss let her have two days off. During those two day Generic_Name could came up with lots of ideas to her party and also ideas to the competition. Generic_Name was happy because her main was full of new and fresh ideas. Her class won the competition and her party was amazing. In conclusion, by having inactive times people can get fresh ideas. Thirdly, it is better for people to have inactive times because they get more energy. People who rest feel more energetic to start or finish an activity. For example, when I have many homework ,exams coming up, and track practice I feel upset, frustrated, and with no energy. So what I do is rest for a while to get energy. This make me feel powerful and energetic to finish my different activities. Furthermore, in my Psychology class I learned that people who rest or get an inactive time after they done with an activity for twenty five minutes have more energy to continue another task. In my personal experience, I have tested it on my sister and the results were successful. For example, She had to do an Algebra II homework and then, an English homework. So when she took the first twenty five minutes after she finished her first homework she said, she had energy to do the other one. We test it again without having twenty five minutes break. She said she was tired to do the next homework because she did not have energy. In sum, it is better for people to have inactive times because get more energy. In conclusion, it is better for people to have inactive times because they can have a longer life, fresh ideas, and get more energy. People can faced catastrophic result as death by not having inactive times and affect our life time. In addition, when people have lazy times they can came up with new ideas to complete different tasks. Finally, when people rest a certain time after an activity they get more energy. Each individual on earth must have an inactive times. ",6,8,7,8,7,8,3639,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

We all have a instict on where we look at some people and judge but we also see the attitude in the people. First impressions are special sometimes because you dont know who you are going to meet next and on how they are good or if they have some bad in them. Everybody is unique in many different ways. People do say that first impressions is impossible to change. I think its impossible becuase people are very different everybody is different and sometimes we just have to accept it. Some people dont understand that some people cant change even if its for the better or the worse some people will just always be the same.

People do anything on phones, but it has negative things to using them a lot: dating people through text, and less communication in real life and more over text. While most people believe that technology has positive effects in reality, it is mostly a negative effect. Technology is not a good thing in certain situations. It is better to get to know people in person rather than social media or anything. No one knows who someone is until they meet them in person because some people lie to make someone like them. Technology can hurt people in different ways: physical, emotional, or any other way. People tend to do things to hurt the other person online rather than to their faces.

I agree with this writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing something. the second reason that I agree is that I think we can accomplish more if we are always doing something. Lastly but not less I think that inactivity also can serve a purpose. The firs reason that I agree with Thomas Jefferson writing because it is wonderful how much can be done if we are always doing some thing. What I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to say was that if we help others we wold be doing a lot for others. For example if we see someone that is tring to cross the street and they cant do it by them self because of a bad weather or because that person has a disability you should help that person because belive it or not you would make that person day. I also belive that Thomas Jefferson writing stans out for those people that dont have a home or a family y that can suport them if you can try to make that person day better by getting them a some water or food. I also belive by bing nice to people you could make there day better because you dont know if that peson had a bad day at work or something bad hapen. Seconly I agree with THomas Jefferson writing because we can accomplish more if we are always doing some thing. For exampel if you are tring to pass a class or a SOL try your best and no matter how much you fell get up and get up stronger and keep tring. I think it also meen that is that if you are working and you dont know how to do it ask for help like that the next time you do it you can do it better. I think Thomas Jefferson was tring to tell us not to givre up. Lastly but not less I belive that inactivity also can serve a purpose. Inactivity also can serve a purpose because if some one is provoking you and you jump up and keep it going then there can be some problems. For example if you are at work and some one provoke you and you reack to the provoke you could lose your job. If you get in troble because some one you and you keep the problem going it can afect you later on when you going to get a new job because they going to see that you cant control your self. Thats why i think if you go an talk to your boss when some one is causing you problems is better if you react an you lose your job for not contlroling your self. In conclution I think we should help any one that needs the help and not just think that they would be fine because we dont konw what they been throug and we would like for some one to help us when we are in troble or when we are not dong well.

750,1532,98D8723E86D0,"Should you start looking for career before you enter high school? Will it help you out and help you get a job that way, and is it important to set goals while your in high school and try to reach those goals in the future? All those questions are important to me because on my opinion those are ways to succeed in life. Those questions can help you in the future if you use them. Knowing what you would like to do in the future can help you out because your school might have classes or after school clubs for it. Yes it is important for young student to start looking for a career before they enter highschool. Why is it important? Its is important because if students know what they want to do in future, they can take classes in high school to help them do that career. For example if I wanted to be a mechanic, I could take auto collision in edison, and that would start to help me out and give me experience. Knowing what you want to be in the future can help you out a lot, and you do what you like to do, and on my opinion knowing what you want your career to be gives you a advantage in the future. For some people it isnt a problem to go to high school without know what there going to do in the future. They try to find out what what they like, and what they dont like as a career for the future. Some people go to college not knowing what they want to do and find out till there in college. My sister is one of them because she went into college not knowing what she wanted to do or be, but once she started going to college she found out what she wanted to do which was a ultra sound doctor. Now that she knows what she wants to do she studying and trying to reach her goal as being a ultra sound doctor. If you already have a mindset on what you want to do you can set goals for yourself, and once you reach those goals set harder ones to reach. You can set many types of goals like one day owning a 5 bedroom house or owning your dream car. You can set goals with what ever you want like in the future, present, at school , anywhere. If your still in school a goal you can set is getting a and b honor roll or turning in all your work or even showing up to class everyday. One of my goals is to own my first car before I graduate which is a Lexus Is300 2001.

Financial issues has become one of the problem in this generation of mankind, whereby students either have to pay to live on campus or out of campus to further their education,which has caused a lot of students out of school dorms because, they struggle to pay for them. Most students have daily jobs to help them afford to pay the bills, based on their level of education. Working and schooling is a difficult task on students because, one have to make time for school and work to be able to make everything easier and stress free. Transportation and parking space has also been an issue for some reason, why some students prefer to take online classes from home to prevent them from being late to class. Colleges with large mass of land may not have enough parking space for students and we also believe that, not every student own a car or any type of moving vehicle where by one needs to park. when one is being able to attend classes from home, they get the chance to begin their lesson anytime during day after a long stressful day. Students benefit from being able to attend classes online from home because, they accomplish more and get worked done faster in due time. With less distractions, they understand and enjoy the lesson, it helps them concentrate and more focus on what is being taught to them. They get to ask questions online, they also get more time to go over the lesson again to the right state of understanding the lesson. Lecturers reduce a lot on online students with less work and projects for them to have be ready for other assignments being given to them. Taking classes online or video conferencing gives one enough to take care of other things, to be on time for lectures, help other students that couldnt go to college to feel they also have the right to achieve their goal once in a life time and to help others without transportion save money and more organised and time managment.",5,6,6,6,5,6,2056,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

If the student offer distance learning, First he must have to talk to his counsoler about doing classes online and disscus with her about he can stay home and do the classes online. Second, the students have to take test before they do the classes online because the teachers or another people from the school can see if he really is going to do the work at home and be prepaed for all the work that the teacher will give to him/students. Finally, the teachers will see and talk to his counsoler or administrator if they do good in the test and see if they can saty at home and do the classes online also the teacher should give a recomendation to the students if they have to take classes online. The students will have some benefits if they take classes online, First, the students obiasly will have benefit because they will be doing all work at home and they can ask for help to his/her brothers or sister at home and they can help to do the work and if they have a test in the class that he is taking he will pass because he can see the notes or some works that he finished before. Second, They will have benefit because they are not going to school and he can go out during the day and also do the work when theyre out. Finally, Students also will have benefit because they can do the work whenever they want bacuse if they have the classes online at the computers is more easier for example, if they only have to take notes they only can see another attachment of the same thing and if they have a test they will see the notes or another paper about the test. Students will have benefits with the grades. Firts, the students will have good grades because they will have a lot of time do the work that is assigment for the next day or the same day and they will be concentrate because they are going to be alone at home. Second, The students will have a lot of benefit in that because they can see some work abouth the assigment and have a 100 points in the assigment or if they have a project that the students who are in the school they only will have a hour to do it because the others teacher will give a lot of homework to them but the student whp is taking classes online he will have a lot of work too bute he will have all the day to do it or the next day.

Why getting other peoples opinions can help someone make a better choice or think of a better choice is because, people can tell you the same thing but in a different wording.

Having more opinions does help a lot because they could make someones choice more beneficial and help someones way of thinking about better choices, having less people wouldnt really want to persuade someone to make better choices and it wouldnt be that make someone think of a better choice. The more opinions people give someone, the more likely the choice will be or they will think of a better choice. Opinions can persuade someone to make a better choice because a good friend or a good person can give his opinion that would make someone want to make a better choice having lots of good opinions can benefit someones choice and make better choices. Having two or one opinion doesnt persuade someone to make better choices but having five or eight people could make someone want to make better choices because people can be very persuasive and some people wouldnt really listen or care what one or two people say but if its at least five or more then there is chance of that someone might listen or even care because lots of friends and family or even teacher want that someone to make better choices and he or she cant just ignore that unless they want to make bad choices.

766,1548,0AD69388300B,"One topic that is frequently debated today is whether students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Some people taking classes from home is more helpful. They feel like they have more time to do extra activities throughout the day. I believe that going to school is better because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities. First reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to experience the real world. When you go to school you have to wake up early to get ready and make it on time to school, in the other hand when you are home schooled you get to wake up at whatever time and still do your work, that is not experiencing the real world because life it is not always going to be like that. School makes you experience the real world by so many ways. When you are at school you work in groups with other people and that is getting you ready for when you grow up and have to work with other people at your job. Second reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to make friends. When going to school you get to interact with people and make new friends, in the other hand when you are at home you do not interact with anyone it is only you by yourself. Having friends is really good, they can help with what they can. At school you can ask your friends for help in a subject when you do not understand something. Third reason, why I think going to school is better than taking classes at home is that you get to enjoy all the school activities. School activities are one of the favorite things about school that students like. If you are home schooled you do not get to enjoy them and have fun with your friends. When going to school you get to enjoy senior night, school dances, and extra curricular activies, which are super fun. As you have read, I believe that going to school is better than taking your classes from home because you get to experience real world, you get make friends, and you get to enjoy all the school activities. School teaches you most of the things that you know and need in life at the end of the day. On that day we are going to realize on why we need school so much.

767,1549,14ED79D68BC4,I think if we never try something new we will never are going to grow more. Im agree with Emersons because in this life the point is to try new ideas new experiences is not only stay in one place like if I already have something why cant try something different if I can move more far than where I am for example if I never try something that I always have wanted how am going to know what its feel. One reason if I already have a mastered in something how im supossively to grow if I never have try it before how I will know if I am good for it Ifor not I never try before. Example If I am a person who has a mastered in bussines and I am able to have my own company but Iam scared to try how I am supposively to grow If I dont try I will stay in the same place where I srtart because is does not matter what I am mastered fpr it if I dont try I f I dont take the risk if I am not confident in my self. Unless I try to do something that I already have mastered I will never grow. I think everything depends in our own personallity because there are person that they are already old but some times they regret their selfs because they never try somethint that they could try it when they were young but now is to late for them I think those kind of things are important in life is not only a bachilletor degree is what you want in life is something that if you dont try is gonna stay in our lives forever and we wiil never are going to see that. Another example for this is that we always have to go beyond that what we already know we never can stop in one place we need to keep going because there are more things to discovered and the more fast we are moving the more fast we start growing it. So every time we need to keep in mind that everything that we do is what is going to make us to look different then others and always be beyond in everything. ,5,6,6,5,5,5,283,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
768,1550,D610B092DAD9,If you where a high schooler would you know what you would want youer career to be ? Some say that students are expected to know to the career that they want to have so that they take specific class for that career. So that it could help them acive or get closer to the career that they want. All though some say that high schools students should not be expected to know what specifice career they want. Frist peopel tented to chang over time so somthing that you might have liked three years ago you might not like that much anymore. Second you cant really telll if you like somthing intell you try it. Lets say that Generic_Name has wanted to be a teacher her whole life but then she gets the job and finds out that she is not that happy with her job and that she should have tryed other class in high school. Finaly most student dont really think about thier careers intill the last two years of high school. actuily all students should know what they want thier career to be by the time they are in high school. Frist if student where to know what they want there career to be they could take specific class for that career. By students not having to take other class that they dont need it would help them focuse more because they whouldnt have to worry about having to take or study for a test in a class that they dont need. Finally if a student was to be taking class that he/she wants they would show up to class more because they would be intersteded. Thats why I belive that students should know what career they want when they get into high school. Because it would help them out and even make thier life esay. Even if that idea was to chang but it all ways good to have a goal so that you can acive it.,6,7,6,6,6,4,2984,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
769,1551,B4994C771190,"Do you think that students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I dont think the students would get benefits from being able to attend clasess from home. First, the students not have somebody like a teacher to tell what to do and no body give pressuare. For example: if the student dont want to do what the student have to do no body tells nothing. Second, the student who takes oline classes will not have any friends or somebody to talk. For example: Everybody want any friend or somebody who can we talk if you do stay at home you never meet someone and never know somebody. Third, the student maybe can get frustate to be lonely at home. For example: if the student take oline classes and watch videos conferencing maybe will be boring and the studend get stress in another part if the student take the classes at school he be with friends or somebody to talk. Next, if the student stay at home the student can do whatever the student want to do. For example: if the student want to play video games the student can do that and if the student want to sleep he can do that too because the student will not feel with any responsability also, if the student wants to go outside he can do that because the student will be at home and maybe their parents work all day. Finally, if you take the classes at home and never came to school you cannot live the experinces that we live at school. For example: if you take a classes at home you cannot participate in any activity that the school have like a any sport or party or any activity that one is so funny and you can enjoy the activities with you friend or teachers who always are there for us to lisen if you have any problem and the techer are like a secret box because you can tell whatever you want and they never tell to someone. Thats why I think is nice to get classes at school and I think is not so good to take classes at home because you can get more fun at school and is a experince that you will never forget. In another part if you did not want to get school because someboby bother you like if another student tell you a nickname that you di not like maybe can be a reason that you did not want came to school but you can took with you adviser or yours parents because every body have a opportunity to be at school and anybody cant tell you anything.

772,1554,81D266D94D6D,"Do we get astonished when people behaviors change over time? This makes us surprised and wonder because of their first impressions to us. I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. People changes all the time just like how the world moves every second. First impressions are possible to change. A behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. A persons character is similar to how a pregnancy grows. When a woman is pregnant, you may be unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show. People hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want. In todays world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in modern societies. Needs are the most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. In the movie, a man named Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldnt cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he meets the first time. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family. You see how poverty makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time. Sometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change. Marriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. No one gets married to his or her nemesis so bad pressures from our partners affect our characters. Depression makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Two years ago, I met a girl called Generic_Name. She was so isolated and sad. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesnt mean that is how they are. People change all the time. Peer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level. You will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail and every teacher wants to be awarded by the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time. ""Every coin has two faces"" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them. How a person behaves the first time you meet them may change all the time. And if we understands how the world is moving every seconds we all going to get peace!

773,1555,DEDCC703F6FC,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high students to gradute in three years instead of the traditional four years. In my opinion, I feel like it is a good idea for some school districts to allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. The reason on why I feel like it is a good idea for students to graduate early is for Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving other places and starting a whole new life without no worries on education no more. Job oppurtunitys will help you out to save money, working on what you like doing and also find some jobs can help you get into college if you are interested. For example, I am studying about autotechnology and it is my second year doing it. My plans are to continue working on cars and hopefully find a job at a dealership so I can learn enough at college. Another reason on why I feel like allowing students to graduate in three years instead of four is so that they can start off there future earlier than others by attending college. Entering college early is a good thing because you have some time to pick and decide on what you might want to study and learn about so you can get your masters on it or so that you can finish early and move onto whats next on your accomplishments in life. My school has the option to do Dual Enrollment which basically means starting college already and getting already college credits and still having to be in high school. Finally, another reason on why I feel like graduating high school earlier than others is to have the chance to move to another country or state and start a brand new. Starting a brand new life can become very hard and very stressful. Starting a new life moving somewhere else means finding a better job oppurtunity, finding a olace to live in your budjet and also finding new people to hang around with but in my opinion at the end it will all be worth it. Some students are already looking somewhere to move on there own or with a roomate because they might be having problems at home that they dont want to deal with. At the same time of moving to another place you have to make sure that you are ready on whats about to come into your life. For example, paying bills, paying rent, house supplies and also if you have a vehicle make sure that your payments are on time. In conclusion, I feel like allowing high school students to graute in three years instead of the traditional four years is a good idea. Job oppurtunity, Entering college early and also Moving to another state or country in my opinion are one of the main important things to focus on after finishing high school.",8,7,7,6,7,7,3169,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

776,1558,A1D0490FD324,"I am writing about should students work in schools or their homes. Most people think its best for kids to be in school than in their homes because it can help them in their social life, make friends in there world instead of being lonely. Even though lots of students like to work at home, I strongly believe its better to work at schools. Students should have friends in there lives to be more social in the world. When I was younger I use to switch schools to schools then I went to a school called Generic_School I was the only new kid in school I had no friends I was the quite in class, then one day I join a club called book club we just read books and talked about what happen in them. Then one of the kids came up to me and ask what do you like I told him what I love like animals, sports. Those were the things we both like too he was my first friend in that school. Students should be in schools because they should be comfortable when meeting, talking with other students because they might have things in common. At school students can help each other out in class if they dont understand something. For example, In history there are students that dont understand they would just sit in their seats and not ask for help. One day I saw a student frustrated with work so I decided to help him in America Civil War. When we took our test we both got As. In my class students can be helped by fellow classmate or the teacher. During school projects students can be in partners or in groups to get a good grade. In my science class we have projects to do we get in a group of friends to get a good grade and we see a student work by him self. When we got our projects back we got an A and the student got a B. This shows that in schools we should be with other students to bring in ideas, ways that others cant see. In school you can be well taught and understand better when people like teachers, or other students help them.

So many students see high school as an embergo, high school literally takes four years that alot of time, we could be out there gaining expreinces from being in the workforce and actually studying what we want to do, i also feel like highschool dont really focus on what the students actually want to do, we take classes that we wont even need after high school.

For example let take a look at bill gates he was a smart kid in highschool, he also use to sneak to the college libary to do his work, because he felt like high school didnt offer him the amount of knowledge he needed so he decided to drop out of high school, and has you can see his on of the top billionairs in the World. What if there is a kid like that in highschool and he/she felt like highschool is not giving him the amount of knowledge he needed and he wants to graduate early but he cant do that because, were required to take four years of everything, and its totally not fair. When i decided to graduate early, both my counselors and teachers where discouraging me that i shouldnt do it, that colleges frown at those type of stuff and all that, but they didnt know that i already made up my mind and i felt like i was ready to take on the world all by myself without the help of my parents. In conclusion i think three years of highschool should be encouraged alot in highschool, so kids can go out there and explore and live their dreams and actually study what they want to study. And they shouldnt really make students take boring courses like history for four years of high shool non stop. Im very happy to say that im class of 2020!! instead of 2021, And im very happy that i took that road.",6,5,7,7,5,5,2308,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
780,1562,1B622A28EDD9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very benificial, because you wouldnt have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. Youd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you wont have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldnt have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well. Id like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you dont pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when your at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldnt have to worry about this. Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would by that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better. My final reason would be less stress. I say this because Im stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get to much homework and most of the times I dont get time to do it because of work or family. Im the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyones ok. Making me not do homwork after school. Most of the times I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldnt have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed. I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but thats during class after class its nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something and you wont be able to have someone to help. At school we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disavantages. I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has there own way of learning. If your more of a independant person than I would recommend taking online classes but if your more of a social person than stay in school. All that matters is that you pass your class.",8,7,9,8,7,7,360,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
781,1563,A0B8C1FA3811,"I think the students should not be allow to use their cell phone in classroom, the effects of allowing them is not going to be useful comparing to how it will take their attention from their class work to the online world of cell phone. The reasons that most schools have free computer or laptops for all students for educational purposes, and distracting other students, teachers, and the student, who does as well, with out even knowing that . Most or every school has too many online items for student to use for example, in my school we use laptop and iPad as a main educational resources to do the class work. Using the school resources with free internet, and that allow teachers to know what is everyone doing and help them if they need to. Also, that most schools have a libraries have a lot of the best free educational recourse for all students, so that make students have too many options instead of using their own cell phones in classroom. Moreover, using cell phone in the classroom would distract others students with their class work for example, I prefer using the outline resource instead of the online once, so I can not focus to my class work when students use their cell phones around me. Also, using cell phone in the classroom could be less useful compare to how it could take students attention to the cell phone Social Medea world or the online world, so if one student didnt use the cell phone in the right way or for an educational purposes all the classrooms people, teacher and students, wold be distract out of their subject and lose their class time. Others people might have another opinion about that, for example the can say using the cell phone is useful for student for educational purpose and contact family. That can be right when we can be sure that all teenager students would do this. Also that every school has a free phone for students to contact their families if their is a need. Therefore, using cell phone in the classroom is less use that its, because that would wast all classs time, and students have more options to search online for their class work. We all must respect peoples, teachers, and our time in classroom by not use cell phone to distract and lose the attendances benefit in classroom.",7,6,7,7,5,5,2152,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

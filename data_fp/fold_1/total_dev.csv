0,1818,6E70CECCE25D,"One topic is frequetly debated is whether or not should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? some people think that because students can learn more. They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more. One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and dont distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they dont listening to the teacher while shes explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she dont say anything when we are using our phones. Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read. Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they dont have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and thats one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i dont have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and thats why i dont do your homework. The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases. In conclusion why the school days can extending two hours is because most students want to stay in the school to participated in activities of the school or participated in some football teams.",6,7,6,6,5,7,1440,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
1,3305,7B802407D629,"We choose our own character traits. One character trait is kindness, someone who is very kind and friendly to everyone. my second character trait is rudeness, this is someone is usually not nice to others. My third and final character trait is helpfulness, someone who is always looking to help others. I chose all of these character traits, as i felt these are all traits that people choose themselves. The act of kindness is someone who is very kind and friendly, its one of many character traits. A lot of people choose to have this as their character traits, and most have it for a good reason. It should be said that people are not born kind, they choose their own traits that fits them best. Some choose to be kind after seeing how some people can act so different towards other people, or their parents just simply raised them to be kind. This character trait is a very common character trait, and i hope more people is it in the future. Rudeness is a somewhat uncommon character trait used by a small number of people. Not everyone is going to be a good person, some are rude all of the time for no apparent reason. A lot of people are rude because they are most likely going through something, or thats just the trait they had growing up. I know a lot of rude people, teachers and students, most are rude just because thats the trait they decided to choose. My final thoughts on rudeness is that not everyone is rude, but theres always gonna be that small amount of rude people in the world. The helpfulness trait is of my most favorite traits. Helpfulness is when someone who is always looking to help someone in need, and also make sure they get the help they deserve. I am a helpful person myself, i try to help people with their problems if i can. A person who is helpful is like that as they have always been like that, and just want to help anyone in need. The world is a much better place with helpful people, i hope they dont go anywhere. My counter claim is that our character is actually formed by influences beyond our control, and that we learn from these influences what our trait really is. I say this is false, we are supposed to choose our character traits, and they are what makes us who we are. We choose our own character traits. One example of a character trait is the act of kindness, a person who is friendly to all the people that comes their way. A second example of a character trait is rudeness, these types of people are generally rude to everyone that comes their way. A third example of a character trait is helpfulness, a person who wants to help others in any way. I have chosen these character traits as they are the most commonly used character traits.",6,6,6,6,7,6,1629,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

One thing about this world is not to rely on someone, because everyone is doing everything to survive. Example if youre not able to make your decision, you will always depend on someone and at the end of the day the person will fail you. Thats why is very important to make your own decision.

3,2501,D2910C3C8E3B,"I agreed with Auther Ralph Waldo Emerson "" Unless you try to do somthing beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" which is ture. Hard working pays you back! Some people think they become rich by nature, every time knowledge need to upgrade ,and to keep our wealthy life need to work hard. First reason, most of the time people think they become rich by nature. Which means they become well to do when they born. I personally do not support this idea because behind every success they is a hard working. For example United State of America is number one powerfull country in the world but, before America got that name their was a lots of scrifice. In my opinion If we dig the ground and we found the piece of gold that is not wealth that is a sign of destination, that means until we got the gold reservoir do not stop excavate. Second reason, when a year change lots of thing change. For instant knowledge. Now adays tecnology descover the world. In this case every time knowledge need to upgrade. If you have degree in the filed of IT in 2016 and, still you did not upgrade your knowledge you are out of the game. The system or the caricullem is change so fast so we need to ajest our speed to run with the generation. If we need to grow what we have, we need to try somthong. Inaddition, to keep our wealthy life we need to work hard. For example Bill Gate is wealthy man in America he have everything house,car and money. Bill gate does not say I have everything I do not need to work after this time. He is working hard like us. Because unless he did something to grow his wealth he will going to lose what he have. This is real life by any means if we stop trying we lose everything work, food, money, and family. The key is work hard do not Give Up. In conclusion, we need to do somthing or try our best to live our wonderfull life. I strongly support Author Ralph Waldo idea. Dreams are not somthing to wait for; they are somthing to work for. Which means works are the rode to get our dreams. Today is a great day to learn somthing new.",7,6,6,6,6,4,2921,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
4,3656,BDA991AF3ABE,"Thomas Jefferson once wrote ""determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I strongly agree with this quote for many reasons. If youre not doing something to help you get better, youer failing, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life, and inactivity does not serve a purpose to this quote. Although, others may think different and disagree with this quote, other people in this world needs this motivation. If youre not doing something to help you get better, youre failing. This role plays a huge part of others because failing is not a choice. You may fail a couple of times on this and that but what are you doing to not fail again? If something isnt right and want to fix it, do something about it. In the other hand, doing something for a purpose makes you succeed in life. I play baseball for 10 years now and my goal is to make it to the big leagues but with this being my goal, I have to do something to help me achieve my goal. Success is not giving to you, you have to earn that success and by that, do something to help you succeed your dream. At the end, inactivity does not serve a role in this act. Inactivity is getting in the way of you not achieving and succeeding. I take inactivity as a negative act because I dont want to be sitting at home or anywhere not doing something to help me get better. Be the one who changes your life by doing what it takes to do something in life to reach your highest goals. Let this quote be a inspiration of achieving and succeeding in life or at anything. Be the one that can make a change. Doing something makes you accomplish more. It takes effort and hard work to do something but at the end, it all pays off. Only you can change yourself whether you want to be successful or not.",7,7,8,8,7,7,2553,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
5,33,FD7DC289E98E,"Many students involve themselves in a lot of school activities to enrich their educational experience, some Students can also learn responsibility, because the students can choose how many activities they would like to do. The students could also feel more mature by having to talk with their parents to do any activity after school. Students also have the opportunity to make lots of friends by joining clubs or doing sports. Although if the school controlled the students involvement of doing any activity, the students would have a limit of joining a certain amount of activities after school. That could help the student not stress about all the responsibility they would have to do. The school also makes students have good grades in other to join a club or sport, which helps the students focus on school assignments first. However letting the school control a student, would make the student struggle with responsibility and communication with people. If a student wants to play a sport and be in a club after school because the student wants to make friends, they shouldnt be limited to joining just one by the school. Instead the student should be allowed to choice and join as many clubs or sports they would like. It would help the student to communicate with people without them being scared or shy to talk to someone. Going out of their comfort zone early would also help a student with finding and working for a job. Communication is one of the most important things in a daily life, and if a student cant join an activity because of their grades, how would the student be able to talk to someone if their scared too. Joining a lot of activities after school, helps a student with responsibility. When a student is involved in a lot of activities, they learns to use their time wisely and would help them later in life for when they are working. It would also help with daily events like taking out the trash, washing their dishes, cleaning their room, and doing their school assignments. Since they have to be doing well in school to even be doing after school activities. Responsibility is something a student should learn in a early age, and should have during school and after they graduate from high school and even collage. If a student is committed to doing all the activities they chose to have, they will do great. Not only will they feel good about themselves, but that will make their parents proud and show them that they ready to be independent. That would also look good for when the student signs up for a collage they would like to go to, but also for when they get a job. When someone is committed to their job, their boss will notice that they really wanna work and could even get a raise. Commitment will help a student, because if they believe they can do a lot of school work and do lots of activities, They will feel great about themselves at the end of their high school career.

The majority of students that I have asked about it say that working in group has been more succesful for them because in fact it is way faster,you get to share your ideas and support others. Many times that I have worked on something by my self I always wonder about many things or opinions about my work and it is hard for me to check if it is good or what would people think about my work. It is also benefitial for teachers because students will have less questions for them,so teachers can use that time for grading or other things while the students are working in group. I have seen some teachers having a hard time grading and explaining at the same time because every single student is working by their own. Teachers must have their students working in a group than alone because as I see it is more benefitial and better,this will have students to come up with better work and they also get to interact with diferent people and learn from them.",8,8,7,7,8,8,1059,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
7,3206,1D327ADD95AA,"Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on peoples lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started. Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. Peoples phones, computers, and even TVs now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted. Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era. People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed. Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.",9,8,10,9,9,9,386,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
8,2486,CBCA3CFF320B,"Boom!One day PROPER_NAME mom decided that she wanted him to join the distance learning classes.Where they could have online or video conferences with there school teachers.PROPER_NAME would sit around all day on his phone playing videos games instead of doing his online or video conferences.PROPER_NAME is like many others who thinks school is not all that important.I believe that schools should not offer distance learning to students.Therefore,students would not benefit from attending classes at home because students would have more free-time, students would be discourage that school is not important,Also they would skip classes to meet up with friends. First,students would have free-time.For example,PROPER_NAME was home alone because her mom and dad works at a fast-food restaurant called LOCATION_NAME.PROPER_NAME knows she would have online conferences in the morning the next day at 8:30.Next morning came PROPER_NAME decided that she was not doing any conferences because she wanted to go shopping at the mall for a up coming beach day that her aunt PROPER_NAME was having.PROPER_NAME then spend all day at the mall walking around looking in stores and talking to friends.Another example,There was a Vybz Kartel performance in LOCATION_NAME where they would give away free food and drinks at the gate. PROPER_NAME mom make sure to call home and remind her that she would have video conference in the afternoon with the teacher she loves the most PROPER_NAME but there was no answer so her mom decided to leave a voice mail ad hope when she sees the message she will know what to do. PROPER_NAME then left home after listing to her moms voice mail saying that she needs some alone time so she have to attend this party because all her friends were going and she wanted not to feel left out.Additional, PROPER_NAME boyfriend PROPER_NAME texted her saying he want to spend the day with her because he was leaving on October the 26,to go and stay for sum time in LOCATION_NAME with his dad. PROPER_NAME then got up pack a bag with clothe then left without anyone know she was out of the house without studying for her online conference presentation.c Secondly,students would skip classes to meet up with friends.For example, PROPER_NAME skip distance learning classes to go enjoy the day with her best friend PROPER_NAME because it was his birthday and he invites her out for ice-cream and horse back riding. In addition, as for PROPER_NAME hanging out with his friends skiing in glove on snowboard or ice hockey is way cooler then staying home listening to his online conference teacher talk. Another example, PROPER_NAME dad PROPER_NAME just brought this new speedboat.one day when her dad was not at home she decided it is better not to do her online or video conference she was just going to invite sum of her friends over and they could take the boat for a spin at a hotel called HOTEL_NAME.They spent all day boating around instead of her doing her online classes.Another example, PROPER_NAME woke up one Monday morning saying she doesnt feel like she has a need to be taking distance learning classes so she pack her bag and call her friend PROPER_NAME to go with her to the countyside to look on lakes,mountain,and also valley. Lastly,students would get discourage that school is not that important.For example, PROPER_NAME was taking AP biology class because she wanted to be a doctor, but because her mom start letting her taking online conferences for biology and start staying home she get discourage that school is not that important because if it was why would they would her to stay her.Next example, PROPER_NAME wanted to be a color guard coach but her aunt was telling her she does not have enough money to pay for her to attend the color guard practices her aunt heard about this distance learning program where she could stay home and learning about the skills for color guard for free. PROPER_NAME decided that if that could help she would take the class after two days PROPER_NAME said to her mom that the distance learning is not working out the way she wanted it to be also that is lower her expectation about school.Some people believe that if school offer distance learning to students it would allow them to have freedom.They are incorrect because most students are responsible.",5,6,7,6,6,6,2781,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
9,1949,77A31D0A07A8,"Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote,""unless you try to do something beyound what you have already mastered , you will never grow "". Based on mine on experiences, I disagree with Emersons statement. Because people grow up every single day, people learn new things from things they mastered in,and people grow no matter what they in . Firstly,people learn new things everyday. when it comes to studies and growing, alot of people try their best to master in what they are trying to do. Most people spend more time to mastered in what they want to do but the more you study the more you grow knowing all kinds of things. For example,when I first move to America, it was hard for to master or get used to the culture ,food ,speaking but the more I learn more about the country the more i grow in it. now if I tell you can speak english good you will not believe it. you do need to move beyound what have mastered in to grow .Because you can mastered in math but you dont know the whole thing about stuff. so I think the more person do what they are mastered in the more they grow. Specially, people like my who have been teaching for this whole life is even grow as new generation comes in. In fact ,even a busness can only grow if the CEO of the company have mastered on that position and ready to learn more things about it. Besides this ,people grow every single day. However, Some people grow single day. because the more you study for the things you have mastered the more you grow. For example ,it like teaching a kids how to eat. it does matter how mastered you have be paient with kids, teach them everyday and more the you the kids the more grow to understand not only how to eat but so many thing they saw from you. we may mastered in one thing but it have so many things connected to it .that can help throght life without changing your the career ,job or whatever it may be. I like how some student take cosmetology, they take this for two year to have a certificate but that does mean the student all have mastered in it so that is it. you learn about it to take you a different levels. it laso teach them to skill not only on make up and hair but to be paient with costumers and their own friend too. moreover, people can grow throght new education about their woke. Sometimes, people grow through new ability about their work or what have mastered in. people normally change or grow when there is to learn about what they mastered in. I said this because many learn more grow when there is a new change in syetem of education, economics ,bussines. For example ,doctor grow more when they have to learn more about something have ever seen all done but in same field work. like how you get to study more when you take IB course but not just they bring new things to help do you work on time and stuff. In summary,I think that the qoute Emerson wrote was not right because how can someone mastered some that can not help them grow .people thing will help them grow in future .I think people who are hopping jobs to jobs or whatever they are doing is bad , because doent help you to grow .because you get enouch time them you swtiches.",5,6,6,6,5,5,1560,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
10,2150,B727B720430B,"To whom it may concerned: For me, Policy 1 is better, base from my own opinion. Because Policy 1 would be better from Policy 2. For students to avoid breaking the rules of their own school, Policy 1 would be the better choice. Because they can use their phones during their break, lunch periods and whenever they have a free time. In some cases, most students and parents prefer to have the Policy 1 so that whenever they have an emergency or an important thing to do so, they can easily contact each other, except for contacting each other inside their classes. As long as their phones are in silence or they wont be using it during their class time, Policy 1 is a good choice. And for me, Policy 1 is the best choice among all of the choices that the principle would have. For students, having Policy 1 could be nice. I think they would really appreciate it if they would be having that policy. Because if in some reason, Policy 2 would be the one that the Principle will be choosing, theres a possibility that a lot of students will make a way to break the rule just to bring their gadgets, even though they might get into trouble. But, students must know their limitations whenever they use their phones or gadgets inside the campus. Students shouldnt be using it whenever the teacher is discussing or whenever theyre inside their classrooms. Because, instead of learning a lot of things from the school, they would just waste their time using those gadgets. I hope that you understand me why I chose Policy 1 rather than the other Policy which is the second choice. Because I know how it feels like when you dont have your phone by your side and didnt noticed that something emergency from your family is happening.

Its better to foward then moving backwords to put postive thought head and keep moving ahead. I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to success, it help in many way when talk to someone or when talk to costumer. Having a positive attitude help when working in a work place For example, when a costumer is giving a hard time instead reflecting back it better to respond with a positive attitude then a bad one. Then matter will turn out better. when reflecting back with a negative attitude the outcome isnt great it worst it better to smile then be mad. Its important to have positive attitude because there better outcomes having a better attitude is a big key to success it help when dealing a bad situation. Having a positive attitude change the way you see thing there much better outcome like seeing a smile on someone face because the attitude you gave them was positive and not negative. The action we do reflect on what is said or done, just like attitude reflect back. when giving the right attitude everything is better and there no bad responds or action done. The important of attitude is the emotion some gives when thing change for example, when a job gives a raise to someone the person attitude change because there happy. Small things changes a person attitude and a way of thinking. when thinking about the way your attitude can change in just a split second by the action taking place is pretty amazing how not only when someone is happy the attitude they show is better then it was before. In conclusion having a postive attitude is very important when to talking to someone. It is big part of life and it will help you with succes when facing a problem in the long run. the important of attitde is the way to think or feel and what makes you happy.

12,1907,13A94BBE2B24,"Imagine every time you look at the clock, it is time to dismissal, but you are still in school and doing tones of extra work. This is usually the time that you are in your sports practice or music lesson, or even relax at home and watching TV. However, things are different now. you lost the option to go home after the normal school time, because the school is extending the school day hours. It is not fair for the student to force them to stay any longer than the regular school time, it can simply miss up the whole plain of students after school activities. The school should not extending the school hours, because student might have activities and practice after school, and it is the right for students to choose to stay in school when the school is ended. For example, I have a lot of after school activities, and I always schedule them by looking at the time where school ends. I usually have music lesson right after school, it will be not convenient for me If the school hours are extended. I have to reschedule them, and decides with my private teacher. I might not have the time for the class because my private teacher and I are both very busy. The extending of school hours have the possibility to make me not taking the music lessons,because the conflict of the time. It is absolutely not worth it because , none of the new stuff will be taught in the extended hours, and we will most likely have more homework than usual. If we have more homework and more hours at school, our grade will most likely decrease because since many activities are squeezed to a short chunk of time, we will have less time to do our homework. In addition, It should be optional for students to stay on after school sections. However, there are people who have very few after school activities, and they are welling to stay in school. That is why school have after school sections. Instead of extending normal school time, we should let students to go on after school sections because it is better for the student to manage their own time and it is more beneficial for them. Students can stay in school for two hours every day in the week after the normal school time. There are many options for students to choose. Students can choose to study with a teacher in certain subject or work in the library if they want to study. Students can also go to the gym and play sports or even join a club like drama. Any options that students choose is benefit for them because they are learning in different kinds of way which might be more helpful than their regular class. It is clear that when students have trubble or issue in a subject, it is better for them when they come to the teacher one on one after school, because it is easier for them to understand the problem and it is easier for the teacher to only explain to one person. Over all, it is a bad diction to extending the school time. It will not help or benefit the students and it is a wast of time for the students. It more better for student that they go to their practice and after school activities or go to any after school sections. The student will be more beneficial and more welling to learn than go to their regular class for an extra one and a half hour.

First getting more than one advice from someone helps them make a better decision because they know what advice they need and what they dont need. Second receiving advice from more than one can make you combine all of the advices together to make one big advice. While getting advice from one person is great, Receiving advice from more than one person is beneficial. Getting advice from more than one person is more profitable than getting it from only one person. Getting advice from more than one person can help you really think about the advices people gave and you can benefit from the ones you understand. When you get the advices from those people they want you keep it so you can use it in future. You can get advice from anyone but you have to understand the advice that will benefit you. When you receive multiple advices you can combine all their advices to get one big advice that summarizes all the advices you were given. When you get advice from someone it connects to things such as, School, Sports, Jobs,and many more. When you get advice its to motivate your self to do more. When you get advice from more than one person its usually something your good at. When those people talk about the same advice you have heard before it all connects together to make a big advice. The big advice you get from all the people that gave you advices is to either improve or be successful. I think getting advice from multiple people can help you make a great decision.

16,3698,1202062A4FA5,"Just like some businesses schools should adopted a four day school week with each day consisting of ten hours by making the school day two hours longer. To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adapted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours. Should this school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? After considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week. Some believe that changing the school week to only four days is a bad idea because less school days means most work is not done and students will have extra time they dont need. Other people think a four day school week is an effective way of conserving students energy while keeping the same passe. People are still arguing about this issue. Schools should adopted a four day work week because students will be productive, It is healthy especially for students that work and have time for family and friends. Four days of school week help students to be productive. To be productive you need two things energy and motivation. Most students have the motivation to work but they lake the energy therefor they need four day school week. By extending the school day two hours we can achieve the same amount of work by working only four days. For example one school day is consists of for classes and one class is one hour and forty five minuet long. When we extend the school day two hours long for four days it covers the same time. That helps us to use own time efficiently and increase productivity in the school. Learning four days week also help students to be healthy specially for those who work on the regular days or weekends. People need enough amount of energy to get through the day without fatigue. The only natural and healthy way of get ride of fatigue is sleep. Many scientific studies says ""Kids and Teenagers need at list 9 hours of sleep!"" having four day of school day a week gives students one extra day of rest. It makes a big different and very important for students health. The final reason we need a four day school week day is to give students time with there parents and friends. parents and students want to spent quality time together but they are not able to because some parents work on the weekends or the students work on weekends. Four days school week is the best solution to this problem. It gives students the attention that they need form there parents and spend some time with there friends. If we can change the old school system by this new and effective four day school week days It will be beneficial in many ways not just for students but for teachers and parents. Students will be productive, health and they will have more time to spent with there family and friends.",8,7,7,7,5,7,244,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
17,3377,AAD6A5CBDDB9,"The skill i have learned is playing fortnite, i started playing the game in 6th grade because some of my friends told me to play it and i was like ok i guess so then i downloaded the game. And i sent friend requests to my friends from school, when i playing with them i was the only one who just started. I would just keep dying because i didnt know how to play, so what we would do we would hide the whole game and wait to the vary end to try to win. Then as time went by they added creative and creative was your own world you can join and do whatever you want, you could buildfight your friends or make teams or even do free for all. And as time went by again i was getting better and told myself i want be really good at the game, so and i looked in youtube and it gave me so much information. I learned so much new things that i would practice in creative to try to learn them. I would mostly look in youtube on how to do retakes, retakes are ways to try to get above a person without getting shot at. It would be really helpful but then my skill as a player was not getting better, because the only thing i would practice is build the right stuff. I would not be good ar editing or aiming, because i would never practice it. It took time to stay above the meta i just needed to find the right balance for all 3 major componets in the game. Then people discovers new things like how to win fights and how to make smart moves and smart edits that can win you the game. what im just lacking as a player is making the smart dicisions, like when to rush a player and when to not but in my opinion there is always something to learn overall fortnite is one of my skills that took me time to learn.",6,7,8,8,8,6,2285,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
18,2038,4744A861D13F,"It has been said that first impression are impossible to change. Based on my experience, I totally disagree with this statement. Here is my reasons why I disagree first impression are impossible to change. First, When you get to know a person, you always have a first impression on them. It could be negative or positive; however, it could change over time. For example, when I met my best friend for the first time, I had a bad impression on him. I thought he was serious and boring but it turns out he was actually fun to be around with and joyful. Secondly, Its not the same knowing the person for the first time than knowing the person for a long period of time. For example, people dont have the confidence of showing their selves when they meet the person for the first time. Although they are cases that first impression stays the same; however, it could change depend on how the person treats them. In conclusion, first impression could always change based on how you act. You need to get to know the person more to be able to change thier first impression.

20,2430,043B9F48FDC2,"Should all the students have to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Or should it be an electives and they could be able to make their choice to take what they want. I believe that everyone have different opinion , interest, or things they want to do. They are able to make their on decision but i dont think that it has to be required to take a class that some people arent interested in. I am disagree with this prompt because those classes should an elective. In my opion i wouldnt take any of those classes and my reason why is because i am not going to enjoy or like the class because i am not interesting in it and theres not a required that i have to take any of those classes. I had a friend who didnt want to come to his art class. One day i asked him why dont you go to that class and he was like i dont like the class, i dont enjoy it at all and also i didnt choice it, they just put it in my schechule. i was like look you should go to the office and talk to them about it. Because you dont want to be there and also you dont even come to that class and after a few days and he went to talk to his consul about it. Less than a week he always be in his class and i was like its your own choice to make desicion but i resolve it be cause you helped me. But in other school i have one friend that he loves his art class and now hes taking it almost every year and he told me. Generic_Name you should take an art class because its really cool and you do a lot of art also i enjoy it and i really like the class but i dont know what do you like but in my perpective i would take an art class every year. I told him look i am not going to take a class that i dont like because id rather be in a class that i like and i would enjoy it and i want to do stuff that i like and it will be my choice if i enjoy or not a class. Because look theres a lot of option and you can make a decicion and he told me "" Yeah you right"" and by it i just tell them everybody have to make their own decion but also remember that every decion have a concecuense. I asked a lot of people what would you do if they put you in a classs that you dont want to be in it?. They told me i just going to talk in the ofice so they can change it and i would love to come to that class but i also have the right to say something about if i dont like or i do like something cause we have a right to speak up. We should be able to choice what we want to study we dont have to have a requiered to do things we could do things by our own. But there might be a thing that make people think we should have a required to take classes that we dont want but also they have to think about that we are teenager and we might have our future planed but if they dont know that they have to take some classes they dont even want to take then those type of things make people think thats why we have to take classes to prove ourself. Another things and it influence a lot that they make required to do things and students just dont want to they have to think how we feel about things and how we would react. We all know that sometimes we are not in a mood or we are in our feeling or we just dont feel the day at all and it can affect our decion and required because people who make the required they just dont care about how would you feel or anything they just chose what they want and they say what they think will be better for a lot of students but the thing they dont think about it how would react to thing like i said earlier every decion has a consecuense and it could be good or bad but we have to deal with it. Most of the students would like to have all classes how they want and when they cannot do something they want then theres when the things starting coming out. Becuase they dont like it their behavior chnage and everything in that class. So all studesnts should be able to have the right to change things and everything in their schedule but their consul should have the right to say no to things that are not important at all and they could say you are taking this class because of this reason and you cant do it. Of course they will say something but they are taking care of their future and things they would do in life by taking any of this three classes. It might be good thing or it could be a bad thing but we just have to lisent to our students. Everyone have a right to make their own desion about classes and others things but if theres a required we are not able to do anythig. Because we just have to respect the rules and do it without our opinion. If we are able to make a choice then our feeling and the way we would feel about classes it will be matter and we could make our decicion and we will like the thing we choose. But sometimes we just cannot make the decision and someone else would chose it for us so we just have to see the pro and con about the desicion we would make or the thing we would do without thinking. I think it shouldnt be a required to take this classes and it would be a elective class because some people wouldnt take this type of classes they are not going to enjoy it and go because they just dont like it at all and everyone have the desicion to speak up and make decision by our own.",6,6,6,6,6,7,50,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

What ever the situation is good or bad you still have to tell the truth because it is good for everyone and, yourselves. When your honest more people can trust you and, the more people that trust you the better of a person you are. However, when it comes to suicidal thoughts or someone isnt feeling good tell the truth to an adult even though your friend told you not to you did a great thing for your friend, you might have saved his life. You can always tell the truth because being honest is always helpful and, good because, you did a good thing. Being honest is needed everywhere because if everyone was a liar our country woudnt be good. Telling lies is not good for you its a bad habbit for you and, once you lie a couple times you will countinue to lie over and, over. Whatever its about lying is never the answer to solve problems it makes it worse. You loose trust, you dont get anything out of it, and you just seem like a bad person by lying. For example, say you stole something and it was your friends toy. You decided to take him when he left it there and, he asks you ""Have you seen my toy"", The best option is to give it back or tell him that you have it dont lie and take it. It doesnt matter how badly you want it its not yours. The boys mother bought him that and it wouldnt be nice to just take it from him.

22,3207,39F578D9212E,"An enjoyable place where you can go spend time outdoors is going to the beach because you get to do a lot of stuff. For example, you can get to spend time with your family and have fun with them or with your friends. You may be thinking that the beach is somewhere where you can go and come back that same day but what you dont know is that you can go to a hotel and enjoy the hotel and the pool. You can go eat anywhere you want there is a lot of options you can choice from. There is a lot of fun things you can do for example you can go to the haunted house, the carnival, and the art work they have so you can take pictures with your family or other members. The beach is a place where you can go to relax and get sun tan and go swimming. The reason why you should go to the beach is because you need to have some fun time and not be stress about a lot of things in your life and enjoy the times you have with your family and capture memories with them. One of the most importance part of going is to be able to not be bored at home and do nothing. The beach is a place where you can walk around and see things you havent seen and also taking pictures of where you have been. You can go to restaurants or you can bring food of your own. You could be able to meet new people you havent meet before. There is a lot of clubs at the beach you can go there and dance and have some drinks. You could go to the store and buy clothes,hats,sun glasses, and more. The second reason why you should go is because they have good hotels you can stay in and you would want to pick a hotel that is right next to the beach so you could see a good view of it. There are these bikes you could ride with your whole family and you would all be able to piddle on it or you could bring your own bike or any other stuff you might want to ride. The waves of the beach is cold but it is worth it because the waves are really big and can push you really hard but that depends if you could swim. You could also go to the pool that is in the hotel and be there if you dont want to go to the beach. Sometimes, people would want to be at the beach and stay at the hotel for like two weeks or more but I consider you being there for like about four weeks because you would be eligible to discover new things or see new things. The last reason would be go when its 4th of July because when they have fireworks at the beach it looks really pretty and nice. The beach is a place where people could get married or have a romantic time there and they enjoy doing that. There are people that do there shows there like to get money for doing stuff for living. I would want to actually live at the beach because I dont need to go from where I live to the beach because its really far away but anyways, at the beach there is a lot of great stuff there and nice people and I know for a fact that you should diffidently consider going and not over thinking it. In conclusion, I recommend you going because you are going to have a lot of fun especially with your friends and family and you would remember that in your spending time outdoors you had a good time.

Sometimes is not good to tell others what you want because some of them may not want good things for you to get or have, you want to not used too much you phone, you want to loose some weight, and you want to graduated from high school. Today in day many people used their phone a lot and sometimes they dont do things because they spend most of their time on their phones. For example, you get home from school and you have to do some homework, but you dont want to do it yet because you just got home from school, and you tell your self that you will relax for a few hours, and then you will start to do your homework. You ate dinner and everything you go to your room and one of your friends ask you if you want to play videos game? you tell your self I will play a little bit and then I will start to do my homework. Two hours pass by and you are still playing videos games. You tell your friend I must stop playing because I have to start doing my homework and your friend tells you dont go, we ask someone to give us copy, and you say yes, because you want to continue do keep playing. When you get to school you dont have any body to ask to give you copy. It was your choice to keep playing. That day you make a plant you put a timer and when that timer stop you will stop doing what you are doing. It work because when you time your self you can do more than one thing, you could also have more time to just play but the good thing is you have finish all you things. For new year resolution you say that you will loose some weight this year. Your family laugh at you because you had said that almost every year and you have not do it. Sometimes is good to just tell your self to do things and dont tell anyone because some people dont want others to get things because they want to get it first and if they dont get it. Those kind of people dont want others do get it also. If you want to loose weight just do it and dont tell any body because you dont know what others want for you. Its better to do things in secret because at the end you are the one you are doing it and no body is helping you. The things that you do are for you not for everyone. When you have your things you can tell to your closer people and some of them may be happy for you and some may not, but that doesnt have to worry you because you have already do your thing and they cant do nothing to take that away from you. Your family may see you that you say things but you dont do it. You have to show them that you can do things that you say. You may feel sad because of what people say and you just have that in your mint. That is why not good to tell everyone of what you want to do because they may be jealous and they dont want you to be in a very good shape. Just go and workout and when they see you again they will say wow you look different what did you did to look great; they will not see you as a lair because you show them that you can do things. It can take time to see the different but you are doing it. When you are in school you will have friends that are good for you and also those that are not. When you are in high school you want to pass all your classes so you can make your parents proud and they can be happy; but their will be some friends that will tell you to go out and have fun etc. In school their will be students that care about classes and their will be that they dont care. You want to be with those friends that help each other to have good grades. Their will be friends that dont like you and want to get you in some trouble, and they will want you to dont have good grade and be like them. You want to be with friends that support each other. Also you dont want to be that kind of person that say you have good grade and you dont have those good grades and you just are copying others and when its test time you dont know what to do because you didnt do the work by your self.

People may disagree with this because they have good people around them and that they help each other. They may say this because they havent go through things like; one of your friends dont like you and they dont want you to have the things you want. Sometimes is better to do things and dont tell everyone because you dont know what people really want for you or what they think of the things you want. In this world are people that they dont care what you, they will agreed with what you do and if you felt they always be with you, their is those that they dont want you and others to be happy. The best thing to do is just do things and when you have it tell to everyone that you want because when you already have it they can just talk bad things of you and you dont stay in front of them as a looser because you didnt they dont know how you did it. Us human been we always have the thing inside of us that always make us jealous for what others have. For example, If one of your friends have a news phone you will get a little bit jealous because you also want to have that phone. Every single person in this world has when through that.

26,283,1BA1FD29BF69,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. I agree that the first impressions are the ones that are impossible to change, because impressions from other person can make you feel proud for that person, and impressions from other people about you can just make you feel good and happy for what you are doing, for your hard work. Reason of why the first impressions are impossible to change, is when you find those negative and envy people, that does not want you to be successful in life, and when the time came at your favor and you start to begin success in life, there is when you start to see those good impressions from those negative and envy people, and that just can make you feel happy and proud for the hard work that you did, that is why is almost impossible to change those impressions, because not matter what you showed them you always looked forward, but still dont hate them, love them as God loves everyone in this world. No matter what give good impressions and show them, let them know that they are working hard, people who works hard deserve good impressions, make them feel proud for what they are doing, and also no matter what give good impressions, show people how hard worker, how positive, how respectful person you are, show them that you always look forward not matter what, so when other people talk bad stuffs about you, your ones does not going to believe or change those good impressions from you, because you already showed them that good impressions you keep with you...",5,6,6,6,6,7,363,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

I personally think that my talent is photographing, but photographing take skills as well. Taking pictures is relaxing, fun, and cool at the same time. Photographing is I guess not easy and hard because while taking pictures you have to find the right angle the your photo and as well you can just take your picture in your own way. How I developed photographing is by going out and looking at intense images. when I go out, I always think about if I should take some photos of whats there like: the River People, and maybe other Cities as well as Nature. While taking pictures, its really relaxing because you can feel the wind breeze on your face and you can release your stress. For me I think that its fun because you can take pictures whatever you want, I also think that taking pictures is cool because you can see how things looks like up close how it looks like on camera. How I use it is by releasing everything that is on my mind. I also use it for improving my skills as well. For me sometimes its a little bit hard because I need to find the right angle for the photo Im taking. My photograph skills arent that good, but I practice everyday so I could take better images. During my free time I go out and find some photographic things like: Insects, the Moon, and other objects, and take pictures of them. To conclude , in my opinion I think that photographing can be your talent and your skill as well because if you like looking at intense images then you can take an intense picture too, or you can take it just for fun. Besides, maybe you can try to see how your photograph skills are too. ",6,7,7,7,6,7,1191,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
28,540,C82037D6072F,"Befits For An Extra Hour of School 85% of students who study more can pass more test. I feel like some students could befits from an extra half an hour of school because it could help students learn more. Also some students struggle with some subjects so it could also befits some students who can not stay back. School should add an extra half of a hour to school because it could help students get more education, better job opportunity, and help students to be better prepared for test. First, students with more education could help students lead to success. Education is helpful because it is need in a lot of daily activities. Education is also super important because it is through out life. Also some students who want to get in a good collage but do not have the money for it if they have a good education they can get in for free but they have to have good grades. Some students might want to become a teacher but might not have the right education for that so that why education is important. Second, students could have better job opportunity. Some students would not like the job they get. Also students with good education could give students a job they want. Another thing a better job could make the students get more money from higher paying job and also some students could want to become a teacher. Students also do not have to worry about how much they are getting paid and what type of job they have. Some students could have a better job opportunity if they get an extra 30 minutes because they get more education are more likely to pass their test. Third, students will be better prepared for test. Some students struggle with a lot of test because they can not stay back. So I think an extra 30 minutes could help students get a little more education and it could help students learn more and be better prepared for test. An also passing test is important because it is one of the highest grade and if u fail them it could make your grade go down a lot. An some student may struggle and that could help student do more activities and maybe they can pass more. In conclusion, I think an extra 30 minutes could hep students get more education. It is also good for some student. It will also help students be better prepared and it could let them lead to success. So I feel like an extra 30 minutes is not that long so some student would also not mine. So it could benefits some student to make them more successful.",6,7,6,6,6,6,2718,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

A lesson i would teach to elementary students is about being active in life and why itss important to be active in life and its,doing sports or or a physical activity, eating healthy, and going to the gym. Doing a sport is very important, because you are getting the excercise you need and loosing weight. It is very important sports if your a child, because children are young and energetic, so it is good for them to run around. Kids dont have to do sports, they can just go ride a bike around the neighborhood, go for a daily jog, and go ride a skateboard. This could be there daily exercise or weekly excersie. Eating healthy is very important, because you wont have a high chance of getting diabetes or heart diesease. Kids should eat there vegtables too, because it wont make you gain alot of weight. In my opinion I think vegtables are better than fruits. Children need to stay away from sugar, salt, and greasy food, because if you consume those types of foods it causes high blood presure, which gives you headaches. This could benefit for the rest of their lives. KIds should go to the gym once in a while, because they can go on a tredmill for 10 minutes. Kids should lift dumbells also, becuase it gets them stronger, and they could lift them at any size. Box jumps are perfect for leg strength, and it helps you with your athlecticism and vertical. The gym is perfect for a exercise routine.

30,712,597D76A3BF40,"I would like to start of this topic with a important question that no human being really thinks about, ""How is technology impacting our health?"" That is one of the most important questions that we cant leave unanswered. The use of technology have rooted in our lives, from the moment we wake up till the moment we go to bed we have hundreds of interaction with various devices, software programs, and tools. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having any contact with others. People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to any other person. The limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. While one might think that the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive effects on peoples lives, others might think that the lack of human contact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives which most people agree with. When comparing two human beings, one human being that always uses technology to do everything, shop, check out books, play games, do homework, and even talk to friends or family members, that person is most likely going to get sick, be in a lot of pain, or even feel depressed sooner then the person that prefers not to use technology at all but instead of using technology they would rather go out to the store to buy a book, go out to the store to shop new clothes, and even instead of calling on the phone to check on a family member they would rather go out and see them in real life. The reason the person that uses technology more is more likely to get sick or be in pain sooner than the other one is because not only computers and devices encourage more sedentary behavior among users but they also frequently lead to poor posture, neck stain, back issues, and hearing loss. This sort of behavior can lead to chronic pain and discomfort that is hard and not really easy to treat. Now that we have explained and understood this topic a little bit better lets go back to the question that we asked at the beginning, in case some of you guys forgot the question, the question was ""How is technology impacting our health?"" If people really took the time to think about this question that we usually always leave unanswered we would have known that technology isnt impacting our health in any positive way, technology actually makes us stressed, makes our eye vision bad, gives us back pain, hearing loss, and a lot of other negative outcomes. Another reason why people might feel depressed when they use technology a lot, is because they dont really interact with people and dont have any friends since all they do is stay at home and do everything on their device. Its scientifically proved that every human being need at least one or more friends to talk to every time they feel down and dont feel really good about something. That is the reason why most of the people that use technology a lot, sometimes feel depressed and dont really like to interact with other people around them. In conclusion , technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others and the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had a negative effect on peoples life and if people dont learn how to control and manage their time and not use technology every chance they get, our next generation will be exactly the same as this one right now .The sad thing about the limitation of human contact due the use of technology is that there is no turning back at this point we are in a society where technological innovation and progression is the norm; It would take a minor miracle to reverse all this disaster. In order for all of this mess to get better, people need to start learning about how to balance their time even if theyre using technology, otherwise it is only going to get worse and many people will start feeling pain in their back, getting sick, feeling depressed due to the lack of interacting with people and due to the use of technology.

31,2299,FA55AEEF8F9C,"Alot of people use cell phones In classrooms which I think Its a good Idea. Cellphones are use for emergencies and educational purposes. In my opinion students sometimes are given alot of work, where they have to find Information on their textbooks, or dictionary that takes almost half of the class. when they can just look it up on their phone and take about 10 to 15 minutes. Another thing is to think about are that students sometimes forget their homeworks at home and is worth half of your grade. and by having their phones with them, they can called their parents and asked them to drop up their homework at school. cellphones should be allowed in classrooms, students would be less stressed about school. They wont have to worry about carrying a heavy textbook, when they can just do their work on their cellphones. which it means, more work done and less time wasted on going page to page looking for the right answers. Now lets talk about having a cell phone In classrooms In case of an emergnecy. One reason I believed they should allowed cellphones In classrooms because In case of a lockdown. If a student sees the person, but the police does not know how he looks like or has no idea where his at. the student can call 911 and give details of the suspect. In addition to my other reason, Students should be allowed to have their cellphone In case of an emergency call. what If something happens at home. For example, A students sibbling gets sick and doesnt stop crying until he sees one of his family. So the babysitter calls his parents, but his parents cant do anything because they cant leave work or theyll get fired. The parents would have to call the student, now the student have to leave school and take care of his sibbling. In conclusion, I see no reason why students shouldnt be allowed to use cellphones In classrooms. schools would be more easier and safetier. you may never know what could happen and a cellphone can be a huge impact. It can save someones life. so I think students should be allowed to have cellphones In classrooms. sometimes students read a whole book and they dont understand it so they stop doing their work. while you can use your phone and find all the things and learn instead of reading a whole book and find most of the things you were looking for but not learning at all.

People hurts someone feelings because they made something really bad even if a person tells them that they are doing wrong things, they keep doing it, because for them the decisions that they are making are great for them. One example, lets say, when we were young that we fall a lot time in love. we were wishing to have someone to advise us because we think if the decision that we are going to make is not going to hurt someone. We always think about what is going to happen if we do things that we know are not good choices. We need somebody to advise us about anything. Another example, when I was planing to leave my house with my boyfriend because I did not wanted to go to school. I get really mad. I did not think on anything. I just wanted to do it even if Mom gets a heart attack because she wants me be more educate and have a better future, so someone that I have not seen in my whole life get close to me and say "" You are too young, think about what life can brings you if you go to school, if you graduate from college that many wonderful thing you can have.

Clearly, All we do is because someone is making us better by telling that we do not always have to trust on ourselves.

39,2751,ECB127F00953,"I disagree, I think if you are honest all the time, you might say some mean things to a person, which might hurt their feelings. First, being honest is good, thats how you earn trust. However, keep some things to yourself if you think its not positive to say to another. Second, It might make the person feel bad if you do say something harsh to them. Lastly, A person might see you differently if youre honest constantly, Whether it was nice comment or a mean comment you said. Firstly, there isnt a lot of honesty when there needs to be at times. Sometimes you have to say whats right in order to not hurt someones feelings from what you said. For example, your friend and yourself have to be honest in some cases to earn each others trust for the other person to be honest in return. Secondly, not being honest might lead you to trouble, if they might have found out you lied to them later. They might give you respect if youre not lying to them and not saying malicious stuff about a person. Secondly, If you are honest ""all the time"" some people might see you ask a snitch from the way you are saying everything to a person. For example, a teacher comes up to you and asked you a question on what a person did you would have to be honest and say the truth. I also think that ""honesty"" and ""truth"" are a similar word because, you have to do both in order to be honest constantly. The truth is that honesty can get you into a very bad situation if you have to be completely honesty with a teacher. By the wrong person you talk to, you might accidentally start a riot. Lastly, you should be careful on how honest you are to people, because you dont know whether they are going through some stuff you are pointing out to them. Being truthful to someone and saying everything to them might make them upset on how you view stuff in the world also. Honesty is like an opinion that may cause someone that went through something upset them drastically. This is why I disagree that honesty is the best policy. From the situation you are in say respectful stuff towards the person. It might make you a better person if you are not saying negative things towards a person too.

40,2008,6586DF43A92D,"I agree with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill when he said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Because we are all failures, but we all succed in life, if we work hard. Success is not going to come to us as esay as pie "" we go to success"". To go to success we have to be failures in a consistent matter but we learn from being a failure, to fix our mistakes. Knowing that we want a better future and that we want to be successful in many things such as in school, work, sports and many other things we have in life ,that we want to become successful gives us enthusiasm eventhough if fail to do good at moments.

Being a failure is not bad, it makes us strong to keep trying more and more. To graduate from high school we all need to pass a certain amount of SOL. Sometimes we pass the SOL some times we dont,Thats what leads us to success because we are going from failure to failure but with enthuisasim ,since we keep trying and trying till we pass the SOL. Because we know that passing the SOL is leading us to success and that we have to work hard and go to success because its not going to come to us if we loss our enthusiasim to keep trying. Work can make us go from failure to failure ,but enthusiasim well take us to success. Being successful in work may be hard that it might make us feel down or even make us feel like giving up. But always working hard and with alot of enthusiasim will help us succeed and acomplish many things such as getting a higher payment and getting a better employment can be possible if we always work hard towards success and with enthusiasim. Keeping enthusiasim is good because it doesnt only helps you to be motivated to keep working hard towards your goal / Success, but it helps your peers as well since your transmitting them the good vibe and enthusiasim. Others well succed too since your transmitting the good vibe/ enthusiasim to them they will be inspired by you. Playing a sport is not easy. Alot of practice and dedication is required to because successful in a sport. Becoming successful in a sport will take you from being a failure and to a failure once again . But if you really want to succed in that specific sport that you like ,you will have to try and keep trying with enthusiasim. Trying with enthusiasim willl help you become successful in that sport that you like and that you have been practicing with your dedication and enthusiasim. Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying. Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed. Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.",6,6,7,6,6,4,1325,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

I think its a positive effect on peoeples lives. It can make there lives way more easier. Someone may not like going anywhere to check out books and shop so they prefer to order them online. Technology helps a lot of people in their lives, an example can be someone that doesnt wants to attend public school so they prefer taking online classes. Online classes are helpful for students because they may have jobs to go to and they dont have time to attend so they can take online courses. Not just students but also teachers, instead of grading papers they can grade them online if they want to. Technology helps a lot of students with school and teachers with grading and other stuff. Technology can help people lives in other ways, someone that doesnt like to go shopping can order them through online without speaking to anybody. Maybe they dont have time to go to the store and dont have transportation to get there. Technology can not just help you to order stuff but it can help you find an item that you dont know where it is without speaking to another person. There are many stores that you can check out by yourselves instead of waiting in line for another person that can ring you up. Technology helps a lot of peoples lives in shopping. So yes, I think technology has a positive effect on peoples lives. It helps them in a lot of ways. Not just ordering stuff online but also physically.

As a matter of fact, the day I heard about the oportunities our school were giving to some students to be able to visit some companies. I absolutely want it participate, Because I want to develope more practice and skills about the job I would want to have when I get out of Collage . Farther more, Im very interest to work for a Microsoft company that has being my dreams sinse the day I started using computers and I would want it create something that can help others and create new technology for future Generations. However in my school theres not a lot of programs or clases about computer management or software programing, that could help me and other students to improve our nolage about computer Software. I would want to learn more and get more experience about crearting and fixing computers. For sure woking at a Microsoft company is what I want to do for a living. Also allowing me to come and visit one of the companies would help me undertand what Im going to be facing in the future when I start working for a big company For example, what is exactly the job Im going to be doing or what job I be able do enjoy doing , or what is going to take to get there etc. If you allow me this oportunity I can show you my skills and you can see and judge me by my job or what I can do. I belive I can be caplabe to do very creative work and come up with ideas in a matter of seconds to improve new producs. And this oportunity can help me figure out what other type of work i can be able to do. I appreciate the oppotunities your companies are giving to our school and other schools in general, but now I would want to know if you could give me chace and the privilege to come to one of your companies and learn more about Microsoft Programing and computers.

Another one is when your parents get into a fight that makes your kids in a worry thinking that there might be a separation beetween them.5. some people are worry while taking a test worrying that they might fail the test.6. Another example is getting bad grades similar to failing.7. And more getting bullied and no one even stands up for them thats a depressed attitude and might decides to kil them self.8. More attitude is acting cool in a class and behaving not well enough and even cussing at a teachers.9.

47,3140,A0BC5780C987,"Going outside can provide fun and enjoyable things to do for example going to the park with friend or people that you enjoy being around with, playing a sport, riding a bike, riding a scooter, and lastly a way you can spend time outside if you dont want to be so active is just walking around the neighborhood either with yourself or with a friend. Going to the park with friends or people you like surrounding yourself with is fun and enjoyable because you guys can make up a game or play a game and play in different teams and see which team wins first. Playing with some of the park equipment is another way to have fun for example the swings to see who can go the farthest upwards, the slide maybe you guys can time yourself to see who goes down the slide the fastest, or the monkey bars to see who can get across the set of bars quicker or who can hold themselves on the bars the longest. A little of a made up game my sister and I played when we were younger was obstacle course so what I would do is tell my sister that the floor was an ocean filled with hungry sharks and that would make the game more intense because at the time we were very scared of sharks and so if one of us fell of the monkey bars or rope the other would have to start chasing the person who fell until the person who fell gets to their ""safe spot"" which the safe spot would have to be far. Another thing you can do outside is play a sport, ride a bike or ride a scooter. Playing volleyball, soccer and basketball are my favorite sports not only because its fun but its very competitive and that always gives me so much energy and having energy just makes the game better because it makes both the competitors competitive since the boost of energy makes them tensed and careful to make sure they dont mess up so they watch the competitor like a hawk. If playing a sport is boring and not interesting to someone, riding a bike or a scooter is an option. Riding them is exciting and fun. Riding a bike or a scooter around a park is relaxing if your just calmly passing through but if your racing with someone or yourself then its fun so both ways is enjoyable to a person. If I go out to bike or scooter Im with either a friend or a family member because we like to bike or scooter next to each other and just talk or race to see whos faster and better at doing biking or riding a scooter. If going to the park or playing a sport doesnt interest you and you just rather do something calming and relaxing then going on a walk, run or laying outside with a blanket on the ground and watching the clouds go by is an option for you. If youre with someone and you guys want to run then you guys can calmly jog next to each other or have a small conversation while running or run and just be next to each other for support and comfort. If youre walking just with yourself then you can breathe, think, or just look at your surrounding look at the trees, houses if theyre any near by, or the flowers. Laying out a blanket on the ground and staring at the sky is enjoyable to some people because watching the sky and how the clouds move is angelic and peaceful to them, so if youre wanting to do something that includes being outside and you dont want to do anything then walking, running. and sky watching is for you. Laying out a blanket and watching the clouds go by is probably one of my favorite things to do just because its very relaxing to me, distracts my busy mind, and I find clouds beautiful so watching something that gives me peace to me makes me happy mentally and physically. Going to the park, playing a sport, going on a walk, or a run is some of the things you can do outside and enjoy and have fun. Being outside is important because Vitamin D if its low then a way you can raise it up is going outside because the sun is apart of vitamin D so not only going out is good for you physically but it can also be good for you mentally. Fresh air were use to being home all day and going out to get some fresh air willl cleanse you.",6,7,9,6,8,7,2153,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

The present letter is to let you now that Im fascinating of your business management, and Ill be glad to visit it. As you probably know many students are compelling to participate, indagate, and discover about distintic occupations in the work place. I think that it will be the most exiting thing that I could do because probably I can find an appropiated place of my interest to work at. In fact, I can learn about the resposability and most of the times the presure that some workers have. The importance of follow the rules, every little thing in the work place it could be important for me in the future. To adapt in differents positions and the most imporatnt thing is to love what I would do, to be an applicated, and apassionated person in the place that I would like. Nevertheless, many people hate their work because they never had the chance to visit many different places that they wanted, couldnt achive their goal or may be the postion that they wanted was alredy taken by someone else. The resposability at work has to be the most important, if a worker doesnt have the resposability in their job it will be a big problem, they might not care about the job and the things that their boss asked for. I would like to be the person who has the responsability and all the interest of my job, and be proud of myself by doing the right things. Althought, I can learn day by day how to impprove without an advice of the manager and be the best worker in my area. Many people think that work is only to get money, and bored and they are there just because they need to pay their bills, the main reason of work is to love what you like and enjoy doing it.

49,2907,B7075CD10BCC,"In my opinion the attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is a excellent idea for everybody. We have many benefit from to being able to attend classes from home for example, we have more time for sleep and have more energy for study, also the students has more dedication, the students has more concentration for study in home because, nobody distract to the student, the students have more time for make other things like work or others pastime Many student dont like this idea because, they think the attend classes online is so difficult but I dont think so because we have help of all teachers. One reason very important is not mess around, because take the bus for me is lose time, maybe the classes online can start early and we have more information, more experience for the future, the thing more important is learned more, in my opinion the school is a little distraction for many students because they dont pay attention to classes, they go to other places when we need study more for the life. Another reason is beacuse is about the video conferencing this idea is great because we learned to communicate or socialite with the people in the video conferencing, I think because, some students are silent and this option help you. For many parents I thinks is a great idea because they have more control in home like they know when the student work in classes or not, maybe the parents wanna see the progress of the children. The idea is productive, is a new experience for the students and parents. Maybe This option for the students classes from home by way of online is in my opinion a great news because for some people stay in home and practice and study is more comfortable. Classes online is not difficult for the students because in the computer we have modules and information and others things can help you, and is more easy in video conferencing because we have always somebody who can help, we can talk with a teacher or somebody, so is a good idea and new experience. In my conclusion I support and for me is a good idea the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing because is a new experience and i like it the idea and is more comfortable stay in home is more peace, more concentration, is more time for study and more important is learned more things, new thing for the future because the place is not important you can study in others places but the important is study more and more.

Olympic people did not just sit at home and got an Olympic Golden medal for nothing, they worked hard to achieve their goals. Yes, you always have to do something to become the succeed person that you want to become, to reach and achieve your goals, and to stay active and social with others. In my native country of Generic_City people always work hard, to get money, feed their families, and also teach their kids how to succeed in school and other athletic stuff, with the bad community that we have in their. As well as here a lot of people study and work hard to succeed. For example, at Generic_school we have a cooking class, they always push us forward and try to teach us new methods how to cook and seasoning the food, that gives a huge opportunity for the students who want to do it for living in the future. Another reason, is that it will be twice as hard if you say I want to achieve this goal at the end of this semester, but you are not working to improve your self to achieve it. This is problem that everyone have, like on our swimming team I had a really difficult goal to achieve, I started to push my self to the limit and work as hard as everyone else just to achieve it. And at the end of the season I did achieve it, which was to get a time that under 35:00 seconds, I shock myself and made my coach proud of me be achieving it. Finally by working outside, or joining an athletic team, or vising an old friends its another really good way to staying active and social with others, and talking to other people is another great way to solve a lot of problems, specially when you are sad or having a bad time. Others may think that staying not active for a bit or at all is a good way, they think that because having a time alone with yourself kind of make you think what is happening around you, However, if you fill your time with friends and activities that you like to do, you will not feel want to be alone because you will have a good friends all over you all the time, and they will help you to reach the goals that you want to achieve.",7,6,7,6,6,6,91,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Others persons dont success because they dont want to success, they dont want to be a impotant person, with a perfect job, or house. Success sometimes have something bad; to get success, in jobs, or in life, people go throw a lot of bad things. I agree with Churchills statement, its a true statement, and so important too. First, people have to have enthusiasm, if people lose enthusiasm they breakdown, they deteriorate. Failure make some people more weak, and others so hard in thinking in perfect things for there life. Failure is something that every person have, or they go throw failure before. People can failure in jobs, people get fire from there jobs they failure. Second, failure plays a amazing role in the pursuit of be better; However, when people failure to much, the perfects things come after. In peolpe life something chance when they go throw to much failure. They think different way, they see the thinks differents. When people failure, they start thinking in different way, because they go from failure to failure. People maybe think that they are not going to be a respect, or a important person, thats why they think like that. However, some people failure a lot of time, but they dont care they try again, and if they failure they try again, they dont stop trying they dont loss enthusiasm. Example: A person go to a school, to find a job like a teacher, he want to be a english teacher, they went to the main office to talk with the principal. She said, "" We dont need a english teacher in this school, we already have one, and he is so amazing in his job."" The teacher went to the other school to find job. He went in, and talk with the principal, she was so nice, and she accepted him in the school as a english teacher. He was so nervous, and so happy to hear what the principal said. He did not loss enthusiasm, the first school he went they tell him that they already have a english teacher, and they dont need another one. The second school accepted him, and now he is a english teacher, because he didnt loss enthusiasm. He failure in the first school, but he success in the other one he went. Last, Some persons are amazing to failure, but others are angry, or sad to failure, there is different types of persons. Some they like to failure, some they dont like to failure. All the persons failure in one time in their life, but they maybe success when they failure. Some success and they dont failure anytime. Enthusiasm is something important that any person have not to loss it. Success is something in your life, but people go throw a lot to get success, they failure and failure, and than get success. Some people dont success, because they dont want or they cant. Once people success, others are going to success too. A person success everyone success. People have to not loss enthusiasm to success. Some people success and dont have failure? Some persons success with not having failure, but later in life failure comes.

Bill Gate told friends about working with him, Bill Gate said: We could be create something new about software and computer. After two years, they could be create the new computer and software. Five years later, Bill Gate become rich people in the world. If Bill Gate did not told friends working with him, than we never know about software and computer like him created that. Bill Gate said: If the war appears, you did not working together, your country will be lost. Why we necessary to working with a group? Because working with a group might be make your love each other and understand when you work. When a group understand each other, they would be do some project better and always will be on time. Like a company they never have one people working in there, because one people could not be do some project better a group. Every people working in company, they never working with alone, because they dont know where you fail when you writing essay. Thats why we need a group can fix your fail and make you do better in your job. When you working with a group, you can learning some ideas your friends talking and the way they working. Danial Williams Hale said: Everything you learn, everything you practice, its would be help you some case. If you like working with a group, you can learning skill about your friends, you will be easy to successful on the goals. Like playing games, they need a team working together, if one people in a team like working alone, they can make your team loser. If you like working with a group, you will be have more friends and second language if your friends from another country. If in the world, we dont working together, maybe the world war three will be occur and the peaceful never got in the world. And we will never know culture of another country. In general, working a group can make students learning about how to work together and give an ideas best. And can be understand more about the life with people in group, can share problem and working better. If you teaching for your son or daughter working together, when they grow up, they can brainstorm better and faster. However, If they knew how to working with a group, they can create one company and system. They will leader a company grow up and never go down.",6,6,6,5,4,5,722,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
55,1918,E0553AEE109E,"Most students enjoy having a long summer vacation, but others prefer it not to be so long. Schools usually do three months for a summer break, but people argue that there should only be a month of summer break. Also have a longer winter break and a week off in the spring and fall. I do not think this is a good idea. Even though, when it is time to come back to school students will have forgotten everything, it is nice to have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and reduces stress for students. Educators should have a long summer break because people go on vacation a lot to see long distance relatives, or to just spend some quality time with family and have fun. For example, if you live in Virginia it will be a long car ride to make it to Florida or any other place. You will need a long break to plan your trip and have enough time to stay at any place you will go. Other people do not necesarily go on trips to just see family maybe it is a gift or a tradition that families have. Having time is the most important thing when it comes to going on a vacation. Another reason why it is a necesity for students to have a long summer break is because most students will get to work full time and make more money of their own. Most parents like their child to learn how real life is and what struggles you have to got through to get the things you want. Being a teenager will make you want more things it is the age you will start to drive and experience new things. For example, you will get to the age of driving and you will ask your parents for a car. You will need to earn some money to help your parents out they might give you an estimate amount of how much they can give you, but if that is not enough for you then you need to find a job to get to where you want to be at. If you have a part time job you will eventually get to where you want to be, but it will take longer that is why having a full time job will be easier to get there. To have a full time job it means summer break needs to be longer. Finally, my last reason why summer should be long for students is because it reduces stress for students. Being in school all year is hard for most students because sometimes is not just school what you have to deal with it can be things going on at home. Having to deal with both is difficult, so it is nice to have a long summer break to get a break from things. For example, if you keep failing tests it might be because you can not manage to study at home. After failing tests, having bad grades, your parents yelling at you for it, pressuring you to do better, and having other things to deal with that will make you have stress. It is important for students to be able to have a long summer break so they can get their minds off in a lot things and have less stress. Overall, having a long summer break means people will run out of things to do there should still be a long break because people go on vacations a lot, students can have an opportunity to work full time, and it reduces stress for students. A long summer break means more fun and less stress. Most schools have three months of a break and people are used to having a three month long summer break, so there will be a lot of arguments into why change it now. It is best to just keep it the way it has always been. Having long summer breaks also results in a lot of solutions for people.

58,1959,750184492A96,"Do you want to be board going extra hours to school, when you could be doing fun things? All the sports that you want to do will be ruined if you do homework club. Students should not have after school homework club because you wont have time to spent with family members, students are not going to have time to play there favorite sports, and they wont be able to play their favorite sport. First of all, students wont spend time with their family. If youre in after school club and your parents are planning to go eat dinner, you are not going to make it. For example, Generic_Name is at school and the day is over but, he needs to go to after school club. Generic_Name call his mother and told her "" Mom i need to stay after school today"" but, his mother told him ""we were going to your favorite restaurant Red Lobster."" Generic_Name upset that we wont be able to go to his favorite restaurant because of after school club. This proves that after school can affect on family time. Generic_Name missed his favorite restaurant just because school. Secondly, students wont be able to play sports. If you are in after school club and in a sport your most likely going to be late for your favorite sport. For example, Generic_Name plays Basketball but he goes to an after school club for English class. On Wednesday Generic_Name needs to go to the after school club, also he has Basketball practice after the club. Generic_Name goes to practice and he is five minutes late the coach tells him that is strike one. PROPER_NAME tried to convince the coach that he was at a club for school, the coach told Generic_Name """"Is either school or Basketball Generic_Name."" Generic_Name got kicked form the team because he got to strike three. This proves that after school club can affect the sport that you play. Generic_Name got kicked from the sport that he loved, and the sport that he though that was going to be his career. Finally, if you like video games their is only video games on the weekend if take this club. You are going to come late from school which means that you are not going to be able to play. For example, Generic_Name is a gamer on YouTube he streams every day and plays games for YouTube, but now that he has to go to after school club he cant stream on week days because he gets out of school at 6:30 and the drive home is 30 minutes. So, Generic_Name gets home at 7:00 and he needs to do some of the home work that he didnt got to do on the club and is to late for him. Also, Generic_Name just bought a game and he can only play on the weekends. He lost lots of people that were following him on YouTube just because homework club. Generic_Name was playing for YouTube and had a lot of people on his stream and lost half of them because after school club. After school homework club is a waste of time, if you have things to do after school. Its difficult to do two things at once so dont do after school club. If you like doing sports do it because you should do homework at your own time. If you do after school homework club in school for more hours. Dont do after school homework club if you dont want extra time in school. ",6,5,5,6,5,7,1521,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
59,3446,B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone youre not. You wont have to meet some jobs perspectives. You wont have to be someone youre not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life. The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some jobs ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they dont like the response. But, there are some jobs that will accept you and will like who you are truly. Second of all dont have to be someone youre not. You shouldnt have to please others only because they dont like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isnt. You shouldnt have to be the opposite of who you are just so you dont get judged on. Pay no attention to those who dont accept you for being nothing but yourself, and dont change for them unless youre doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what. Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you cant even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world wants them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more. In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you wont meet jobs perspectives, be someone youre not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where.

60,3034,9613CEAFE86E,""" Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? In my opinion i think we as people accomplish a lot if we are always doing something. One reason is because in oder to do something or succeed in something you have to be doing something for that to happen. I feel like if people want something to get done you have make a change and stay determined just like what Thomas Jefferson said in his quote and thats very important to keep in mind when you are trying to achieve something and you wanna make a difference. In Thomas Jeffersons quote he says something that really makes you think about how in society today how people deal with some things. It makes you wonder if people are doing the most they can to accomplish something and it also makes you think to yourself if you as your own person are doing whatever is it you can to accomplish your goals in life. I feel like some people dont do anything to try to accomplish the set goals they have for themselves and they expect for that goal that they are waiting for to come to them instead of them working for that accomplishment. It shouldnt be that way but some people think life is like that also when there is a major issue going on in the world some people think that doing nothing is okay. When people witness a problem some people decide not to do anything and the issue will go away when maybe thats not the case in some situations. There are people that are dedicated to what they want and will always do something to accomplish or achieve whatever it is they need to achieve and i think that is really good because it just shows that you are determined to do whatever you can to get what you want in life. People that are very determined achieve so much that it inspires others and makes them feel like they need to do something so they can start achieving want they want in life. I feel like thats very important because if you dont do something to accomplish what you want then nothing is going to happen in your life and I know there are people that dont do anything and they have nothing good going for them. I feel like Thomas Jefferson was the type of person to stay determined and focused on the goals he wanted to make. He set goals and he made them happen he made things happen for our country and all that happend because he was determined and focused and he wanted to do something so he can accomplish what he wanted. Everything in life you have to work for it and do something about it. It doesnt just land in your lap everything you do requires you to work for it and the end result will be that you accomplished everything you worked hard for. For example I feel like a lot of issues in this world could be solved if people would do something people wouldnt be running for there lives because there is a war going on in there country if somebody would do something about it. There wouldnt be so much negativity and so much hatred if somebody would just make a change. My over all conclusion about this quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote is that it is important for people to actually do something and work hard and achieve there goal. When you put your all into something your hard work pays off and you finally accomplished something and thats all that matters. I feel like what message Thomas Jefferson is trying to give is that life is always gonna be hard no matter what but you always have to push yourself and accomplish what needs to be done. When you do that good things come in return and it does serve purpose in you life it always have and always will. I think that is what Thomas Jefferson is trying to say in his motivating quote and it really inspired me and i hope it inspires others as well.

The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences. Many people around the world have different character traits, Everyone is different on the way they behave around others. Therefore they are formed. My character traits are quiet, funny, and calm.

But if I was to pick one I would choose to work with a group because of how many advantages their are, if your stuck and you need help you can always ask for help from your group because theres more than one, working with your group is easier than working alone because you can do different parts at the same time meanwhile when you work alone it takes longer, it becomes more difficult if you need help and not knowing what to do.

United States is consider the country were more fast food is distributed and consumed, and also where more people die because of their high cholesterol. Now a days with all the technologies advantages people is doing less exercise and moving less , for example: We use the car to go everywhere so we walk less ; we do not even need to walk to talk to a person , we can just send them a text ; even to see the weather outside we do not need to stand up ,we can just check the weather in our phone; we have got to a point where if we are to lazy to go to the cinema we can just stay home and watch Netflix,Hulu, Disney or any phone app. All this is great but at the same time is making lazy people more lazy and more fat , witch is causing more medical problems; like hart attacks , high cholesterol. In a future if we do not change anything this it will get worse. A way of helping the future kids like the students from this school would be by teaching them that there is more than fast food , that there is also healthy food that can taste awesome and some even better than the unhealthy food, for example: avocado, fruit juice ,Cesar salad, fish,etc. That all this types of food can create a balance between eating what your body need to work correctly , and what it want to eat. One way of showing them other variety of food , is by the school menu. The menu could contain food that the kids have never taste before , and that could have less fat than a pizza. This way when they get older they will not only look for , hamburgers , Chinese food or chicken wings. They will know there are more options that could help them with their body. And if we do not teach them this habit right now it will be a lot more hard to get them in the healthy habit in the future.

Some choose to be bad because they think if they choose to be a good person people will take advantage of them since good people always the ones who cares so much , help others all the time , and think about people happiness before theirs.

A test can be enjoyable because you can proof that you smarter than other people by getting a high score and thats fun and proof the people that they were wrong about you. Life is enjoyable because you have a lot of memories that happen since you were born until whatever age you are now but time is relative so dont stop having fun in life. Enjoyment can come from many things like getting a goal in a game, a hundred in a test, accomplishing something for the first time but there are many things that can bring joy in life. As you get older you learn new things, you get wiser but also you have more befits and disadvantages. For example, adults and older people have money and with money you can get things and spent it in anything you want and plus yall can drive and go places and thats what people enjoy too. A huge disadvantage for adults is that they have to work for 8 or more hours but either way imagination never gets old but instead it gets newer. Adults and kids or teens however yall want to call us but we are the same the only difference that we are younger but we all have a imagination awake or hibernating and thats what allows joy in peoples life even for the people that barely have it awake. Everyone needs to live life at its fullest being joyful trying new things like sports, music, or even puzzles but time is relative you stopping yourself because you think your getting old but thats not the case do everything you want to do before time runs out for you and youll leave with regret but everyone need to wake up there inner kid inside of them and start living life without regrets try new things, talk to new people, spend more time with your parter or family etc. but make new memeries and be jolly and have such enjoyable life to new things youll try.",7,6,7,7,7,6,3467,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
71,288,6531927DF837,"The mind can perform differently when extensively staring into a phone screen and causes a lot of distractions in the classroom setting depending on how its used. As for educational purposes, using a cellphone to probably schedule some test dates, or save notes for later use can really improve keeping track of class subjects and assignments, considering most individuals carry their cellular devices on them every time of the day. We also have notifications on our devices to notify us on when weve missed an important assignment or other things. The real issue is whether the students are actually taking advantage of its dependability to actually improve their classroom performance. The human brain can be effected on how long you use the phone regardless of where you are, and that issue goes across all devices. When having used your phone maybe in the middle of the night before a major test, your sleep is cut by maybe an hour due to the eyes being exposed to blue light shifts, which is the brightness of the phone seeping into your eyes, so it is very critical on how the person uses the device before, during, and after school. Now another big issue is having the freedom and functionality to use the phone however youd like. This is where a teenagers habit of text, calling, or sending pictures, brings up the debate of using cellphones for educational purposes. It is very easy to get distracted by other uses of the phone while also very easy to take answers from maybe a friend or find cheat sheets online. We dont have the right to control how people use their phone and thats where my opinion on it leans towards restriction policies and or, giving full responsibility to the teacher about when they can use their phone. Our phones are also effectively useful for keeping a calendar and keeping us notified of the important things in life especially in the educational sense where paper and memory just dont suit us very well anymore in this day and age. Phones are evolving rapidly and manufacturers are finding new ways of making them more useful for work, school, and social media. Modern education now requires plenty of technology to keep us updated, and there will eventually be a day where education is fully integrated into computers and touch screen devices. I do agree we need some form of policy or agenda to make use of the phone to help our students with how theyre approaching their education. Teachers must have to conduct the convenience of the phone and whether a certain student can use it properly and educationally. It is a unique creation we have come to experience in our time, and I hope our generation can think heavily on this matter with a progressive and open mind. All it takes is serious debate and rationality for both sides of a subject matter to be comfortable and conclude with what helps us most while also advancing our students properly.",9,8,9,8,9,9,1319,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

76,432,68256AC96C72,"At a young age some students are determine to identify a career they want to do in the future by the time they enter high school. For example, their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career in life so they can be successful. Students should not commit to a career at a young age. Committing to a career at a young age can cause students to have stress. For instance, some students are being pressured by their parents into finding a career before they go to high school and that can lean them into having stress. The younger students in elementary school think they know what they already want to do for a career in the future, but once they get older and enter high school they start to change their minds about the career they choose as a kid. There are some students that have a strong concern or eagerness that they wont be able to find a career they like before they enter high school or graduate form high school. All of this can later lead to a state of mental, emotional strain, anxiety, or they start think they wont be successful in life. Students might not know what they still want to do in the future since theyre still young. For example, students have trouble trying to identify a career they want in life. Students shouldnt have to worry about what career they want since theyre still young and they can later end up to stress. They should also try to focus on being just kids; then once they start to get older they can start to think what kind of career they want to do later in life. In conclusion, i think students shouldnt commit to a career at a young age because of all the stress they might get they might not know what career they want in the future. While this may be true, others argue that students should commit to a career at a young age. This can later lead them into having a successful life if they start to study the careers the students want at a very young age. For instance, when students start to study a career they want, they can end up having a very successful job in their future.

In the past few years, there has been many teenagers that go to college and try to do a career that they think they are able to work with, but after few days of studying for that career,they see that thats not for them, and they just drop out. Our schools and our parents have been trying to help us decide what we really want to do in our future before we enter college, that way we dont do the same mistake some people did. Now schools have a program where you get to choose what career you think you are interested in, and see if its really what you want for your future. That way you have a chance to either stick with it or look for other career you could be interested in. I want to be able to see if the career I want to take its really for me or not. I think whatever career someone chooses, it shouldnt just be for the money, it should also be for some that makes you happy and that you are going to be able to stick with your whole life. My friend Generic_Name graduated in 2014, and he started to attend to Generic_school. He studied to be an architect, but the only reason he wanted to be an architect was because he wanted to help his family out with some money. Generic_Name was struggling to be an architect, because it was a lot of math, and he wasnt really good with numbers. What Generic_Name really liked to do was to fix cars with his older brother. He couldnt do it no more, he dropped out of college, and started working with what he knew was gonna make him happy. He worked for a whole year as a mechanic and saved money, that way he could have his own business and help his family out. He finally did it, he has his own business now and whenever theres a problem with my moms car or my dads car, we go to him. This is what Im talking about, he never had the chance to see how hard that career could be and if it was going to make him happy. I dont want to do the same mistake, I want to know what I will be getting into and see if that career really is for me. If you give me the chance to go,visit,and learn about the career Im interested in. It does not only help me to see if Its really for me or not but I will also learn new things I didnt know and those things, they could help me in life. I want to be doctor and to get there, you have to go through a lot. As right now, Im attending to a nurse class where I learn the basic things like knowing how to do blood pressure, learning body parts and learning a lot of vocabulary. I also know three languages: Spanish, English and Latin. After finishing my nursing class, I want to attend to Generic_school, because Ive heard their doctor and nursing class is the best. The only reason I want to be a doctor is to help people out and be able to keep them healthy without any problems. My dad wanted to me to be an electrician because thats what he is, but I told him that wasnt really my thing. He taught me all he knew, that way if i ever have a problem with that, I would know what to do. One time i went to a friends house, and it was already 9:00 pm. Out of nowhere, the lights of the all house went off. So what me and my friend did was, turn the flashlight on of our phones to be able to see. His parents were freaking out, because they knew it was late already and there probably wouldnt be any electrician that would pick up the phone. I told my friend that this i could fix this because my dad already taught me how to do it. I called my dad to make sure I was right, since hes the one that knows everything about it. I was able to fix it and turn the lights on again at my friends house. They thanked me and were surprised for knowing all this kind stuff already. Every career is important, it might not be the one for you but you will always learn new things that will help you in life, like it helped me. There might be people that say to just look for a job where you get paid well, or people that say a career is too much because you have to study a lot, so Ill just go and work as a waitress. Yes, it is important to try to get a job that pays you well, everyone likes to make money. But if you dont like the job you are doing everyday, then you wont ever be happy with what you are doing. Thats why you have to find a job thats really for you. You do have to study a lot to have a career, of course you have to. Because you are not only helping yourself, you are helping other people thats going to need your help. This is why its important to know what you really want for yourself. I am writing you this letter because i want to know what I am going to get into, I want to know if this career really is for me, because I want to make sure I stick with my decision.

If its not for me, then theres always another way, you can look for other career and see if you are interested in. I know theres more people that probably want the same chance as me, but I hope you choose me. Its not just because the money I want this chance but also because I want to help people out.

When she was on her way to the soldiers she decided to pretend to be a boy because she knew that if she shows her self as a girl the general will send her back to her fathers house .When she got there Generic_Name trained for the war ,she was so ready to fight. The general told them to get ready for the war so that when the enemies comes they start to shoot them first. But the other group planned a really bad way to finish them so when they got there they were all shoot by the enemies except for Generic_Name .She fought all the enemies and they were all died. but when she finished she was so tired so she felt down and slept. when she was asleep the fake hair dropped .When the soldiers came they were so happy but when they saw her they were surprise.``A girl shes a girl,"" one of the soldiers said. When the general came he was so angry that wanted to give the other soldiers permition to kill her but he remembered that she helped them won the the first war so he decided to let her go home and never come back.

The news was all over the place .The villagers were so afraid because they didnt have any one to protect them .Generic_Name dint want their general to die so she planned something .She went to the enemies secretly .She killed all of their enemies and then she went to their captain . ``Your highness I know the person who wanted to kill you,"" she said. ``He said that he is not afraid of you and he is waiting for you your highness,"" she said. ``Do you you know where that person is now?,"" Asked the captain. ``Yes and he said hes waiting for you ,""She said. ``Take me there,"" Said the captain.``OK ,"" She said. So she took the general out side. But when the general got there he didnt saw any body. ``Where is the person?,"" the general asked.``I am the person,"" Generic_Name said. At first the general laugh and laugh but when they started fighting .The general died and the people didnt have any problems. And from that day on Generic_Name was accepted to be a soldier and everybody respected her . One job that i would like to work to would be a soldier because i want to get a lot of money and I also want to help the citizen just like Generic_Name did.

If you have a question its difficult to ask to the computer unlike to ask to a teacher. Second i dont think students would be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. If they get lazy they can say they going to take the class later. if they want to watch a movie they going to forge thinks about the class. They can get distracted for anything like the phone,music,and the TV.Attend class from home would not benefit students if they want to hang out with their frinds they can leave the class in any moment unlike if they have a teacher giving the the class in the school they can respect the class,put more antention,and understand better the class. Third i dont think students would be benefit to attend class from home they can get confused with the class. if the take the class online they can read the direction but sometimes even reading the directions students get confused. is better to attends the classes in the school so a teacher can help students with anything students will need. teachers have the experience to explain students what they need to do about the class. attend classes online students basically are alone so is more confused to understand the class. in school if students get confused they can ask to someone else to understand. at home they dont have anybody so they have to think alot to understand. attend classes from home can affect students grades for less knowledge about the class unlike in the schools they have many opportunities to learn better. In conclusion students would not be benefit to attend classes from home they can get distracted for anything. It can be more difficult to them to undertand the classes. they can get confused with things about the class for not have a teacher with them personality to be helping them to undertand the class.",6,6,6,4,6,7,527,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

While other people might think that if you keep working hard, and there will be one day that you can get successful. Because you did not give up for this things, however this is a wrong way to thinking, the reason behind this is yes it is ture that if you are keep working and do not give up then you might be become a successful person but Its still depend on what kind of ways are you choice to go. if you choice a wrong way to go then you get a big mistake, you have to start all over again, thats wasting time. Other reasons that behind people think they should keep working are it can let people have the spirit about do not give up and have brave to try something. But people will get lost when they working to hard, they do not know what should to do, and if they failed about what they doing now, they will be worry about next time when they want to do something, they became afired to try.

88,3535,15B68B826F8D,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" He believe people should try to do something new beyond what they already know. Being good at new things can make you feel more confident with yourself. I agree that people should try to do something new beyond what they already mastered because trying to do something new can make you feel more confident and experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. To begin with, trying to do something new can make you feel more confident with yourself. People can be more success in life knowing more things. If people are always scared on doing something else they will not have experiences in life and It can be hard for them to grow. For Example, I was working in a restaurant for so long I really knew how to do that job, but I wanted another job to get more money; however, I was scared on getting a new job, I thought I was not going to be good in at that, then someone told me that I should try that I will never know if I am good at something if I do not try. Now, I working in a new job, I am more confident, and I am one of the best workers in the restaurant. Therefore, If people do not try to do something new because they do not feel like good at that, they will never know if they were one of the best. Growing is part of trying if you failed, then you will learn from your experience. Second, experimenting something new can make you discover more about yourself. Sometimes you have to let go what you already mastered and start experimenting more about life, so you can not be stack on the same thing. Grow is difficult for the people who do not have experiences in life. For instance, When I came to this country I was so scared on learning a new language and how people will treat me, but start interacting with new people, learning about their countries, and trying different foods. Now, I can say that I have learn so much from other people and I realized that interacting with other people can make me grow in a way that I can feel more confident when I am around people. So, experimenting something else can make people matured and smart as well. On the other hand, some people say that trying to do something beyond what you already mastered, do not make you grow. They say that people that are good at something should not be evolved in something else because they could get lost knowing different things, but I believe people will never get lost learning new things, learning is the key of growing. For Example, my friend is soccer player he is really good and he started learning to play baseball, he became good at both sports. That shows that people can be good at different things at the same time without lost what they already know. Therefore, trying something new can make you good at different things and discover talents that you did not know that you have. To conclude, trying to do something else beyond what you already mastered will make you grow. People can discover more about themselves, grow with the experiences on tying to do something, and if they failed they will learn from that. Life give us that opportunity to mastered different things, learning something new make us be more confident and success on life. We should try to do something else maybe we are not good at that, but at least we try to do it and get something with us. Life could be bored if you are stack doing what you already know and not trying something else.",8,6,7,7,6,7,294,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

94,230,ED0A8E614649,"Techonology has becoming powerful that let students and teachers to give and receive classes online. Disadvantages or adventages of taking classes online? These question are faced today by students deciding taking online classes. Often students work part or full time jobs while going to school or collage so their time is valuable. these students want to make the right decisions in choosing classes so knowing the disaventage and adventages is important. I believe that online classes is a good opportunity for students as it gives flexibility, they often offer any type of class desired and provide access to faculty, and they often offer accelerate courses. To begin with, one of the best adventage of online classes is flexibility. A student can usually take the course any time during the day or week. While there are custom essay writing and researching assigments to complete, the precise time to take the class often depends on the students desire. Students who work are able to take the class based on their schedule. Many students work on afternoon. The flexibility makes it possible for a person to complete the course, while attending school or collage courses in person might be imposible due to their work schedules. Secondly, another great adventage of online courses is that almost any type of course can be found online. Distance learning course are often avaliable from a number of collages. A person can simply use the google to find a class. While most people believe a disadventage of taking online courses is that the students can not have access to faculty a member, the fact is that many online courses offer a grater access to faculty. Shy students are able to ask questons and receive the answer back almost inmediately. Lastly, Online courses are convenient for most undergraduate and graduate students who can study when they want and they can finish writing or researching assigments based on their own person schedules. The fact is online classes offer flexibility and conveniece that are often vital to students who work and have families. In addition, many students are looking for classes that are advanced to complete the course faster. The best way to advance in the class is to make it online because in the regular schools it takes a long time as there are students who get behind and the teachers wait for them since everyone has to go at the same time. To conclude, with online classes, students do all the work at their own pace. As long as they meet their deadlines and participate apropriately online. Also, studying online requires more self motivation and time mangement skills because students will spend a lot of time on their own without someone physically close to keep them focused on deadlines. Online course will not only teach students geology or poetry, it will also help them become more self motivated, a trait that will make them stand out in the workplace and beyond. It will teach educators to be mature choosing right decisions as it will make them explore more and be students with an open mind.

I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school workers because they money they get payed will increase. 1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day. if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teachers use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teachers teaching everywhere they went and its very helpful, for an example they teachers was like your parents telling you to do something you dont wanna do they know is good for you but still you dont wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teachers was like back then in Generic_City, the more hours we had the more smarter we got . This evidence shows that the more time we got learning with our teachers the more smarter we got. clearly sometimes the teachers rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teachers get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject. 2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day. perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teachers because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hours was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like 1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to turn your work in its time to go innocent didnt have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done. after weeks innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teachers fault so he didnt blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all students and teachers. in addition for students to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class. clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect students grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush. In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student dont have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they cant and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didnt have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if students have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the students. if the school board add one hour and half the students grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

Attitude is very important, and the way you use it can really affect the success that your trying to reach and to others ,its also very easy to just lose it all in less than a heart beat.

How can positive attitude motivate you to do good? well ya see when your having that energy that makes you believe you can do anything, or that anything is possible thats motivation for you to keep trying and embracing that positively well make a person stand out. By doing that it makes a person feel good about themselfs and motivates us to keeping that same energy.

By motivating your self, and others themselves will be motivated which is a really good thing. Its like your helping others out one of the first things to do to become successful , to help each other out and having a lot of patients is all in that positive attuide. This plays many key roles in the real world and will make a huge difference as well. An example, walking in for an interview being positive at all costs and respectful shows signs that your interested therefore you would have a possibility of getting hired and can go from there you will be a very successful person. I know everyone is successful in there own ways but there are limits and attitude plays a huge role in that. spreading positively to others is another important topic because these people might not be doing so well but you can always help change that for a person. By boosting their confident to make them happy comes from positive attuide because in life, theres no time to be playing games theres very little time to accomplish your success before its over and soon to be regretted. Also in encouraging others will make you extremely happy that right there will get you somewhere in the future and it will be good. most jobs in this life style today sometimes go based of skills and etc. But Mostly look into a great positive attitude, there are a lot of benefits to this in reality being skillful and useful. When something doesnt go as planned, keep trying bring that positive attitude forward never give up its not too late to change. Taking a test and having it being extremely hard when given negative attuide you will fail and face the consequences but doing the opposite you would be much more relaxed,and will boost that confident up into keep trying because life is full of mistakes you have to push and keep trying now thats what being successful is almost about. Albert enstin did he give up? No right? and look at where hes at he became one of the most successful person ever same with Bill Gates and Mark Zurkrbuirg when you keep going you will see the results so keep pushing and one day I guarantee you will be a great role model or even better. Just remember always keep that positive attuide and keep trying think about the good and not bad and you will have the key to success. learning from your mistakes is another key attuide to have, people have to understand that when you learn its OK to fail and get back up from it thats why you learn from them for a reason. Having positive attitude in life helps you grow as person to understand, and in the long run it will important. When doing so, you will just keep growing,and having good support from yourself or others. think about businesses to be in a business its all about that positive attuide and character thats what makes you learn from your mistakes and to keep growing. In a business theres a lot of ups and downs with negative attuide it will only make it worst but when your in the right state of mind there are choices to make that you might not like but it is part of life,in a business you need to support one another.

105,178,2F93B934ED27,"Control Our Characters According to what the British naturalist and politician John Lubbock have been say, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" Our character formed by influences beyond our control. We should all choose to control our character because that will save us from trouble, trust our self, and have a lot of relationships with friends. First, we should all choose to control our character that will help to save many of us from trouble because being in trouble that very bad and many people will not talk or keep in touch with us or have any friends also. For example, Generic_Name always many students keep saying bad stuff to him to make him fight with them, but he never care about what they say he always go to tell the security about them. He dose not want to be in trouble, that make them very angry because they are in trouble not him. That makes Generic_Name safe, and out from trouble. We have to be strong enough always and find another way to control our character to be in safe said, not being strong by fight and be in trouble. Control our character will make us trust our self. Second, we should choose to control our character that will make us trust our self because when we control our character we will trust our self in everything. For example, Generic_Name works in the hospital hard to make everyone feel better, not sick one time one person was sick about to died, but she dose not cry because of that she control her character and she trust her self, So she give him a medicine and he dose not died he feel very well. Generic_Name never give up she always trust her self and she control her character with everything. We must control our character so we never give up and we can trust our self. In the other side, some people may argue that choose to control our character will make some people think that we are sick, scared, alone. Thats true because when we choose to control our self a lot many people will think that way. However, we choose to control our character because that will make everyone want to be with us we will have big relationship with everyone. For example, Generic_Name always control her character she also has big relationship with everyone many people want to be her friends they like how she control her character. People are very likely to people who have good character and to people control their character thats why we have to control our character. Lastly, We all should choose to control our character to be out from trouble, to trust and believe our self, and to have a lot of friends. The result from when we control our character always we will be away from any trouble. Also, when we control our character we will trust our self in all the stuff and in anything even if its hard. Therefore, many friends we will have while we control our character, friends do not like to have friends who is always angry dose not know what to do they like the friends who always control their character and who know everything. To control our character is not hard if we need a better life.",7,7,6,7,8,8,630,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
106,2428,9B5E878ED861,"Everyone would like to receive praise for their work, even if the work is not their best effort, that will make them not to think low of themselves and just give up. In my opinion, true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives an individual determination, and self confidence. Although, some people believe that self-esteem comes from an achievement because it gives self-discipline; for instance, a student did a poor job on a classroom test , that means he is not receiving any praise and didnt achieve anything, but because of that he will be self-discipline, so he would do a good job next time and receive an achievement. I think true self-esteem come from praise because it gives an individual determination. For example, if a student gets a non pleasant grade in class, and the teacher praises the student but also tell him to do better next time, that would give the student hope and determination to do better next time. In addition, true self-esteem comes from self-confidence. For instance, I am in a soccer club, but every time we practice I dont do better because I dont have the confidence, but instead of the coach cutting me off the team, he came up to me and told me that I can do better. He praised me and courage me to do better. That is going me to build self-confident in me and I would start doing better during practice. According to my reason and examples stated above, I think true self-esteem comes from praise because it gives a student determination and help build self-confidence in a student. To all the teachers, please praise a student work and let the student feel like the can do more and better.

107,1860,48F7FCAD8B23,"Will has you can see getting advice from others is not a bad idea. I think getting advice from others has a great point of view and a bad point of view by the way someone can look at. When you are trying to get advice from someone remember to ask more then one person for advice. One of my reasons is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. My other reason is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. My last reason is asking people for advice can hurt its not always going to make you happy. My first statement is that how ever is trying to get advice should get it form multiple people not just from one person. Most of the people in this world have different point of view for each person on the way they see them or maybe by the way they you act and look. Asking only one people is not a good idea because someone might just be looking at you how you look and how you dress. They might just say bad things to you because they thing your not worth nothing and they are the only ones that actually are worth something in this world. People in this time dont gave good advice to people because all they want to do is make people look bad in front of others. My second statement is that getting advice form people can have a good or bad point of view but it also can depends on how you take the advice. Will in my point of view asking people for advice is not a great idea because some people might just till you lies when you are asking for advice. Sometimes people just tell you lies because they know that you need help but all they are going to do is make you look bad. They are some people that all they want you is to suffer just because they are having problems at home. Getting advice form one person is not a good idea because you might not know if they hate you or that you might have done something that hurt them and you didnt know and you asked them for advice they would gave you bad advice just for what you did to them. My last statement is that asking people that you thing that will tell you the truth no matter if it hurts or not is not a bad idea. They are some people that would tell you the truth even if its going to hurt a lot but the only thing they want for you is too be happy. Asking people older then you is a great idea like your family because maybe they have been though a lot maybe they might even hate you or something else but they would never lie to you because you are there children they care about you. Getting advice is not bad it also can depend on the way you decide to take it if you take it as a good or bad way because most of the people that are always there in your bad a good moment always want the best thing for you because they love you. In conclusion, asking for advice sometimes and talking to others more advice can help you make good choice but at the same times bad choice it all depend on you if you want to be a great or bad person. Everyone has there point of view to take the advice that someone gives you in a good or bad way. Mostly the people that love you are going to tell you the truth even though if it hurt because they know that later or after you are going to find out the truth. In this world you should take most of the advice that other people gave you because they have already been thought a lot but they dont want you to through the same thing because they actually want you to be someone if life even if they couldnt be someone in life. The advice that someone gives you is not bad it to help you see how hard they work because they didnt take the advice that they gave you are they didnt get the chance like you have so if someone gives you a great advice you should be grateful.",6,6,7,6,4,4,954,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

110,2368,EA03135D3C88,"Student-designed Wouldn`t it be exciting for a student to create a summer projects for their fellow students to do during summer break? Summer break is a time for students to have fun with their families and friends. It a time to travel to so many places like Generic_City, Florida, California, and so forth. Furthermore, it`s great for students to complete summer projects during their break so their brains and memories can still be refreshed and for them not to forget most of the school materials they have learned before summer break. Moreover, requiring students to complete summer projects to assure they continue learning during their break is a brilliant idea. But these summer projects should be student-designed because the projects will be exciting, students will be more engaged with the projects, and the student-designed projects will definitely be less harder. The first reason the summer projects should be a student-designed is because the projects will be exciting and enjoyable for other students. For example, when a students designs a Kahoot for their fellow students to use to study for their test and quizzes, it will be exciting just because the students will get to choose any names they wish. So, a Kahoot is a game that teachers use to create a test or quizzes for students to study to get them prepared for their test and quizzes. The Kahoot can be used inside and outside of the school premises. The student designing the kahoot will get to choose how many seconds or minutes it should take the students to answer their questions. Also, most teachers don`t give students enough time for them to choose their answers and that is unfair. Students needs more time at least 20 to 30 seconds to think about the questions before answering and not rush to choose any answer just because the teacher didn`t give them enough time. Students complain about how much time teachers give them because they need more time to work on their projects. For instance, teachers design boring projects like making a word puzzel about math. That is so boring because no students wants to spend their time making a word puzzle about math instead of doing other fun things like reading, going to the movie theater, going on vacation, and spending time with their families and friends. Most of the students don`t find math interesting beccause they don`t like doing math. Another reason is that students will be more engaged with the projects. For instance, a student designed a project about each students choosing their own topic argumentative essay like increasing the minimum wage, the college tuition, and discrimination. After that, the student will design another projects about presentations. The presentation will teach them how to present to their fellow students and also how to present in future times like jobs. The presentation will also help them master the skills of presenting. When a student designs the projects, the student will give the students extra time to work on it because teachers will give students less time on their project and expect the students to be prepared when they are not. Furthermore, the students will decide if they need to present to teachers because most students are nervous to do that. And also they have not mastered the skill of presenting yet. The students will also decide how many words will be in each slides, how many slides they need, and how many minutes they need to present. Most of the times, teachers give students less time to present. Due to the less time, students won`t be able to finish what they have in mind or what they have to say and they will have to be rushed to finish before time is over. And if the students didn`t reach the time given or went over the time given, points will be deducted. But when the students chooses how they want their presentations to be, they are more likely to work on it more than when a teacher tells them how to do their own presentations. The third reason is because the student-designed project will be less harder for students to do. For example, there was a project my history teacher assigned us to do, it was a project about the Progressive Era to make sure that we understand what it was all about. We had to come up with a creative title and 3 categories for the project. It was hard for us to do because we had to come up with a creative title that connects with the topic and 3 categories that 20 sub-heading can fit on one of them. If it was a student designed the project, it would be less harder because either the title is given to us, or we don`t have to create one. And also the 3 categories will be given to use to make it a little more easier. Then all we have to do is put the 20 sub-heading in their right categories and also insert some images where it suppose to be. Another example was when my AVID teacher gave a project about researching the college of our choice. It`s great that we had to choose the college of our choice, but the questions and the rubric was unclear. They were almost the same question and it was difficult for us to answer it because we couldn`t give the same answer to all the questions. Even though some people say that teacher-designed will be so much better because students will tend to take it seriously than a student-designed; however, student-designed is better because its made by a student and it will less stressful, while teacher-designed will be a lot harder and frustrating to do. In conclusion, student-designed is better because its more fun, engaging, and easier to do than teacher-designed. Students need more time towork on their projects while spending time with families and friends. It`s great to have fun while learning and not stress out over a project during summer break. Schools need to give students an opportunities for them to design a projects for their follow students, and to show their skills and talents.

Students always have something different to eat. Some students get bored of eating the same lunch here and there so, why not have a healthier lunch. If the change in the menu where to happen most students would not get bored or complain about their food.

112,2241,7B5BC2343286,"In some Societies, students are expecting to identify a career by the time they enter to high school,Their courses of study in high school are selected to guide them toward a specific careers and take the classes they need for the career to practices more and be more specific in the career and have more thinks to know how it work for them, in some career they need a lot of think to try it and they need practice to be in high level of the career and at young age they are expecting what career they want to take when they get older and get to high school. I think thats good idea for students to commit to a career at young age, because some career are really hard to take it and if they start talking about what career they can take from young age, they would know more about how the career work, and before they get to high school some of them would know what kinda of classes they can take and how it work to get better practice in the career because some career are really hard to take it, but some are not that hard to take it, but in high school they are many classes about careers and they talk about it and it work. When they get to high school, they can ask what are better courses for this career and what is better for this career and get information. When they are younger they are thinking in many career and they talk to the teacher whats better in this career and what kinda classes they can help and bring up better in the career, When they get to high school the thinking in many more career and getting more ideas about careers and see which one is better and talk about it. and when they get age when they have take classes for the career they getting more ideas about the career. By the time of the classes they meet someone who knows the about careers and they ask what they need for take classes, and visit the college or make a field trip and meet with the company of the career, before they get to high school, they trying to be better in every classes they have and have good grades and take important classes that work for the career and trying to take everything what they need for the career and important thinks learning everything. Most students from young age are thinking in career, when they start middle school are think what kinda of career they can take when they get to high school, and when they get to high school they are looking for the classes about their career, and see what can they do to learn more about what they think in their career and see how can they do to take it, and do the best with their classes to complete the career for their job and take about what they need for the college. I think thats a good idea to be thinking from young age, so when they get to high school they already know what career they gonna take and what kinda classes they work for their career and be prepared for collage, and from younger age they are learning more about what they wanna be when they get older, When they get to their college they would have more experience with their career, because they start thinking from young and they take course that help for their dreams with the career.

So it is said Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" Like i said we all have our own idividuality that what makes us we have our own way of being, own name and own way of looking we are just our selves. Specifically individuality shows us that not everything should be given to you if you want something you work hard for it but also its a sign of your own development that you can do everthing by your self but its because you are who you are and no one can change you. Therefore, itis proven that its better to be individual than anybody else just giving you everything by hand . ""FREEDOM!"" is a good word all of us love to hear. When you realize you can do anything by yourself you feel like no one can stop or as free as the wind but theres always going to be obsticles without a doubt. To be Indivdual it can happen to any one such as a kid who has learned to do thier stuff alone or when you move out of your parents house and get your own home. It honestly can happen to anyone becuase thiers so many types to define the word individual. well to fell free is not a bad thing after all . When your individual you mean something to this world because you think about yourself. You set your own goals and accomplish them and you maintian yourself the way you are its even more better becuase its the hugest goal anybody should have to not let anybody change you wreck all you have accomplished. To your self you feel like you value your self and its not bad at all to value yourself because it biulds self confidence within you and that means you have you feet on the ground and yeah your ready to face any obsticale. No one should define you except you because the world will defenitly try to change you but if you dont aceppt it wont happen like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment"" whom we have someone to look up to and understand that to be inividual is okay.",5,5,6,6,7,6,3214,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
114,2546,5DD1954E47A8,"How old were you when you decided what you wanted to do for a living? Some schools are requiring students to choose their career before entering high school, witch shouldnt be done. Although it is understandable that students know witch career path they would like to take to start preparing early. Students should not be choosing their careers at a young age as they are to young and inexperienced with the world, should be more focused on enjoying their childhood and lastly should work up slowly to decide what they would like to be when they grow up. Students before high school are to young to choose a career path, as they most likely do not have much responsibilities. For example a child with little experience on responsibility might choose a career that requires you to be very responsible. The child with little experience on responsibility will quickly be stressed and overwhelmed and will most likely under preform. An older student will have more responsibilities and will have more experience, most likely will choose a career that will be a better fit for them and require responsibilities they are comfortable handling. Young students shouldnt be extremely focused on what career path they want to take. They should be more focused on enjoying their childhood. By engaging in extracurricular activities such as: sports, music, reading and acting. By participating hobbies they enjoy being a part of. The students will explore and experience more witch will help them as they get older in choosing what they like and what they would like to do for living by simply having fun. As we only have one childhood and we shall enjoy it while it last. A way of introducing careers to young students without making them commit to a specific one. Is having classes in schools that teach a specific career such as: construction, engineering, agriculture and law enforcement. By providing classes like this to children they will be open to explore new things without committing to one career. Slowly introducing different careers to students by having extra classes. Is a good way for them to start thinking about their future without making them choose one specific career. Overall students at a young age should not be choosing their careers. It its way to much stress for a child. They are way too inexperienced in responsibility. Should be focused on enjoying their childhood. Introducing different careers at a young age without making them commit is helpful way. This will slowly introduce them to different careers without making them commit to one and risk stressing them out. In conclusion students will wait till their time comes in high school and they will select their career path from there.

He believes that there is so much that can be done if we are always doing something because if you are doing something all the time even if its little it can be done but may take time. I believe we accomplish more if we are always doing something for example if you dont practice everyday then you wont get better at soccer. There is a lot of things that need be done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism , if we do something about that everyday to end racism. If you are always doing something then you will get a lot done. When your building a house you are always doing something to it but if you stop then it will more time to build. I always believed that i can do a lot if im doing something all the time. When i was little i use to make Legos i would always build them, i was always doing something to them. My mom always told if im building them everyday i could get done fast. I prepare for school the same way when i have big projects. When i have big projects i tend to freak out. My mom tells to just break it down and do little bit of everyday. When i do that i get my projects done fast. If you dont practice everyday then yo wont get better at soccer. If you want to be professional soccer you will have to work everyday. When you dont do that you wont get any better because you have to train everyday so you can be great at soccer. I use to play soccer 2 years ago and i wasnt practicing everyday so i didt get any better. My dream was to be a soccer player but i wasnt training everyday so i didnt get where i wanted too. Everyone has dream to be something in order be that you have to do something everyday to reach your dream. Most people dont make their dreams because they dont do the little things that matter everyday. There is a lot that need to done in our country. One of the most important thing is racism. I believe we can end racism by doing something about it everyday. One of the most important things in this country is racism because a lot people are getting killed by it. Police officer shooting black men that didnt do anything. That causes people that have been killed familys pain. I think racism needs to end as soon as possible. A lot white police men are shooting black men and are not getting anything for it. I think they should at least get some punishment because its not fair to the people who died familys. I believe this could be fixed if we all come together and do something about it everyday. As you have read we accomplish more when we are always doing something. Only when we do something you accomplish more. By doing something everyday you can accomplish your dreams and get your work done. The world would be in better place if we everyone did something to make the world more cleaner and safe.

Are you impress of how some persons can have more than one career, do you wonder how they make that happen, how they did it, how thwy make it until the end. People who knows a lot of things means that they have been trying differents things. People should try to do more things because trying new things is like an adventure, people learn more things and growing makes you a better person. Trying new things is like an adventure. When people do something that they did not know or want it to know more about it, they look at that like a new experience, something that they would enjoy to do.

Know she can make pupusas and cakes, but not only that, she was trying to do different stuff, so know she almost have her own restaurant. She demonstrate me that doing more than I know is awesome, that it can teach me new things and that I am capable of doing more than I know. People learn more things. When people try to do something they start by trying and when they try, they fail and when they fail they learn something new, so next time that they try do not make the same mistake.

I would be stuck if I hadnt try. My sister is in middle school, she likes to do sports, she knows how to play some but not others. In her school after school they make clubs about sports. Last semester they had a club about basketball, she didnt know how to play basketball, but she wanted to learn, she wanted to try something knew. She enjoy the club and she learnd how to play basketball, know in this semester they have a club about volleyball, she doesnt know how to play volleyball, but she wanted to learn something more, know she is in the club of volleyball. She learn how to play 2 sports, she is growing in knowledge of sport, if she can play volleyball and basketball that means she can play any sport she likes or wants. She knows that if she wants to success she need to try and if she fail, she need to try again until she made, that knowing one thing doenst mean thats all she can do. Unless people try to do something beyond what they know, they will never grow. They need to do things to know who they are, what makes them special, what can they do, what are capables of, what can they do, in what they are good, how they feel doing something. Doing something means growing, growing in knowledge, education, skills and more. People who do more than they know, makes them smarter, they try new things, things that they didnt know that they could do. When people want to do something beyond what they know they would fail, but failing doesnt mean you cant do it, failing means you are almost gaining what you want, you are almost reaching your goal, you are doing great, because you know what to do and what not to do. Just because something did not go like you wanted doenst mean it didnt work, it mean something went bad and you dont need to do it again, so next time that you try you already know what not to do.

All the failures have a lesson for your life, the first reason why a failure give you a lesson is because. If you never do it wrong you will never learn about the failure. Second you learn about the failure when you made it before and you do again but now you do it good for example.

You went to your work and its your first day and your boss told you that you have to finish all of your signatures 10 minutes before the end of the day , and you finish it 15 minutes after , your boss can get mad and give you a warning and you have to get it like a motivation to do your best the next day and keep going. Each failure make you more stronger and make you be alert on your next step. The failure coming and coming on ours life sometimes it come hurt and sometimes it doesnt, all of those make you more stronger, give you a lesson and make you be alert for dont get it mistake again. It make you more stronger means that you dont gonna feel weak again when you commit a mistake , also you gonna be alert and take your precautions on your next step for example. If you are on a team of soccer and you are the goalkeeper, and while you are talking with a friends , one of the other team hit the ball and make a score it was your fault.

Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves. First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff. Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents. Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do.

Finally, most of the time specially (young girls and boys) when they decided something always is wrong because they only care they self but that decisions can affect other people. For expample I from Generic_City and in my country all the time you see young people make the decision to drop out of school and get to the gangs. As a result, they get to the jail or they died and the only people who cry is your family bacuse they want all the best for you. In conclusion make decisions is not easy for each one because some are easily and some are hard, but I think you shoot ask all the time first for help with your parents and with experts because they have a lot experienced.

126,370,3991A6F647D3,"Why is not a good idea to conserve energy and resources in the school ? Some students said that is a good idea, because is less than energy, and we can safe more resources but,I think that when we have homeworks and we dont have computers in our homes we have to make that homework in the school, library ,warhawtime or in the classroom but what happened if we dont have energy in the computers ? We can fell some points of this class for not make that homework on time . Is this happened in two hours of a day of school imaginated four days of school ? This can be a problem for students because we dont have resources to make our homework on time ,and we can feel really bad about this problem ,we can have problem with our parents too. Some students have the resources in their houses because they parents can pay for that and is the reason why they said yes is fine to conserve energy and resources in the school ,but other students they cant because their parents cant pay , or others reasons like they dont have their parents here, they have just mom and their mom have more daugthers or brothers and she have to pay rent ,car ,bills we really dont no but are a lot reason why they cant pay for internet . I think that energy and resources in the schools is not a bad idea, but for some students is a good option to make homework and enjoy of them with accesible confidence, if we dont have energy for four days of school can be really hard to make everything at the same time like other students because we are a lot students and we cant use that same computer at the same time because is not the same homework or is not easy to find it and we can take more time then others, thats why I think that is not a really good idea for all students, Other students think in not because some students use that internet just for see facebook or video games and they lose time that other can use , but they cant talk for everyone because some students use that internet for really good reasons like homework , read books , and other things . Other reason to not conserve energy can be the air conditioner if we dont have energy the air conditioner is doest work and depends how is outside the weather can be affect at the students, and teacher because what if is snow outside and we dont have air conditioner we can get sick or pain in bones, if we dont have energy we cant charge the phones and we cant talk with our parents or if we have an emergency and we dont have energy how we called at the ambulance ,is thats why energy is a really good resource to comunicated with other and make somethings importants . In benefits ,we can safe more energy because we use the energy just in limited time , the bill of the energy in the school can be less than then before and we can have more resources for our school too .We can have differents activities outside. In conclusion , if we dont have energy for four days of school ,everything can be hard for us ,some businesses can be conserve energy and resources because is a different condition in their business , but for schools the energy is a good resource to the knoledge of the students .

127,742,FD48D4BB6F06,"Students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. First of all, this will let students be less stress from going to school and receiving their education. Students can also work at their own pace at home in a relaxing enviroment which I think works best. Lastly, this would give students more free time for themselves and choose whatever they want to do what they cant do during the day. Most students around the United States dislike waking up early in the morning and having to take the long proccess of getting ready and parents yelling at them ""Wake up"" or ""The bus is going to leave you"". There are some schools that offer online classes that benefit students from going to school and taking the classes online. I think this would help all students from stress becasue you wont have to think about early morning wake ups. This would help students not having to deal with overloads of work stressing about ""where did I put my papers"" and losing valuable homework. This also helps with time management. Students wont have to go to school for more than 7 hours and be stuck in class sleep deprived and would just be at home taking there time with there classes online. Furthermore, this would help students getting into trouble at school and dealing with teachers about whos right and whos wrong. In addition, students would benefit even more becasue they would work at there own pace. Students can take time by working in each subject at there pace and wont be rushed by and teachers or anybody. I think this is a great way for students to build self-indepence for the real world becasue they will be on there own and have to manage there time wisely and accordingly. I also think you can get more worked down where the you can choose a place at home or a nearby coffee shop where students dont have distractions. Students can also engage with other students if they taking the same materials and help each other out. Moreover, this allows students to have more free time and social time to themselves. Many students these days want to have some change in there pockets and find partime jobs. This would allow students to either choose a job or a hobby they like to pursue during the day since they wont be physically at school. Most students can join a sport they like and also have plenty if time to condition and practice to get better. In conclusion, students would benefit from being able to atttend classes from home. I would reccomend many schools should have online classes for students who just dont feel school isnt where they can learn but at home they can enjoy there comfort and still excel.

129,2881,DA26E5E2C08E,"Many people believe that teenagers should have a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays and during mindnight weekends. In my opinion I say having a 10 p. m curfew on the weekdays for teens that works and get out of work late might not be a good idea. Another example can be, you never know when an emergency can happen at your house and or anywhere else and you have no one to pick you up or an emergency hoccurs at your house and you have no one to take you, at least you got your son/daughter to help you out. Lastly during high school is when you get a lot of projects to take home and when you have test the next day and a project due before that can be a hand full and it can stress them out, by letting them do their work and have more time to study, it improves their grades in school and they do better in their classes. I have a lot friends that as soon as they get home they get ready to go to work, and most of them come out at 10 p. m but by the time they get home it can a little more passed 10 p. m depending how far their job is from their house. Many teenagers help to support their family in whatever they can, having a job that can help them support your family is truly a good help. Letting your son work passed 10 p. m is not something you want to get in between due to thier boss changing their schedule sometimes and if hes helping you out by giving you money to pay a bill or to go buy food for the house its worth him/her working a little late. I have friends that work very hard in school and after they home they change, they put on their uniform and they go to work to bring food the house due to his mom not getting payed good enough at her job. Others work to buy themselves their own needs, for exmaple when they have school dances and you need to buy a ticket and your mom has no money, by working you can buy a ticket and attempt to the dance. Another example is prom, prom can be one of the most exiting activities high school has, but it can also be very expensive if you have no money and your trying to look nice and presentable. You never know when an emergency can occur at your house and you have no one to call or help you out. I once had a friend that his mom was pregnant and he had little sibblings that could not drive but him, and as the pain started to get worst he took her the Hospital and thank god everything turned out fine for them but the reaon they didnt call anyone else for help due to the fact they were new in the city and didnt knew anybody and it was passed midnight, so his older son carried her to the car and drove her to the Hospital. You never know when an emergency can happen to you or someone in your family at anytime. Another example was when my dad and I drove to Walmart to buy my mom some medicine because she had a bad fever and a headche and we left the house exactly at 10:30 p. m and when we got back home we gave her medicine and the next day she felt a lot better. During high school is where I have gotten a lot of projects that are hard to make and thier due two days later, not only do I be having projects, I be having homework from all my teachers and test that I need to study. Staying up late to complete your work can most definately help you complete your work or at least do more than what you couldnt had finished if you were to sleep at 10 p. m. Whenever I have a lot in mind like projects, homework, make-up work and test that I need to study really be stressing me a lot until a point where I feel like im being rushed and I cant concetrate right if I have other things in mind that I need to get done. But by having no curfew you can go to bed late, but at least you were calmed about it and you werent rushing into getting it done, when you took your time. Many people can see 10 p. m curfew as something that should be done, but think about the consequences that it can have for example, not being able to work and help your family because can work passed 10 p. m or you never know when something can happen to anybody at anytime and theres noone to help out, or when you need more time to complete your project that you werent able to finished due to curfew. Think about many other things that can be done, other things that can help others.",6,6,7,7,6,7,3064,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us.

The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not.

140,3247,0BB9FAE6E27B,"Setting A Good Example Have you thought of set an example for your own behavior? Albert Schweitzer said ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing."" Setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people. However; others believe that their are better ways to influence others because the person being influenced should set their own examples not everyone wants to follow someone examples. Although not everyone thinks the same its better to set an example by your own behavior to influence others. People get influenced by demonstrations, peoples mistakes and when visualizing things. To influence someone you have to set an example for them to visualize what you are trying to influence them to do. Most people get influence when presented demonstrations through videos, presentations and pictures. My favorite youtubers influence me by spreading postivity through their videos and content. They help the homeless by providing them shelter; they make peoples day by helping them with their needs. They influence me to want to help the homeless and other people. These youtubers Influence their subscribers to spread posivity throughout the world by the examples they set on their videos. A lot of people learn from others mistakes; setting a good example from your own behavior will influence others not to do your mistake in your example because they will take it into concerdation. One of my friends told me their experience on missing their opportunity of taking a course required for graduation. She did not get to graduate on time she stayed one more year in high school to complete the course she missed. She regretted not taking the course her junior year to graduate on time. My friend influenced me to take the class my junior year and to learn from her mistakes. I didnt miss my opportunity I got to take the course and earned the credit for it. I learned from her example she influenced me by telling me to follow her example to accomplish it. Most people dont believe things until they see an example of things. Theyre are people that need to visualize things to get influenced by them. Its confirmed that most influencers present things that you can visualize to influence people. I am a person that needs to see an example of something in order to believe it. When I am searching information I need to see if it is fiction or non fiction. Once I researched up the wrong information for a presentation the article didnt state a true event. I got a bad grade for the presentation as my consequence I had an F that quarter for not stating a true fact. Influencers set examples of their own behavior to influence you the right way. Others believe that there are better ways to influence others by letting the person being influenced set their own example. The person being influenced can not set their own examples if they dont have experience. People need to follow someone example because they need to be influenced before they can influence others by setting their own examples. All influencers have been influenced by others examples they didnt set their own example. Following an influencers example will help the person being influenced learn from their mistakes and improve from them to set better examples to others being influenced. Albert schweitzer set his own examples from his own behavior to influence others. He was Inspired by other influencers examples and that it was the only thing to help influence others. He says that the best way to influence other people is to set a good example by your own behavior. You should follow someone examples by their own behavior to set a good example to influence others.

142,2993,60623DB5DE7A,"Four-day work week, a remarkable idea to conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted the idea of a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. I think this idea is amazing, workers would have a day off and they wont be wasting energy and resources like in a regular day of work. Therefore i think my school should follow this model and extend the school day two hours in a four-day school week. Students would be happy of having a day off, and most of them would support the idea of having a four-day school week. By following this idea, my school would conserve energy and a lot of resources such as papers, school materials, food, etc. A four-day school week benefit students and teachers in many ways, students would have a day off and time to do extra curricular activities such as sports or work, teachers would be at home and have time to spend with their kids and be with the family, and all of us would be conserving energy and resources. One disadvantage of having a four-day school week is that some parents work 5 days a week in different companies and these companies might not have the four-day work week so they wont have time to be with their kids at home in the day off, and some of them would be forced to change their five-day work week to a four-day work week, so they can be with their kids at home. Personally, i would prefer the four-day school week, because,i have a part-time job after school , it is from 5 to 10pm, and having a day off would allow me to have time to do some extra work at home and to change my schedule for in the morning so i can have the rest of the day to work on my stuffs, have time to chill, or maybe to do my homework, and help my mom with whatever she needs. Having a four-day school week, would let me have time to do a lot of things during the day, for example, babysit my little brother if my mom goes out, go to the gym or maybe help my dad. I can get another job to work on the weekends, the thing is that it would allow me to be busy, and to generate money. In my family, my dad is the one who is always at work, he works from 8am to 6pm everyday, he doesnt have a day off, but it is okay for him. My mom, she doesnt work, she is always at home taking care of me and my little brother, for my parents, it wouldnt be a problem for me to have four days of school a week, because my mom would take care of me during that day off. In conclusion, i think having a four-day school week, would benefit a lot of people, because just like me, there are plenty of students that would love to work more and generate money, and for the teachers, well they would enjoy have a day off and spend time with their kids at home.",9,7,8,8,8,9,1252,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

They have to learn everything by culture and family. Every culture has different impression but we have to caught it because we are human. Everybody has a lot of impression. Many people would have different opinion about this statement. In my opnion, I am disagree with that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture, practice can change anything, and they are adjustable. First reason, I believe that first impression are not impossible to change because all people are live in culture and culture change impression. One person has more than one impression and different culture has different impression. People make comfortable with new impression. For example, I born in bangladesh but I live in USA. I have a different impression than before becuse now I am live in new culture, they have new impression. Almost I forget my old impression because USA culture change my impression. People help us to change our imression because whatever we see around us we can hold it. Another reason, I am not agree with that first impression are impossibe to change because practice can change anything. People dont want to do whatever they dont like. But if you do everyday whatever you dont like oneday you will like it because practice can make anything perfect . For example, my friend who came from bangladesh without family even she disnt know anything about this place. But she have to do everthing her ownself. Everyday she is practice new culture thats make her to learn new impression. Now she doesnt remember her old impression becuse if you practice everyday new things. You will forget old impression becasue she doesnt preactice her old impression. Finally, I disagree with that first impression are almost impossible to change because people are adjustable. In the world, people are the only things who can adjust themself to any other new things. When we went to the new place we have to do lot of new things. Even we have to change our impreassion because every place has different kind of impression. And people can adjust themself with new impression. For example, people impression are like water. Doesnt matter where you put water it will be shape like where you put water because water is liquid and people mind is changeable. When we go to the new place we have to have change our impresson and it doest matter who you are and where you are. In conclusion, people have to say that first impression are not impossible to change because people live in culture, practice can change anything, and people are adjustable with new things. Most of people wouldnt agree with that statement. We dont have to believe that whatever other people said. People has a right to say whatever they believe. Human beings are adjustable with impression becasue we are changeable. Whatever we can imagine we can do it. Everything is possible for human.

The second reason is that I want to inspire other people that might be overweight and give them hope that they can lose weight. My Third and final reason is that losing weight is just better for me in general it would boost my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. To better explain my first reason I will talk more about it. The reason was that losing weight would be better for health. You see bad things can happen to you when you are overweight such things as diabetes that is a sickness that is a result of being overweight. Some overweight people find it difficult to walk or to do something simple because they are carrying all that extra weight on them. In fact i sometimes find it hard to do exercises in gym class that most people would find easy to do. There are many heath risks when it comes to being over weight and thats one of the reasons I want to lose weight. The second reason I want to lose weight is because I would like to inspire other people that are overweight to try and lose wight. If I lost weight that could encourage other people to lose weight as well because they can say to themselves a person who was were I am lost weight and I can do the same. I have a saying its ""when you help someone you help everyone"" an example for that saying would be if I helped someone want to lose weight they might feel the need to help other lose weight. So I hope that I could influence a sort of butterfly effect starting with me inspiring someone to lose weight and that person inspiring someone else and so on and so on. If I lose weight knowing that I lost weight not only helping myself but also others I would be proud of myself. My third and final reason to lose weight is that it would be better for my self esteem and help me be not so self conscious. If you have any insecurities than you know what is like to want to get rid of those insecurities. One of my many insecurities is my weight and I think that if I got rid of that insecurities it would better my self conscious and make me think good about myself. I just plainly think that I would be better off losing weight because I would think better of my self. In conclusion one thing I want to accomplish in life is lose weight. There are several more reasons I could list but those are my main and biggest reasons I want to lose weight. I want to lose weight because its healthy,because I want to inspire people to do the same,and because I want to boost my self esteem.

Identifying a career by the time the students enter to High-School, is probably a chance to see if they are actually interested in the career that they had in mind, when they were in middle school. This is the time when you have to start picking ideas for what you want to be when get older. This doesnt mean that your not allow to change your mind in the future, is just a help from the school to see if you are interested in what you want to do when you get older. You have four years in high school to change your mind. There is so many careers that you could like; the school will provide you the classes that you need in order to graduate, and also classes that talk or teach you about the career that you pick. Thats when you have to start thinking if thats what you actually like, and remember that whatever you pick, is not permanent for your entire life, because you can change your mind any time. Dont stress out a lot, because as a freshman you can change your mind for the year that is coming up. You have another year to pick new classes and see what is that you actually want to be. Identifying a career by the time the students enter to high school, is probably a chance to see if they are actually interested in the career that they had in mind. You have around ten month in school, in those ten month you have the chance to know more about the career that you pick in the beginning, so while the time past by, you can see if you are actually interested in the career for your future. If is not what you thought it was going to be, then for your next year you can talk to your counselor about it, and they will help you giving you advises, because they are allow to see you grades, so they will see in what classes you doing good, so they can help you pick a career that you would probably like. Student have the right to change their mind any time that they want, because the 75% of the students that are in High-School are not mature enough to actually think in their future, most of them are not ready for life. When you are in your last year of high school, is when you have to start getting ready with what you actually like, and see whatever classes that you had picked in the beginning of high High-School was actually what you wanted to be in the future; because after that you will be going to collage. It is a good idea to give the students the chance to identify their career in the beginning of High-School. Also their mind will change every year, the years that actually matter in order to go to collage is junior and senior years. Those years are the ones that you have to get ready and actually put on your mind that any classes that the school will put you in will be a guide toward the specific career that you have picked. The classes that you have in High-School is just a help to open your mind for the career that you could have in the future. It can be helpful for some students and for others it would not matter at all. It is not necessary to identify only one career when you are just entering to High-School, because you are most likely to change your mind and ideas about the career. There is a chance that you will forget what you wanted to be as a young age. While the time past by there will be so many other cool career that you will be interested to do, or to learn more about. When you are picking your classes and your counselors and you talk about your future, or what would you like to do when you go out of High-School; is a good chance to let them know your ideas and your goals, so they will know what classes to put you in so it can help you as guide for your career and also for collage. In conclusion, giving the students the chance to pick classes that will guide them toward their career, can be helpful for them to see if they are actually interested in that career or no.

Act of kindness are everywhere from picking up trash to doing your brother or your sisters chores one day they will realize something about why you wash their dishes everyday. I think kindness is the most important personality of a human being why i think kindness is a important personality? You can change peoples mind or the way how they think about some stuff, for example if you can help someone to get across street when their is too much traffic you are doing a act of kindness, and you can help change other kids minds by making them think about their parents who is trying to cross the street trust me they will jump right in. One important thing about kindness is that you always need to have a positive set of mind that means that if someone is asking you for help jump right in and help him dont just answer ""I dont know"" if you actually dont know where the place is try asking someone else if they know about the place the other person is talking about. Some people take kindness in a negative way only some people and at a certain time some people like to do stuff on their own and sometimes they like their own time and own place and own work they dont any help from others like me sometimes I like to do stuff on my own, but sometimes I need someone to help me. I would like to help people in need for example; taking out someone else trash, helping my new neighbors settle in the community, and mow my new neighbors lawn. kindness can open many opportunities some people even think that kindness is a part of their religion and I really think it should be a part of every religion because it can really help you and people around you and you can change each others mind or opinion on one thing by kindness,all these thing just does not sound it is possible but it could be. To be honest I think that kindness is one of my superpowers if you ask me but sometimes its not but those times without kindness goes by quickly with kindness on your side you can become anyone you want and be a bigger person that everyone. In these days people who understand kindness they are actually showing kindness and they are also telling us to be kind to each other. I feel like kindness has become a big part of peoples life in 2019-2020 and i expect the same or more amount of kindness over generations and I also feel like that the person who really teaches us kindness in childhood is our parents.",7,7,6,8,7,6,1412,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I am in disagreement with this prompt that it has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, because just imagine clearly your first impression it may not be the same when at first you start knowing someone, when at first you meet someone, or even when at first you look someone by the first time, people may also said that is impossible to assume your first impression at someone, because your perspective of someone may be different from another perspectives of others, you may have the same perspective or also different from other people. The day when at first came to United States it was really hard for me and for my family from Mexico, I was really nervous and also a little scared, it was one of my dreams that became real, I was so impressed and surprised of everything, the first impression that I used to have of United States changed, now that I am living in United States, the impression is different because now I know how is to live in a different country. Not always is going to be how you thought it would be, but it can be even better, even thought your impression was different or was the same at the beginning.

I disagree with that because our character formed by influences beyond our control, for example we all leaned whats right or wrong, lets take a babies for example the leaned for people all around them, by seeing what they do for example how they speak, how they walk and how they dress. the only they can not be influences by other people if their parent stop then from doing all those things. take me for example as a baby grow up speaking french because thats that the Language. when I moves to my grandma place she speak Spanish with me so now I speak Spanish, and french I could never speak those languages if I was not influence by those around me. I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who Im today? Was I influence by someone? Or did I choose to become who Im? I disageer with that ""character will be what you yourself choose to make it.""

154,2830,B558AFC603D4,"There was a girl named Generic_Name, and she wanted to play violin like she used to. Generic_Name was struggling. It was not easy on getting back to playing it. Generic_Name practiced everyday no matter what. Generic_Name made a lot of mistakes on the way, but successed at the end. When you accomplished something; you have failed before you could have successed. Failing can cause before you succeed because you try to get where you are, you make mistakes, and you can make the wrong choices. To begin, failing can lead to succes because it happen before you succeed. For an example, you tell yourself that you will get your work done for all of your classes. Then you end up not understanding the work, but tried and turned it in the work. It can also be doing all your chores before you could go out and be with your friends. For another example, you had a lot of chores to do. It was getting late and you have finished all of your chores. At the end you could not go out, but finshed with all of the chores. It can also deal with reading a book. For an example, you want to read a hard book and finsh it, but you end up reading a different level and finshed the book. These examples show that you fail before you can succeed. Secondly, failure happens before you can accomplish anything because everyone makes mistakes. It can be when someone is trying to make a cake. For an example, you try to combine the inderigdeints, but they were not the right indergridents, Then next time, they put in the right inderigents. It can also be about when someone is trying to practice on their drving skills. For an example, The driver prcatices everyday, but makes many mistakes. Later on, gets better at it. People can aslo make mistkes by giving poeple directions on where to go. For an example, a lady needed help to get the location at the supermarket. The lady asked an old man where it was. The old man gave the direction, but made a mistake where the superamlrket was at. Then the old man told the lady that it was the other way. All of these examples show that mistakes can happen before you can success. Lastly, failing can cause by just making the wrong choice. Such as a girl wanted to tryout for outdoor track, but she loved playing softball. The girl tried out for track and made the team. There was a problem, she couldn[t be on the softball team because it was too late. The softball teamwas full. At the end, the girl should of made a better choice. It can also be about how you want to turn out your day. For an example, the boy wanted his day to be fun, but the boy was paying attention in his classes so he was sent to the offfice. This turned out to a bad day. Then he apologized and made his day better. This all shows that making the wrong choices can lead to failing on what you decide. This all sums up, that failure can cause before you succeed. Others say that failure does not happen when you succeed, however, I say that it does play out before you can success. Failing will always occur when you succeed. You push yourself where you want to be, you make errors, and doing the wrong decision are all reasons why failure can happen before you can success. Do you think there is failure even when you succeed. ",8,8,6,7,7,6,2442,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
155,3585,344D7B1A7E49,"I agree with Emersons statement. Why would some people never grow up? Some people may have childish personality so its most likely that the person wont be able to change much. The three reasons are: your attitude, violence, and lastly friends that some people are using you and say some harsh things when your not around. Some may say that some people will be able to change. They are wrong because some people wont be able to change how they act towards you. My first reason is attitude: some people wont be able to change to change your attitude towards them, and wont be able to change how you act towards them. For example, I sometimes have a very bad attitude towards my sister, Generic_Name. I always yell at my sister, Generic_Name for asking me to do something or give her something even though shes younger than me by three years. My second reason is violence: Some people wont be able to change their violence, and some people my end up hurting their closest friends. For example, back in middle school I was always a sweet girl who doesnt hurt people, but after, when I cut my hair some people end up calling me names which made me upset and I started to get a little violent towards the people who call me names. Im still sweet towards my friends who understands how I feel when someone call me names, but I also try very hard to control my violence so I wont get in trouble. The second example is: My youngest sister, Generic_Name gets violent when my other sister, Generic_Name gets her angry. Afterwards, she tries very hard not to get violent just like me. My last reason is friends: Some people wants to use you for money because they wanted to buy clothes only for themselves. The other one is some people will act nice, but, when you leave they will say very cruel things to you. For example, I watch my favorite movie where the popular, mean girls are acting friendly to the new girl, but when the new girl leaves the popular, mean girls say harsh things about her so the new girl wont be able to hear them. In conclusion, why would some people never grow up? The way the person is acting childish would make them not change that much. I agree with Emersons statement, because some people can be very childish, and its most likely wont be able to change that much. The three reason are: some people have a very bad attitude, sometimes get very violence, and lastly some people may use you and say very cruel things about you when your not there.",7,8,7,6,6,8,678,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

157,245,7999A063F80E,"I agree that praising a students work is an outstanding idea to jump start a students path to success,but praise is not the way to increase their self-esteem. By overpraising a student his or her confidence has to be on a different level. Students will also have a harder time dealing with constructive criticism. However, if a student works really hard to achieve something,then that feeling of completion can motivate them to continue to their path of success. Getting your business done without any praising and knowing you put your all into it could make you feel way better about yourself and it would just not motivate you but the people around you. I say this because people dont usually thank you or give you any comments they usually mean. You would never know what could come out someones mouth. They wouldnt want to agree with this but, thats because we all think different and most of us know the real meaning behind something similar to this. If you achieve something and you keep on achieving things in life you will get many blessings. People dont usually know the difference between praising and achieving your goal without it. You dont need people telling you about your work or whatever you are doing because at the end of the day youre the only one who knows what youre accomplishing in life. Teachers should let students achieve their goals and not worry about what the other person has to do or say. By accomplishing something could make you learn new things in life too. People get confused and dont get the message, we need more people to believe in their selves and not about what other people have to say. Although I think its nice of people complimenting and saying positive things about your work but, I still have to go with achieving it on your own.

It wont help us in the future because all you need to learn is how to get a good job, pay for bill and electricity, food, gas, and water.

Students like to listen to music, party, go on social media, sports, video games, talking to friends, and being cool. But they dont want to sit in class with a bunch of nerds that paint, make clay and draw. Students should not be required to take a class they dont like. It should be optional just like band class. Some students might fail the class because they either dont like being there and just skip the class or theyre not that good at making clay or drawing. For drama it should be optional too since all you do is make an act and speech and it has nothing to do in students futures. Music class is what students will find most interesting but it has nothing to do with students futures either. These classes are something that are easy, Something that you are good at, and something that interests you.

159,1673,5CA2DCC616C6,"Energy had become the most usable thing in the world; without energy students couldnt be able to find information for their homework or projects. In this life time is the most valuable thing students can lose. Although students would have a three-day weekend, they would not lose any minute of class, nevertheless they would have more time to work because they would go to school only four days per week, which would give them more time to earn more money at work, spend more time with family and friends, and do their homework and projects on those three-day weekend. To begin, energy is the most usable thing everyone use, and if students do not start to conserve it, in the future it could be difficult to get. For example, technology in schools is advancing over the years. Teachers give homework and projects to students online where they have to use their smart phones, which need energy to get charge, so they can use them for their assignments. They also use internet, which requires energy to function. This proves that if Generic_School extend the school day two hours for a four-day school week to conserve energy and resources, teachers would have to start giving students homework in which they have to use books. Obviously, students would have to adapt to find information for their homework and projects in books, like old times, and stop using technology to find information. Furthermore, students would like the idea of having a three-day weekend. For example, they could use that time for work, spend time with family and friends, and do homework and projects. This shows that students would not miss any day of school because they would spend the same amount of hours they usually spend at school, but only in four days; the two extra hours Generic_School would extend on the schedule for a four-day week, would sum the hours the students spend on a regular week, yet they will divide that time in four days. They also can earn more money if they work more hours on those days that they would have off. Students would also have more time to study for any test they may have, or do any homework or projects. Clearly, this will be a benefit for students and teachers. They would get an extra day off without missing anything at school. Overall, students would enjoy their three-day weekend studying, working, or spending time with family and friends because they would have an extra day on the weekend.

164,1822,BB240E6FF61F,"Since the early societies with important philosophers such as Aristotle and Confucius, the world have been in a complex debate arguing about the best way to influence other people. As result, several ideas about how to influence people emerged, such as an internal agreement through the creation of the early constitution in Athens by Aristotle. Early constitution which tried to combat the earliest authoritarian ways to influence people through force. However, those ways to influence people were not effective because those factors dictate the peoples actions and created a hostile environment. Therefore, the best way to influence others is by our own behavior setting a good example because this generates stability, creates higher standards, and effectiveness. Henceforth, setting a good example generates stability because this do not create a patron of dictatorship that generate differences and hostilities between the relationship follower-influencer. As result, this factor create an ideal and healthier relationship, which is reflected in the quality of the relationship environment. As a consequence, the stability created it by our own behavior and example make our message easier to be transmit it and receive it. For example, the relationship parent-son. This particular and common relationship completely reflected the influence of a good example and how the parent behavior dictate the stability in the family, especially in his relationship with the son. As result, if the parent set a good example and behavior the son would be more open to receive the parents influence. Therefore, a high grade of empathy would be developed. As result, there would not be any differences and hostilities that can damage the stability of the relationship. However, many people still argue that there are different ways to influence others rather than setting a good example, such as internal agreements (e. i., constitution and other behavior codes). However, those ways still fall into the dictatorship and authoritarian scheme that make people disagree and create conflict. In addition, those rudimentary and forcing methods do not help the persons and the influencer-follower environment. In contrast, deteriorate and break any possibility of improvement because this authoritarian limit you, instead develop you. Therefore, by showing a good behavior and setting a good example the influencing process change drastically because this process became more active, inclusive, and dynamic. As result, this influencing way create higher standards because this method of influencing people promote values such as integration and solidarity that reach improvement and cooperation. As result, the higher standards break the authoritarian barrier and open the path for cooperation, participation, and admiration in the follower-influencer relationship. Therefore, a great example led by a good behavior becomes more effective because there is a dynamic cooperation between followers and influencers that boosted their performance and empathy in the relationship. Hence this dynamic cooperation becomes stronger, as result the relationship reach incredible stages of solidarity, which is translated into a better and healthier way to influence people. In contrast, the old ""fashioned"" authoritarian ways to influence people just deteriorate the follower-influencer relationship by dictating and forcing the followers actions. As result, the net influence, effectiveness, and impact by the authoritarian ways become lower than setting a good example and behavior. For example, the actions by the Mohammad Gandhi in India with his pacific civilian disobedience movement; where he led an incredible number of people just by example and a good behavior through the diverse hostilities. This show the huge impact of setting a good example and the effectiveness that this way have on influencing people. Therefore, setting a good example is the best way to influence others because this way is the less damaging and authoritarian, and more inclusive and beneficial method to achieve a greater result. In addition, because this method promotes solidarity and unity, instead of division and competition. Lastly, because this method highlight humanity instead of cruelty.

166,1739,D26C9B0368D0,"No, students would not benefit from being able to attend classes from home. There is a lot of action students have to take from being home school. For example the state has to make sure their doing their work instead of sleeping and lacking around. You have to be responsible and be aware of your work. Im not saying all students cant attend online classes at home, but most cannot. Going to school helps you learn and understand things better. if you dont get something, you can ask for help and the teacher can explain the problem to you. You also have a person teaching you instead of you reading things by yourself and trying to understand. Being in class accurate and up can keep you from falling asleep instead of sitting around at home eating and sleeping all day. In addition of other students because i cant speak for everybody, some students can handle that and learn way better on their own than having somebody teach them. School groups is also another reason how student learn faster and better. Working in groups help you learn more from other students. Other students may know more than you or you might know more than them, which is a good thing. Everybody has their own ideas and opinions. You cant forget some students are antisocial and like to work alone. If you are one of them people, than working alone and at home is best for you because you have nobody around to bother you. Another reason being home schooled isnt a good idea because you have to be responsible. Doing your work, making sure you up, and making sure you finishing it on time. You have to make sure you get up on time, not staying asleep to long, or staying on your phone. Being at school you have to get what you need done, at home is like you know what you need done but you can do it later. Which makes you lazy, staying at home eating,sleeping,and playing on your phone makes you lazy. Its gonna make you forget that you have school to do. On the other hand some students are responsible. They know what have to get done and they get it done with or without any one telling them what to do or reminding them. School is learning place where you come and get your knowledge from. Every parent should put their child in some learning program where they get taught not taught on their own. School is the most popular place in the world. Getting a education and great job is good reasons why you should come to school. Great job equals great money. Good education equals a high advance in getting in wonderful colleges. With out school you life wont be to bad but you know you can live a way better live with school. ",7,8,8,7,7,6,2919,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Practicing is important because. One example is when I learn how to play soccer. The person that teach me was my cousin Im still bad but Im learning. Another Example would be when I learn how to bould on fornite. I learn how to bould and sauces by my cousin. Lastly when I learn how to aim on fornite. I learn because of my cousin and he teach me how. Learning a skill Is better then not to. Being pation Is good for you for example. One time when I was trying to bould hard thing on fornite and it didnt work so i got mad. But then I tried doing net part by part and I got what I wanted. Another example would be I was Inpatient of swimming on deep water. But then I learn how to swim on deep water. When I wanted to go on a water park I was inpatient. But I learn be pation Is good. I was waiting then got in the park and it was fun. In some cases Is better to be pation then not to. Loaning a tik tok daced for me Is a skill. For example one dace would when I made my own dance. It was easy and I lorn. Another example would be a hard danced. I tried to duet but it was to hard so I quit. Lastly would be A danced that was hard but I did step by step and I enjoyed. Loaning can sometimes be fun. Practecsin is the way to success. An example would be a hard assignment that I did and it was hard. Second would be pattion when I need to. For example when I play to much games Im pattion and not getting mad. Lastly learning fun skills. Hard daces can be challenging but once I lornet it was fun.

I think students would not benefit being able to attend classes from home because they can not be on their telephone and not due what they are spouse to due. First, they can get distracted, In my position I Can get distracted went I am at home doing homework i want to wache TV even some time I do not finish my homework because i get a lot distracted. I want to play whit my brothers go out side play soccer and i say just for a little I am to playing with then but a get distracted and i for got the i have to do homework or study for a test. Some time I get distracted by seeing my brother playing video even went they is a lot of noise i get distracted because i want to what is happening or what is going on. I remember one day the I have to finish a test review at home because I do not have time to do it at school I do not finish because I get distracted by brothers. They were making a lot of noise and i could no concentrate because of then. My brothers are the same way as me they can get distracted fully easy and not pay attention on what they doing maybe they star by doing they homework but they do no finish because they get distracted by the TV or the video game. Second, they can use the telephone some time I get a lot distracted whit my telephone because I away want to be in the telephone. Went i home I just want to be in my telephone and i do not do my homework. I get fully distracted because I want to text whit my friends or playing video games in my telephone and not Du what i suppose to to do. Went I am at home I have all I want my bed my telephone the TV the I forgot the I have to how or study for a quiz or test. Only because I at home and I have all i need some time i do not want to do anything I get distracted fully easy and more if I have my telephone in front of me because i want to leasing to music or video chat my friend and talk and pay attention on what I suppose to due. Some time my mom tell that I have to stuff in the house so I have to do it even if I am doing homework or studying I have to what she say and then a can kip doing what i was doing. If I have my telephone whit me the only thing i what to do is be in the telephone because it is a easy way to get distracted and not due what you suppose to due. Some people my say that if students have home school it will be good because some students can get bully at school and they do not want to go back. The is say for then because some the students do not ride the bus the parent have to take then to school and the take a lot of time some time because they have to wait. Even they are going late for work and they do not have tame to take then to school. They may say the if they have school at home they do not have to do all the work by taking then to school. some time a lot of kids get bully at school and it more easy for then do do it by home because they do not have to deal with at school they do to have to be worry what would happen to then the net they or what does people are going to do whit then, But I chose to not have school at because some people can get distracted I not saying the all people have the problem I am just saying the i have the problem they my not have. But I do not like have home school because i want to see my friend graduate whit then have fun some time go to party and now more people have more experience. In solution, people can do what is best for you if you like do school by home because you do not like people or have personal problem or have i disability that you go it no one is going to say anything. But some time people want to have friends have fun because you are a person the like to be around people that good to. the only thing i am saying chose what is best for you not what is best for other people or what other people think.

171,3879,20E2B07931F3,"Once in a while we all have been heard a phrase; ""TRY, TRY, UNTIL YOU SUCCED"". We all have been gone through failing, at some part of our lives. But we never give up and we do our best. And at the end we get more of it. Yes we accomplish more if we are always doing something. There are few people who dont agree to this statement. They say doing something more will not let you do other work. But rather than seating ideal, we should always try new things around. Trying new things can give new experience. Also, you can get better at things. And, moreover it also makes you strong. Rather than seating ideal, doing nothing; we should always keep on trying new things. We humans always have dreams of doing things like: Sports, Cooking, Adventure activities, getting into music, dance, and many more. Doing something and trying out new things will always give you new experience. I wanted to learn guitar from my childhood but, it was not possible when i was in school. During my last summer break i joined guitar classes. It was next level experience to me. I learned so many new things which i never knew about guitar. There, i also met new people and made new friends. Meeting new people and knowing interesting facts about their lives is also a new experience. On the other hand their are some people who says trying new things dont give you experience, and it also wastes your time. But if we want to at least full fill our dreams then we have to keep on working hard. There are few people who argue; doing same things everyday wont give you anything and you will also not able to focus on other things. But thats not true. Doing same thing again and again can make you better and you can be best in the future. lets just talk about me when i joined my guitar classes. On the very first day i didnt knew nothing about guitar. Their were lots of things like: cords, tunes, vocal. This all were like a big giant algebra equation which were kept in front of me, in which i didnt even knew how to solve for x. I knew a little bit of knowledge how to play with guitar string, but i never knew much things in details. On the very first day when i went to my guitar class i was not really good. But after continuing playing for a month i actually started improving at that. And today im really good at playing guitar. There are many individual who says that trying new things is a fail. And later it demotivates you and make you feel depressed and upset. Many of us our not really good at things. We fail at many things at first. In this situation many of us give up and dont try to take a second chance. But do we actually know that failure is the biggest key to success and it also teaches you many lesson. Im not really great student who can Handel math. I failed in algebra1 in my 9th. Every test, every quiz, i used to get D or either F. But failing at same things again and again until i started getting good grades thought me so many new things. And it also made me more stronger. Failing makes you more stronger so that in future also you can fight with it. In conclusion seating ideal will never make you succeed. Trying new things is a opportunity to learn new things and explore things around you. ",7,6,6,5,6,6,437,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

173,2962,ED6070D470FF,"I despise it when someone your close to says ""you cant be like me you have to be better than that."" What right do you have to speak on what I have done, when you have done things people could not even imagine? This is why when it comes to someone you look up too or base your personality off of, make sure it is one who has credibility. Like people always say ""you are who you hang around with."" For example, being around friends who act in illegal activities your bound to do those things too. A man with honor, integrity, and takes responsibility for what he does will be respected because of his behavior. Being a good role model is especially true when it comes to children. For example, have you ever had a little cousin or your bestfriends baby sibling copy the same exact words that come out of your mouth? Be careful what you talk about around a kid because they repeat what you say; furthermore, it might not seem like it, but they can process everything you say. This is how in parts of the country people have various accents and pronounce words differently. When you grow up in a certain neighborhood or even in you household, while aging you will be using the different terms and phrases people around you use because thats all you ever known growing up. So staying away from words that cant be used in a school or around familly is your best bet. A celebrity has an even greater audience when it comes to setting an example for others. People of all types of ages watch them, they are the ones who set the trends, the news revolves around, and control social media. When a celebrity messes up they get the most hate; however, if a celebrity does a great deed like a charity event then theyre praised for it. They attract the most attention and most of those eyes are teenagers, who need the most advice and a figure to follow. For teenagers this is who decides for them if theyll be on the streets or in the books because famous people are who they spend most of their time with. Teenagers are always watching, whether on social media, a reality show, a sports game, or a movie, celebrities are dominating the world right now. No mater who it is, a person always have some type of influence on somebody. That is why you should just hold that anger in next time you get in a fight because people are watching. Do some charity or show them you cleaning up the environment; in addition, just effect others in a positive way. However some would say setting example does not matter or no one pays attention to that, it is suprising how many people are effected by a persons behavior. Showing a good example with behavior does not necessarily mean change who you are, it just means be careful of the words that are exiting your mouth. No one would want their own kid to be effected by a bad role model. ",9,8,10,9,9,8,3471,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Play games like soccer, football ride a bike, make running races with your friends, or baseball, play music but not so loud because the police may come, invite you son/daughter boyfriend/girlfriend and their parents to come to the park, maybe bring some snacks for the afternoon. Spending time outdoors with your family and friends is like having a camping day, is there is a river that you are allowed to fish, it will be a great idea to go fish and catch some fish to eat them, but the most important thing is to have fun with all your friends and family. To admire how beautiful is the nature, to forget all your problems while listening to the sound of the birds reconnect with you family and to remember how important is to the love of your family and friends, Because some people dont have family and friends and there are all alone thats why is so important how much the people around you that appreciate you so much and you have to be so thankful for that. In the night you can make fire to put mash mellow to the fire and than eat them with cookies one on top and the other one on the bot on and while eating the mash mellow the people can make a large group to tell scary story maybe some jokes but the best at the end the best part of being outdoors is the you are having fun fun with your friend and family, but also you are breathing fresh air from the nature. Community parks, state parks, and national parks are very important for the community because is a place where someone can have fun while their are with their friends, with their boyfriend/girlfriend, or with their wife/husband you can make a party, you can go run, walk with your dog or just take a walk yo relax your brain and refletionate and to forget about all your problems for just a moment and I think parks are place that we have to take care of because thats where are the home of some birds animals and plants to grow.

There this program called ""Older students assist younger students"" . What I think on this program that pairs older students with younger students is important because the students that are older already learned about what the younger students are learning about so they give out ways on how they learned it and show it to the younger students . Another reason why this program that older students assist younger students is good and important because a older student can also get more information from what a younger student already knows and not a older student. This program is not only good and important but it also helps out any age ,in other words this program can help anybody out when help is needed. You can help out anybody and they will see you as there role model for showing them the good things you should do and what comes out of it from the good descion you did. Having a negative mind wont get you nowhere in live so that is why older students help around younger students because the younger students are young and still dont know what they plan on being in the future. Not everybody has a role model because they have there own plans in the future or because they just dont want to do what everybody does as a living but when they get some help from a older person who already knows what they are doing the younger students start to wake up notice that you got to do what you got to do in order for you to get where you want to be. The only thing is that only some schools have this program and it sucks becuase there is some people who want help or need assist from someone who has already been what there going thru so if you have this program use it wisley and dont take it for granted. everybody in the world can get the help they need so they can be someone in life so that is why they have that program were older students help out younger students so the younger students wont make error mistakes in there future life. What would you do if you had this program and how would you use it in the furture of yours? I 100% this prgoram is a good idea.

When i read this statement I see that saying because you cant give up you got to keep trying to get what you want. Second, With the statement saying ""success consitts of going from failture to failture I agree with just for the smiple fact that In life you will go through some rough times and you may not always succeed In what you are trying to do or accomplish, because someone will always fail at something they are trying to accomplish but will keep trying because at some point they will complete what they had tried to accomplish the whole time. Last, Someone cant lose hope of trying to complete something because they will complete it. They have to stay motivated to keep on going and keep on going to complete it. Everyone will be successful but If someone just gives up and doesnt keep trying then they wont get what they wanted to accomplish.

Work in group also have benefit to, is more easy and more fast because all student do one part of the work, another benefit is if a student dont undertand the work the other student can help to explain, in this form all students understand the work, the mayority of the students prefer to work in group because is more easy and sometimes a student dont work and all the rest of the group do all the work.

Both have benefits but I think that the best option is to work alone also because is better for the student start to work alone, for the teachers the best option is the same, the students work alone because in this form they can learn more about the student in how they work and how they think, the teachers can see the capacity of each student because not all the students work the same in this process help to all the teachers learn more about all students.",6,4,5,5,4,5,2681,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

181,3378,A81E2C81BCAB,"In my opinion, i think what Albert Einstein is saying, might be true. I think imagination is like a little world in your mind that only you can control. Imagination is what you want it to be, nobody can control it because its yours to keep and think about in your mind. I agree with Albert Einsteins quote,""Imagination is more important than knowledge."" I agree with this quote because, knowledge is building up in your mind little by little because people are teaching it to you. Even though knowledge is going to be extremely helpful in the career you desire to have, you must have imagination in order to ""look"" into the future and see yourself doing something good with your life. Einstein was one of the smartest human beings on earth known to man kind. He was the creator of the space and time theories that in my opinion, I like very much. Albert Einstein had to use imagination and knowledge at the same time in order to come up with those theories. He also needed knowledge in order to know what was out there in deep space and to know the truth behind black holes and all that cool\space stuff. Imagination is a real thing. Imagination is better than knowledge because its there with you forever. Knowledge is taught to you, but what is taught to you, you might forget it in the future. Also things that you learn in life might not be used in the future or in the career you fore seek to be doing. Even though knowledge is really important to learn, it may go away or you might not need it in the future career or job you wish to do. Life is full of bad people. If you have ever done something wrong, you might want to ""think before you act."" If you were to do something without knowing the consequences, youre going to get in trouble. What if bad people that are in jail right now, wouldve thought of the consequences before committing the crime? Yea, they probably wouldnt of done it. Example, if you wanted to prank a teacher on the last day of school or hitting a school clock, causing it to fall and break, you might want to think before you act.

Simple, not everybody has the same capacity, as somebody said ""we can not judge a fish by his ability to claim a tree"", we must motive the student to take the class that he/she wants and they will give their best. thanks for the attention, in addition, I hope that the principal could take a smart choice and leave the classes electives.",6,5,7,7,7,6,3260,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
183,2276,18FDAA0BF6A2,"Do you think students in high school, should commit a career at a young age? I think students should wait until there last year or second to last year of high school, to think about getting a career. Students in high school should focus more on school rather than a career. But they can think about what they wanna do after high school. Do you think by the time students enter high school, They are expected to identify a career? I think that students who are about to enter high school. Should focus on school and than getting out of high school. High school is not a joke it matters. You have to pass your classes in order to go to the next grade. If you fail some classes you repeat those classes again the next year or have to go to summer school. You dont wanna go to summer school. I wouldnt wanna have to go to summer school just because I didnt pass the first time. When kids enter high school, should they think about a career? I think they should take electives that relate to a career. like fun electives they can take during the school year. I think that high school is getting us prepared for the real world kinda. Because once we leave high school we are on our own. Noone is gonna help you besides your family and friends. Thats why I suggest getting a job so you can take care of yourself. I think students thinking about a career, before going to high school. Should focus on school because high school isnt a joke. Of Course high school has drama but we have to deal with and its not that hard. I think kids could brain storm about getting a career at a young age. High school isnt easy we all have our problems we have to deal with. But high school is temporary just like pain is temporary when your dealing with depression. High school in general sucks sometimes because of the drama and high school girls. The teachers arent like middle school and elementary school teachers. The teachers in high school arent gonna hold ur hand. So thats why you gotta work and not slack off in high school because itll come back to bite you.

They arent dependent on other people when it comes to most things in life and know what to do to get past certain things. These people grow a lot mentally because they end up knowing a lot because they go through with the decisions themselves; they dont listen to other people and dont make their decisions based on what other people say. Self-Reliant people know how to get through their important or ""life changing"" decisions. For Example: Buying your own house, getting married , and dropping out of school are all very important decisions that you and only you can make. They think through about what decision they are going to make. People that dont make their decisions on their own always depend on someone or something else, especially when they are very important. You can learn a lot from making important decisions by yourself and it can help you in the long run. Self-Reliant people arent dependent on other people and always follow their instincts. They know making your own decisions is better than being guided towards what decision to make. Being Independent also goes in the same category as making your own decision. You do everything by yourself when you are independent, all the decisions youve made has either had positives or negatives for your life, asking someone for their opinion is only going to make you more biased to that choice. People should make their own decisions based on what they want/need to do for their life. Making your own decisions helps you grow mentally, every major decision youve made affects your life every day. Most people always seem to ask somebody for help on a very important decision, while others just think about what they should do themselves.

These are all the reasons why i agree with waht he wrote and why i agree with him like i said you ned to try to bigger things in life and become more succesful and get more better things have what you want like buy a car a house and go on vaction with your famliy and like i said for reason two i said if you try and make a mistake you need keep on trying and become a better person. so that is what i think about what he wrote and why i agree with him.

Some activities you can do is play sports, practice sports, run laps, and do exercise. I think that some people find outdoor activities enjoyable, because they can do activities with others and enjoy the weather while doing activities. People should go outdoors more, because if they dont go outdoors and dont do activities, there is a chance that later on in life they can have weak bones. There are people who stay indoors just listening to music, but you can actually go outside and do activities while listening to music. If you dont like to play sports, exercise, or run laps you can just ride your bike.

First,some students wanna to stay home for classes this is good thing because you can fouces carfully and take you time and no body cant make you obsess. Some students maybe just need focuse to classes and he cant do in schools and he want to be school home. For Example; We have firend family him name is Generic_Name,Generic_Name wanted to be home school and do work in home. He do like to come school early. He told to him Mother and Father but they are is not agree with him because they says you have to go school and you can learning better and he do not have any option and he start to go school. Second,the student want to stay home school they should know home school make your lazy because you dont have any activity to do you you stay home all time. For friendship you cant find good friend. this is make you unfriendly. for the class maybe you not understand what teachers means and you have some question. For Example;Generic_Name she is school home and she all time in home she doesnt have any friend she talk with her mother and father and her mother father is agree with she and she start to go school and she find alot friend and she understand better then befor. Lastly,some teachers like to teach online and I think this is good option to for teachers because maybe teachers can teach better and maybe can foucse better then in class.

For Example;Generic_Name every Thusday have teacher she come every Thusday in Generic_Name home and she was help to Generic_Name to all home work. she talk to Generic_Name about home teacher is good then teacher in school because you focuse just for one student but in school you focuse just for maybe twenty students this is to hardc for me.

When they talk to each other they can learn more about the other person like they can know what they like or what they dont like. So they can learn a lot from each other. It mean that when you make friend it can help the smaller kids. It can help the smaller kid because they can uderstand better about the lesson because they know then if they dont understand something someone is gonna to help them to understand. They can say their opinion because ththe older and smaller student do not have a lot of different age like could have 4 or 5 years old more then tem so that is not a lot, so it can be easyer to the small kid to explain you what their opinion is. They can also ask a question when they want because sormely they have to wait that the teacher is finish an other student to ask the question but if there are also older student which alredy do the lesso you can ask them your question. The work by different age help the small kid but it can also help the old kid. It can help the old kid because it help them to stay calm to do not be in stress, because with small kid you have to dpeak slow and do not be angry because they do not understand you are saying.

190,287,444D784C5791,"Having the benefit to work alone or in groups is a good thing. Some say that working alone is much better than working in groups because you get no distraction, you also have more advantage to get more work done on time, and get more time to actually think about your answers and not having to worry about someone telling you different, if your wrong or right. When working in a group, you always end up doing all the work yourself or someone else copying the answer from your work becasue they didnt wanna work do their part of the work. Working in groups is not always a bad idea but when you end up doing the work yourself then it is. We sometime wanna work with people we hang out with, but in the end you never get work done. Someone is always doing all the work and thats when everybody copys from that persons work, when they finshed the work. To start off, working alone can cause you less distractions and it would also help you concentrate more on your work. For example, my phone brings down a lot of distraction to me, so therefore I put down my phone for a while and concentrate more on doing my work instread of being distracted on my phone and not getting any work done. Thats why have less distractions and being concentrated more could get you to finsh more work on time. Second of all, you also would get more advantage of getting work done on time. You would take your time to actually do the work instead of guessing or rushing to get done first. For instance, if you were working with a group, you would barely get any work done, but if you work alone you could get more work done than what the group would get done. Lastly, you could actually think about your answers and why you choose that answer choice. For instance, if you were working in a group yall wouldnt talk or think about the answer choice, yall would just guess for every question so yll would be the first ones to be done. When you work alone its different, you take your time, look over your answer choices and double check to see if thats the correct answer. In conclusion, these are the benifits for working alone and not wokring with groups, working alone is so much peaceful and easier then having to work with a group and rush your work and guessing on every question. Having to concentrate therefore less distractions, also having more time to actually get work done and lastly looking over your answer choices carefully.",8,8,7,8,7,8,886,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

192,3629,FEAF4F517583,"To begin with, there are different opinions about to do something beyond of what we have already mastered and for that reason we will never grow. Some people idea is that if they have already their master they will stop there, but thats not the point. I believe that we have to keep trying and learning until the end ; for example, if you never try something different you will never grow. Im agree with author Ralph Emerson and here are my reasons why: One reason, is you will have more experience. Experience make people rich and I am not talking about profit. For example, if I go to apply for a job and I just have a high school diploma because all I wanted was a high school diploma, but there is another applicant that have more than a high school diploma he also have a diploma as a plumber. This applicant have more experience and more masters, he prepared himself more than me , so he will get the job. Sometimes in life we have to be ambitious in a property way. I am agree with author Ralph because learning differently means growing. The reason is I will be more mature, for example ; I will gain more mature because I have learned based of my mistakes, moreover will be easier for me than another person that just stayed with the easiest. There are many people that give up at the first try; although, life is not easy but at least dont give up at: the first, second and the third try. Another reason why trying something new of what I already have is I can reach more goals; in other words, at this time in society your value depends a lot on what you have, you can more privileges if you have more goals earned. For example, my goal is to be a police officer but after I reach my goal I will keep looking for a highest range, and that will make me grow: economically, physical and mentally. In addition, while you are mastering new goals you will be growing at the same time. In conclusion many people is not agree to this idea because many of them like the easier, but the easier is not valuable .There will be many obstacles, and people will think that is the end; consequently, they will not grow sufficiently to know that the most they try the most opportunities of gain they have. However, in my opinion is never late to continue learning because; The more we learn that more we know, and the more we know the more we grow.",7,6,6,6,6,7,3880,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

In my personal opinion I want to be the good one; to make it happen I have to show the best of me at the first time. It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change, I think that it is true. There is no second impression, once is enough to show the kind of person that you are. There are three reasons why I agree. I will not be the person that no one would like to believe in, I will not get help from anyone, and I will not have friends. To begin with, I will become the person that no one would like to believe in. For example, if I show myself as a liar at the first impression, everyone will know that I am not the one or the incorrect person to believe in. Even though I am saying the truth no one would trust me, but the first impression can change it. My mom told me that doing the best since the begining will help me the rest of my life. She was right because of what she thought me, and I apply it in my life I see myself as the person who you can believe in. Secondly, I will not get help from anyone. In my life I will need help from others because I am not able to do everything by myself. Thats why I should make people to see me as a helpful person at the first impression, otherwise I will not get help. I heard someone said that ""what I give to others is what I will recieve back from them"". What I understood is that if I do not help others, they will not help me. I always like to be the kind of person that help without waiting something back. I think that it makes my impression as a good one. Finally, I could lose friends or I would not have any friends what is even worst. Since the first time when I met my friends and showed them that I am the type of person or friend that is always with them no matter what. Furthermore, I have never betreyed one of them but if Ive would did it when we met, they already kick me out of their life. As I said before one of the things that can make me the best friend is my first impression, show them that I am loyal. In conclusion, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, you can change them but it takes a long time and you will lost your patience waintig until it change.

"" I agree, because when a problem is present you have a chance to learn a lesson, new things and methods to solve it. When a problem is present you have an opportunity to learn a lesson and keep trying to solve the problem until you find the answer to it. When you have a problem you can also learn new things like what is it that is making the problem, what it is affecting, and whom is it affecting. When you have a certain problem you can also learn other methods to solve it like how and who made the problem, how can you solve the problem, and what plan you can use to solve it. For example you are facing a bigger problem that you have ever faced before and when you finale solve it you have learned a new lesson, method, and two or more new thing about how you can,may or will solve your future problems even if they are tougher than the ones you ever faced before because the bigger you get, the bigger your problems become. For another example, imagine yourself as a detective in a homicide case, you are facing the problem of learning new evidence and using new methods, while using the lessons and new thing you have learned while were investigating the crime scene. You have to use all of those tactics to find the corporate, because all you need is to use the lessons you have learned while you are learning a new one, learning two or more new things, and having a method to capture the corporate (criminal).

196,2634,2F3210D23414,"Students now can take classes from their houses. Schools are offering students the possibility to take classes online from their houses, I think is a excellent idea because sometimes students dont have the possibility on getting a ride to get to school, or it makes it easier for students that have to stay home for personal reasons, or even if you want to take a class during the summer to get more credits and get to graduate earlier. Sometimes students do not have the possibility on getting rides to school and the county do not offer them a bus transportation system that can take them to school, for example in my country Costa Rica there is not a free transportation system to get to school and the only transportation system is the public one and you will have to pay for it, its an excellent idea from the schools to have this kind of classes that you can take from your own house. Some students have reasons that make them stay home, such as girls being pregnant, students taking care of their parents that need people to take care of them because they are sick or have any disability and they can not stay home alone, in those cases students can finish their school courses at home and take care of their loved ones at the same time.

Churchills statement bring a beautiful statement of what successful can be signify in our life, so success its something what everyone can obtain in any situation, however, its the most wonderful opportunity for our own willingness,while, in my other hand failure means practice of our own future, because failure its just the perfect manner to learn, to be better with the past of the time. How your going to teach your childrens, if you didnt make mistakes? Failure make people with experience, ""if you dont make mistakes,you dont learn"" and you cant teach other people, when they are in warning to make the same mistakes that you did before, this is a great example of family, so you need to be the example of your childrens helping to show the danger, but as well the wonderful manner to see the failure with enthusiasm to commence again. The failure make better people? absolutely, because mistakes sample the things what we didnt wanted to see before; failure to failure probably its tired, but have a great recompense; failure prepare our own life, for example if we failure the test, probably next time we are going to study better than the first time, but we get a great experience to see with better perspective than before. The point of failure is what we need to live failure in our own life, for understand and see with different perspective than before, failure create a maturity person with experience, and big knowledge;however this great statement its a example of persevered,progress, and growth in our own life to get experience, maturity, productivity, and fortress. My conclusion is basically in the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success, so make mistakes is no bad its part of life, just dont give up and show that we can be better, we can do better than before;failure is the teacher of your future, dont be fear on what people can be say about your decisions, or you manner of see your failure, its fine make mistakes ""we learn something new"",but its important the manner that we see it, with enthusiasm or sadness?,because we continue,we start again,and we can get better results. Failure its the experience of the teacher, of a persevering, progressing, and productivity person,life its not perfect, but depends the perspective in what way do you see life, so"" we need to make mistakes to be the teacher of the tomorrow"".",7,5,7,6,6,6,3114,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

I think in my opinion students should do that and work from home , for example if one day you are feeling sick but you want to attend school and get all your work done that will be one method . Another example will be if you are out of town and you still need to get work your done , the perfect way will be doing it online. Lets say if I wanna study at home and do my work it will be better I will get my work done , wouldnt be distracting at all and feel much conformable in my opinion others might think it is better to go to school. I honestly feel much better doing work at home then being school, if you need help or anything just email the teacher. Another example will be getting to do all the work from doing it in bed but yet still doing your work from home should be an option or be required .

199,3870,E926BE6F104E,"Working in a group can be helpful. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time. Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince Id rather work alone. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldnt have been blamed for. So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. But thats a whole different story. At the end of the day i will rather choose to work alone than in a group but some might think otherwise.",7,8,7,8,8,8,3389,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

It is important because we need to show that we care for our community and world. Some people say that it is a waist of time to be helping the community and the world they think that thats why their are people to work and take the trash out and stuff like that. But we cant leave other people that work all day and all week when they are tiered and want to rest to be picking our left overs!! Some people are eating at the park, mall, store, etc. and they think that when they are eating they could just through their rappers and some food on the ground and not pick it up they live it their so others can pick it up for them and i think that is WRONG!!! The people that have food, drinks, etc. and are eating any were they should throw their trash in the trash cans when they are done eating their food. And i think if we pass by trash being in the floor we should pick it up because to be honest i dont think another person would pick it up but they should. We dont want our community/world to be dirty and stinky with trash all over the place. We want our world to be clean and with nice fresh air that we could breathe with NO problem. Thats why i want to join in the community service group to help our community /world be a better place for other people and us even if others dont want to help but i think that every one should be in the community service group and help the community.

I think soccer is a fun activity to play, because you can learn how to work in teams . In my opinion it helps you improve your friendly skills. Soccer helps you on how to work in teams. Ive seen some famous soccer players on TV play. At first when they join a team they dont get along with the rest. But when time goes by they start working as a team. It helps them talk to others and work as one team. Also, when you play soccer you have to think what youre going to do next. So soccer helps you improve your thinking skills. Most people are not good at thinking fast. It would be helpful for them to play soccer. It can help you think of new ideas. maybe in an emergency it might help you think faster on what to do. it can also help you develop new ideas. It makes you pick the best choices you have and what to do with them. Playing a sport its going to help you in the future, even if you think its not. Finally, soccer is a fun sport to play, because it helps you run around and exercise. It can help you stay healthy and stay in shape. Nowadays people dont like to play sports. They just be in their house watching TV shows,playing video games, or just doing nothing. People focus too much on the internet that they forget how to play sports and do fun stuff. I think that people should go outside and try something new while you can. Some people regret not playing any sports when they were younger.

204,3876,583DC3D2E7FC,"I think that people who graduate a year early to go into the workforce, or start college early isnt a good idea or decision. People end up missing out on a lot of High school experiences. High school should be about making memories and making the best out of the four years they have left. Having time to be focusing on deciding what kind of career they want to have in the future. High school gets people ready for deciding about what they want to be when they grow up. People who finish High school early might not be 100% sure on what they want to do or what they want to be. Also, having to take summer courses and classes takes away from having a summer and enjoying it. Spending time with family and friends, traveling. Although people have the ability to finish early youd end up missing summer and always working on classes,doing projects,doing homework,or extra credit assignments,etc. Even though most people who finish early have a lot of pressure on them to try and get the most work done so they can finish early. It could get stressful because theyre studying for exams and trying to stay on top of their grades and assignments. I think its better to have the full 4 years of high school because you would have more time to do things like sports, clubs,etc. Being apart of a team. Going to games and competitions. Going to powder puff home, football games, etc. Also if youre apart of a club like Photography,choir,film, or any club they would be able to make a lot more memories and have time. Especially During their last year of high school. Missing out on senior events, senior class trips,having fun being a senior. Having Senior privileges, early release, late arrival, Eating at lunch in the senior patio. Having senior class trips, Graduating. finishing all your assignments and getting out of school a month early. Getting senior class rings, having memories of getting ready the day or night of graduation. During your senior year since your almost done with High school you get to have less classes because you have all your credits. In conclusion i think its best if people dont graduate early because theyd miss out on the full 4 years high school experience. Being able to make memories with friends, meeting new people throughout the 4 years. Participating in school clubs and sports teams. Making the most out of high school events like homecoming, and prom. I believe its better and easier to graduate after the four years.

205,2619,F4EA60BCBC2C,"Many people prefer to work in a group, because they think it can be more helpful, and others people said that they prefer to work alone. There are some benefits of working in a group and working alone. I think that the best option is to work in a group. When you work in a group you can finish faster. For example, if there is a group of three people, one people can be doing a job, while you are doing an other, and the third people can be doing an other. That is a smart and easy way to finish the work faster. Working in the group can be very helpful for planing how to do a project. Like as, all the people in the group gives their opinion of how to do the project and everyone in the group hears the ideas and them, they vote for the best idea in the group. That is a key point of working in the group everyone express them self and the work become easily. In a group you can have better ideas. For example, you are in a group, and you have an idea and you tell the idea to the group, all the people in the group is going to give an opinion, and they will tell you if your idea is good or it is bad. In that way you can have more ideas for you and your group, and your group and you can learn more from your ideas. Working in a group can be more helpful, because you and all the people in the group can have more ideas and finish faster. Even thought some people prefer to work alone, because they think that they can be more concentrate and they can learn faster. In conclusion in a group you can finish faster and have more ideas for you and your group. While working alone you can concentrate more because you have less talking, and you are less distracting,when you work alone you can learn more, because you find the answer at your own.

206,752,12E3D52345C6,"Technology has always acted as a compelling and mysterious field for me. Even as a child, I spent countless hours not playing my video-game consoles as intended, but rather meticulously studying every component of the device in an attempt to crack the mystery on how it operated. Despite the fact that Ive grown older and many aspects of my life have changed, my passion for technology has not only remained, but undoubtedly grown stronger as well. Therefore, an internship in this field seems vital in feeding and nurturing this passion. Although I have not had previous experience in shadowing, an opportunity to shadow would be fitting due to my previous experience and ever-growing passion in this field. My experience in the technological field proves fitting for this opportunity to shadow. In school, I am enrolled in the Center for Information Technology at Generic_School. This specialty center provides me with crucial access to exclusive technology-based courses and teachers that help me broaden my vision in the technology field. Classes such as IT Project Management, Programming, and AP Computer Science Principles are all courses that I have been graciously provided with through the center and received exceptional results in. This daily involvement in technology not only increased my knowledge in this field, but also my curiosity on the subject. Outside of school, I am a member of the Technology Student Association, a club dedicated to assisting students nurture their interests through rigorous competitions. Through this club I have been able to surround myself with peers with similar interests and aspirations. This club has also provided me with opportunities to exhibit my knowledge in the technological field through competitions, receiving first place in States in Mass Production, Junior Solar Sprint, and Biotechnology. My involvement and superior results in these events prove to show not only my interest in this field, but my capabilities as well. These experiences transfer directly over to the internship, allowing for a smooth transition without much confusion. The passion I have for technology undeniably proves me to be fitting for this internship opportunity. A crucial action that proves my strong interest in technology occurred when high school specialty center results were published. I was accepted into the medical, IB, and the information technology centers. Despite the fact that the majority of my close friends chose to enroll into the medical center, I stuck with my passion and enrolled into the Information Technology center. The action of choosing my interest over my close friends of many years displays how much I value technology and wish to pursue it in the future. In addition, my strong passion for technology can be displayed through the utilization of my free time. While other kids may choose to spend this time by indulging themselves into video games, much of my time is spent educating myself on technology. Many enjoyable hours of activities such as reading on the history of computers or watching videos on the future of technology were spent during this time. This use of my limited free time shows that technology, in my mind, is not a merely a class in school, but rather a hobby or an enjoyable subject. This attitude would no doubt have a beneficial effect for the internship. In conclusion, the heavy interest and years of experience I have in technology proves me to be exceptional candidate for this shadowing opportunity. Although my work experience is limited, my passion and expierence in technology may help me ease into the internship without trouble. The talent I have in technology mixed with the catalyst that is my preexisting passion for this field helps me understand the importance of this internship. Not only will this internship assist in broadening my horizons on technology, but it will also help nurture and grow this passion into something meaningful and of use to the real world. Therefore, I believe this internship is perfect for me. ",10,10,10,10,9,10,259,"conventions 10, grammar 9, phraseology 10, vocabulary 10, syntax 10, cohesion 10"

However, I work at a restaurant at the moment and I am trying to become a manager. Although, I heard you have to do a lot before you become one . I want to know how to run the prices and how to make deals because I dont have that much experience , and must know how to do that to become a manager. Furthermore, I researched your job and read the reviews your customers love your restaurant . They say it is not to expensive but not too cheap ,also they say it is worth a drive down their. Thats why I wanted to ask to if i could get some experience from you. Moreover, I wanted to know how to actually learn how to run the entire business. For instance, if i wanted to open up my own business I want knowledge from an expert before I do. My school does not have the right experience that you have . Also, I had spoke to one of my classmates they told me that you do training classes for students that are very interested in business she applied and she told me that she got really far in her business and that she is already getting started. I wanted to apply for the training so I have a clue on what is going on so I can eventually start my own restaurant. Lastly, I wanted to know how to manage people around , know how to be a right trainer for a perfect restaurant. Nevertheless, people say it is hard opening up a business if you dont have the right training . For example, I had a friend that decided to run a business without experience she did not know how to mange the line in the kitchen , the people in the front, nor the prices. Later on the business ran out of service and got shut down. However, that is not how I want to end my career . I want to go somewhere and be in a place where people will love to socialize with the waiters, and to get their orders right .Thats an important part on why I came today to experience the way of training.

First, putting more effort can help you grow of what you are good at. For example, im good at singing at church. I will put more effort so i can become better at my pitch and the tone of my voice. Putting effort on something means you want to be better at it, and also means that you will like to learn more and grow. Putting more effort can get you somewhere. What i mean by that is a better situation, a better position. There is nothing bad putting a little effort on something that you can get better at and achieve. Also , You can always be better. Being better is better then good, for example, I am good at cooking, but i can be better at cooking.

Afterall, he/she has some hobbies in his/her life like cooking, painting, designes, dancing, singing. Think, a student is only studying because he/she wants to graduate earlier than the traditional four years. What will happen next? At the point he/she will be tired of life which is absolutely unfair. Maybe she/he has a very good artist. How can he/she expose? The answer is through electives. No matter what a person works with, if he/she doesnt like to do that work, it never last longer. So, elective is a way to make student happy and cheerful. When the academics make them tired, electives help them to get out from there. Summer courses are expensive in some of the schools. Sometimes middle class family cant afford the courses fees. For this, the rich kids take the courses only. The poor kids stay behind. The poor kids cant afford the courses just because of money. Maybe they are more talented than the rich kids. They also should get that opportunity. Isnt it unfair for the poor students? Yes, it is. So, they shoudnt continue with this three years method. We should treat all the students equally. Students should enjoy the whole summer by doing outside activities. Students usually have school 9am to 5pm. They spend their whole time in the school. How can they make themselves involve with outside world? Normally they cant in the regular school days.

213,2718,AB142AA123BC,"As we all know, students love summer break. but what if they were to take that long summer break we once had and make it into a 3-4 week summer break! I would be beyond upset and I bet other students will too! Personally I dont think its a good idea. But who am I to judge other peoples opinions. So im going to just state some reasons why this not a good idea. First Reason is that many students want a long break from school. And I mean a LONG break from it. The reason to this is because, we get stressed, tired, drowsy, and even suffer from all the studying and work we do year around. And this can cause depression in teens as well, and trust me I know that feeling it sucks. But anyways back on topic. And for the educators that said we should get longer winter breaks and spring breaks it sounds like a good idea but it just doesnt make sense to me in my opinion. Second Reason is that students spend more time with family and friends! The reason for this is that students dont have time to spend time with them because there either doing school work or there to tired to even talk so they go to sleep early because of how tired they are. And when you are tired you feel grumpy and disturbed by everything so its better off just going to sleep rather than talking to family and friends because, all your going to bring is negative energy and no one wants that. Final Reason is that summer break is basically like a reward for students that made it through the year. A nice 3 months without work, stress free, relaxation, and do whatever you want and 3-4 weeks is not enough for us to be honest we need a good long break from it because we just need a little time to relax. And when September arrives it will be a fresh start and are minds will be clear and ready again too do more work. In conclusion these were my statements on why summer break should stay as it is.

And also will see that activity to be fun at the same time and will like to do it all the time. One of the activities that one can do outdoors is going to the community park to have some fun alone or with their family to enjoy the environment and leave their life the way they want to, also they can take their dog with them and have fun with them some of the activities they can be doing with the dog is training them how to jump,catch things,and also how to make friends with other dogs in the area of the park they are. and also if they go alone they can also have some alone time on their own or even make friends with other people who also brought their dogs with the,and by this they will have some fun outdoors and also find that going to the park was a fun idea. Another way to have fun or spend time outdoors is to go to the beach on your free time to clear your mind from all the things you did on workdays like from Monday to Friday,having al those kind of stuff on your shoulder at work I think that this will be the best time to go to go to the beach. But if you think that in your opinion that my first point I made about going to the beach was not the best idea then i think the second point may be the best reason why someone will have interest in going to the beach. The main reason why someone will go to the beach is to have the best time of his or her life or maybe find someone that the person is attractive to when they go to the beach.",7,6,7,5,6,6,2351,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
215,139,FF8BAC351714,"I disagree with the students attend classes form home or vidoe conferencing the reason why i diagree with this online thing is that one of are student will not get on, they will fall asleep and they will not do there work the by them doin gthis alot of kids can fail reason why i say this things because i know students im am one; that me explain to you why I say this . The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone . Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them. Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart. However other migth say the students attend classes form home is the best thing they can do because they dont need to do all that monring things they can just open the laptop and join there teacher form the web cam and learn but other cant learn like that they need someone rigth next to them so the students can understand more better.

216,1735,D7C9E22CC216,"Graduating Early is a Bad Idea Personally I think graduating in three years instead of the traditional four years should not be allowed. School should really think about this idea before making it an actual thing, because for some students this could be a good thing, but for some students this could be really bad. Graduating early to me is a bad idea because, I dont think it gives students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to learn while being in high school. In high school students go through situations, make mistakes and bad decisions, learn how to fix those things and not do them again. Students find what they really like to do in life while being in high school but some students need a lot of time to find out what is that thing that they love and want to do for the rest of their lives. Students that play sports need to play for a good amount of time to get better at it and maybe get an scholarship, students that take mechanic courses or photography courses need a good amount of time to learn about everything they need to dominate on whatever they do, so that way colleges can come to their school, watch them and find out if they deserve a scholarship or not. While being in high school, students learn how to adapt to new environments, new people and even different languages so that way when they go to college they are ready for anything. Students that do want to follow this plan and graduate a year early, are going to have to go to school during the summers or in the evinings, if students do that then they wont be able to get a job and work what being in hish school and they wont be able to learn to manage their money and to figure out whats good or bad for them economically. I have a friend her name is Generic_Name, she graduated a year early because she took online classes and stayed after school to graduate a year early. Generic_Name goes to college and has trouble adapting to the new environment and dealing with defferent types of people, Generic_Name is having emotional pronlems because she is not sure anymore about what she wants to do in life. Generic_Name and I talk everyday and she tells me about everything she goes through, she tells me she cant get a boyfriend because she doesnt know how to maintain a healthy relationship, she tells me shes having economical problems because shes doesnt know how to manage her money because while being in high school she worried more about getting her credits than actually learning what she had to learn to be ready to the real world. In conclusion I think is a bad idea for schools to allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years of high school. Give students the right amount of time to learn everything they need to be ready for the real world. ",8,7,7,8,8,7,3013,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
217,3256,EEE6067CF9B5,Some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. If they dont know how to somethings in school or out side of school. Or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. For older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. And can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. Challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. School program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. Might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. And have good jobs later in there lives and I think that more kids should have this. Chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. Because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they cant that why there are the older student. That can them help he or she with the home work or projects. They can help one and other to finish faster and get their projects done if they wish to or they can just work on it just by them self. and then when most of the kids are done with homework witch most wont be they might go on there computers or they can go outside and play some outside games witch so half would go out side and the other will stay to keep this program fun and not just doing homework and classwork all day long. So they can keep or gain some energy to when they are done form playing they can comeback inside with some.

218,64,ED9C6EDC5601,"Adding another hour and thirty minutes to the school schedule is just a waste of time! It means having to miss time with my family. It also means having to wake up earlier to get to school. Teachers would have to stay back and work longer but probably get paid the same amount for ten hours. So I disagree with having to add another hour and thirty minutes. First of all I dont think kids would like to wake up extra early and get ready for school. Once the students get to the school they would be half asleep and it would be harder for them to focus. The students would have trouble staying awake and they would have more attitude then what they have now. More students would be marked tardy and there would more students skipping classes just to get some sleep. Not every student would stay awake through out the day and finish there work. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would also have an impact on teachers. They already have to wake up extra early in order to be here on time and stay late to work on grading papers, going to meetings, etc. It would be harder for them to stay awake and teach. Teachers dont even get paid enough. So why would they want to stay back and serve more time. Some after school activities would get canceled and student that would need those after school activities would get mad. Complaints would start coming in and parents would get mad and ask why their child is failing. Some sports would be canceled and and athletes would get frustrated because they wont be motivated or asked to go to a certain collage. Students would get low grades if after school activities were to get canceled. The school would become a laughing stock. Adding an hour and thirty minutes would have a bad effect on the school and the people in it. There would be more trouble then there is now and students wouldnt get motivated. Grade levels would go down and students wont focus. Teachers would have trouble staying up for ten hours.

Some students might not understand the home work or just cant cach up. Students in homework club can cach up or even can be finish with the unit that they are working on. Some students can be cached up a lot and help the ones that are not or the ones that cant go. For the teachers. teachers that like showing kids more education, teachers that like helping students when there stuck in a problom, tachers that can stay after school that dont have nothing to do or dose not have children. Those type on teachers can actualy enjoy after school homework clubs. teachers that actualy like there work can go because some teachers is just there to teach, leave, and get there money but some, actualy do like it they like helping when there wrong giving them corrections. Students can finish there home work early. children sometimes cant do home work at home because they might be to busy or has a lot of activitys go after school like soccer, basball, basketball, ect. Some children might be able to go to after school home work clubs if there are after school buses but cant if there wernt home work clubs they would not be able to do there homework because, when they get home they have to take care of there brothers and sisters because mom works all day or sometimes parents might get sick and need them to take care or them. But after all i think its good to have after school homework clubs to finish or get to understand if you dont.

220,3744,35CF1B2B1326,"I think, with that changing 4 days of work in a week have disadvantages and some benefits. because people will not have time to live their normal life or do work at home, they will use the same amount of energy and resources and people will not support to work many hours in a day. In addition, people have already their own routine to work, even thought if some busines try to change work days. To began, people will not have time to share with their family, also working 4 day a week for 10 hours will cause problem in your family, children in those time do not have enough responsibility to be home by their self, even thought, people will not have time to do work at home. For example; to clean their house, to go work after school and to coexists their problems or thoughts with the family. And to do other works at the end of the day. Second, working 10 hours a day they will use the same quantity of energy and resources because is the same sum of hours that all people work, if they work 8 hours a day for 5 day, even that people may use more energy, because the rest of the week people will need energy, as well to work 10 hours a day will use the same amount of resources, to make up all the works that you need to do. Lastly, people will not support working 10 hours a day, because many people have their routine to work, or some of them have problems working to many hours, another reason why people can not work 10 hours a day is that they have their own routine work, as well student in school will not support to be in class. For example many student gets bored in class juts been 8 hours in school and if we compare there will be a lot if issue with their attendance. another point is many student work to support their self, so in that occation they will not available to work and make money. To conclude, to work 10 hours a day is to hard for many people and they will try to work less hours in a day, because they can not have time to share with the family, also they can get sick for being working to many hours. even thought on this times some people worked 10 hours a day, but at the end of all that working to much can cause serious problems with your health.

221,2658,F17F4DF6095D,"In my opinion i agree honesty is the best policy sometimes, however, honesty might hurt a persons feelings because the quality of being truthfulness is the key through out life. For that reason to support my answer your being trustworthy is better than done or obtained without lying to that person. hurting them more when you lie to them then be hundred percent honest with that person. so that why i believe honesty is the best policy sometimes even if u might hurt a person feelings. First, not stealing, cheating because people will not have respect and lose trust for you. sometimes you could end up in bad situations and problems. so i feel like if you do these things i least own up to your problems by being honest by saying you did this or this happened. Also, people will say bad names to you like your all lies, your not trustworthy, and your dishonest so if you dont want anyone in this world to call you these names be honest at all times. Then, being careful and saying sorry to the things u told people that was a lie instead of being dishonest changing that honesty i say that people start thinking your real and wanna be friends with you. instead those people out there hating you and talking behind your back almost everyday. so if u do these things it could change you as what type person your now then back then and it will change how people act towards you or behind your back most of the times. Next, not hiding anything frank from people. For example, Generic_Name dating her best friend boyfriend secretly. like you dont wanna hide anything from the people you love or care for you always wanna be honest with them no matter what. you could break there hearts by not telling them somethings if the situations important that they most know. if you dont be honest life will make you feel stressful by hiding all these things your hiding from people so you do not wanna hide anything from the people u love or care for. In conclusion, no one questioned the honesty of the judges statement. so these are my main reasons to support why i agree with this old proverb says honesty is the best policy.

222,3488,99CAD0AF3560,"Is playing a sport a fun activity for students? Does it help students exercise? Does it help students get healthier? I agree that playing a sport is a fun activity to all students for many reasons. To begin with, playing a sport is a good way to be more energetic. Playing a sport can help students exercise. Students might do some warm up games, do some work outs or they can practice at home with their families. Playing a sport can also help students get healthier. Students get more energetic, eat healthy food, and get in good shape. Playing a sport can help students do better things. They could run faster, get stronger, and it can help them do better in class On the other hand, playing a sport is bad for some students. Students might get sick for being outside. If is winter and students are playing outside all day they might get sick from the cold or if is spring they might get sick from pollution. Some students might get injured. Students might break their arms or legs for playing with others students that are bigger than them. Some students might not be good at sports. Students might suck at soccer, football, or basketball and they wont play. Even though playing a sport is bad for some students, they can still play. Even though students get sick they can still play. If some students get sick they can get medicine and go back to play. Even though some students might get injured they can recover. Some students might break their legs or arms, they can wait a few weeks and go back to play. Even though some students might not be good at sports they can still learn. Some students might suck at soccer, football. or basketball with practice they can learn how to play. In conclusion, playing a sport is fun because you play with your friends, run around, or just feel the wind in your face. It helps students exercise by doing some warm up games, work outs, or practice at home with their families. It helps students get healthier by eating healthy food and get in good shape.

223,1869,07A4DAFDE5B7,"Hello, Mr: Principal. Im writing to you this letter to inform you about our responses about changing the school manu. Im a senior student in your high school. I really want to thank you about approving the idea of chenging the school manu to a new healthier and bigger one. We really appreciate that. Some of us have a bad experince about the unhealthy food and the schol old manu. one of them is PROPER_NAME he hate the spicy food and once before he tried it by mistake from the cafeteria, his stomach hurt him and he was throwing up all the day, and all of that because of the un healthy food. And also I will tell you sir about my own experince, I still remember, when I was a kid I had one of the worst days on my entire life in the middle school when I decided to eat the new spicy wings with the super hot souce, I went to the hospital and I was very sick for a long time in the home. And all of that because of the unhealthy food such as what our school used to have. Do you know sir, I used to feel unacceptable in the school, just because the food, just because I can not eat like the rest of the students. and I can not enjoy the food with them. I have never tried the school food since that day. the only case I could eat the school food is when the cafeteria have some kinds of soap, and some kind of the none spaicy food. And there is a lot of students have the same case of me, we all are sharing our healthy lunch together, you might before have seen us in the cafeteria while we are setting as a circle. But by your decision, there are more than a hundred of student will turn back to eat in the school cafeteria. We all will be enjoying the new cafeteria manu. Especially because I heard that will be a different types of milk and different type chicken and also I heard from the new chef that you brought him from one of the biggest holtes in Virginia, he told me we will have a few types of salmon fish and others fish types. In my opinion changing the school cafeteria manu was great idea to begin to keep your student health safe, especially your freshman and salphamore students. I know what im telling you about the salphamore and the freshmens student very well, because I have my youngest brother his name is Generic_Name, he is addicted to the unhealthy food with the all of this food types, like the fast food. he could eat only the fast food in his life and he would be happy, but his body would not like that. Acctually his body begun to hurt him from now, because he been so fat and he could not move or do ant effort. he eats only the fast food which is the only unhealthy food in the world. he has a problems in his body, his body hurt him because he does not eat a vegetables and he does not has ant vetimans in his body, his body is fery big but iss very weak.and that is what the un healthy food does in our boodies. that is what you sir, saved us from and saved the next students from it. absotutly the healthy food a lot cheper than the unhealthy food. also one of the good thing is the teacher also would like to eat and try the new healthy food. one of the good thing and actually its the best thing ever is that healthy food will give the student more power than the un healthy food, and also the healthy food will make them paying more attention to the classes and to what the teachers are saying. the new healthy food will be very good thing. I wish if you sir would took this decision 3 years ago, just whaen I was a freshman or when I was a salphamore that would be great if that happend. I can not stop Imagine if that happen I was going to be playing Gym all the summer and in the winter Im was going to have PE class. That was going to be very good. I wish if that happend before. But htats fine I still can enjoy the rest of this year with eating a just healthy food from our cafeteria from this new chef. I heard he will add a new typers of food from other countries like France and Egypt and Spain, and Ethiopia also. yeah that is how the school lunch should be like. Do you know Mr: principle that there are about 20 Muslim student in this school who does not eat the old manu food like the bacon and Pig. Do you know Mr: Principal, in our school there are about 50 student or more than that who are vegan, this students used to feel very bad about the old school manu because they could ot eat any food from the cafeteria for all the time they had in the school. But from now and over these students are very happy about your decision. and also the Muslims students now they are happy because they can eat the vegan food and a least they can eat the chicken and the others food. Actually I know there are a lot of student will arguement with you about your decision. but they still young to understand that, they still too young to look for thier health and the healthy food and the unhealthy food. But, acctualy they will appreciate that very well when they became adults.

It is better to be society, fight for the benefits and to be .an active person. This can change many things in peoples lives. We have to be society to not procrastinate about daily tasks. If we are always participating and if we are always involving ourselves in an event or task that is beneficial to oneself or other. It helps build a sense of standards for society and also builds up a persons attitude Accomplishing something does not always mean achieving a goal, it could also be perform regular tasks with the best benefits. They have to fight for benefits what they want and no waist any opportunity. In my case i am always an inactive person and lose a lot of opportunity along the way. The opportunities I had and i lost because i am an inactive person and thats bad. It is better to fight every day to achieve the things we want in life. With the thing that i had to past is better to fight and strive to be successful. Active person can help people reach their goals, It feel good help people and use time wisely. In this world people have big goals in order to reach these goals people need to work for them. Small action like help or participating in community people take that like a big change in society. Time is limited in a day people use this time to accomplishing they goals. Being in active person can change the world and make a difference. In conclusion it does not matter who you are but we have to be sociable. to meet the goals and have benefit with the things we want and fight for the things we want to achieve in life.

225,3729,A68AABEAAB4B,"Dear diary today in the English class my friends were saying that in sum point in life the first impressions are almost impossible to change and I asked to other people and well what I think is that they should not say that because the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good, it also can be that they dont treat everybody the same way and one person told me that they could act in a different way I thought that its a good reason of that person and I said thank you for your answer. My first reason is that the person can be in a bad moment of there life and they arent doing good because they just moved to another place far were they lived before and left there friends or family, someone in the family died, they feel lonely,for example I have been in this situation a lot of times and my situation is that I move a lot because of the places were my parents need to work and in some point they told me that we were going to move each year and I changed how I felt, I felt upset and not wanting to go to school anymore I only wanted to have fun; this year I havent moved but my parents are seeing what house to get 1 hour from here we may move in January and I dont feel good thinking about that because here in Generic_School I feel like in home they treat me good, the teachers help you if you need something or if you have a problem in or out of school they also tray to help you in any way, and another reason is that I made a lot of friends and I really dont want to leave them (the people here are great). In some reasons the people dont treat everybody the same way because each persons sometimes are treated differently by the person; it hap pend to me one time and I really didnt like it; it was one time that I went to a party and I was going to meat up with a group of friends wen I got there they didnt want to talk to me I wondered why but I got to know by a girl that sow me wanting to talk to them and it was because they told them something that I didnt even know that I did; I went to talk with the girls and explain that I did int do nothing and told them that I had a twin sister and that I didnt tel them that I had a twin and that she was the opposite to me so things got fixed and we went to party all night and to have fun. The reason that the kid gave me was that they could act in a different way because some kids are special in some part of there life; they can be aggressive or nice because they cant control there feelings sometimes or most of the time kids with a disease one of the example that he gave me is that he knew a kid and that he will help and be nice but sometimes he will be very mad and say things to the persons that he knew; he cant control his character but they were teachers that will explain what he had and they would be better and not say things about hem.

226,2178,15FD5B635B50,Did you know 67 percent of people talk to more than one person for advice. They do that because different people might have different views of the situation. Although some people experienced the situation. The advice might be useful for other people too. It can help them agree with the choice or decision they will make. One reason why some people might ask more than one person for advice is people might have different views of the situation. Some people will have an idea of what to do and some people wont. Some people might tell you to do wrong things. Some people might not know what your going through therefore they will give you bad advice. Some people will know what they are doing so they will give you good advice. Secondly why people ask more than one person is some people have experienced it or gone through it. They might know what will happen. They might know what you will see and go though during the experience because they probably gone through it. Finally why people ask more than one person is to make sure that their doing it right or successfully. To make sure that they know what they are doing. To ask their opinions to see if they are thing as you are. To see if you agree with them. They might have a lot in common with with about the situation.

I believe the world has plenty of things and places we have not yet explored, learned about or have seen before. Everywhere you go, you learn a something new about someone or something; it could be a new culture, places in the world or even a new language, but that is only if you keep doing. For example, I was born in Generic_City and when I came here for the first time everything was new to me. Starting from seeing different faces to a completely new language, I kept trying to learn more and more about the United states because that is how you keep on doing more and not stopping your learning process. When i first went to school here i was afraid and very shy, but that did not stop me from learning the language and sure i learned something new every day because there was so much to explore all around. That is why I believe that there is something new to try and learn everywhere you go. If you encourage yourself to keep doing, you would not believe all the things you can do for yourself. Which those things sometimes can help you improve yourself and the way you view different things as well. If you keep doing and learning more, you can absolutely influence others for the better. You can teach others from the mistakes you have made from trying new things and from all the experiences you have had before as well. Someone that I look up to as my role model is my older sister, because she taught me how to be the strong young women I am today. She influenced me for the better, because of what she has been through before me. One thing she taught me that was very important to me is to not give up on my goals and my mindset from the beginning. She once told me that people will doubt me no matter who they are, and one of those people was my mother. My mom taught that my sister and I would not even get to college, but here I am as a junior in high school and my sister about to graduate college. A day never went by without my sister reminding me of how strong and independent I can be if i keep trying and keep learning because the world is full of things to learn from, good or bad. My sister had to keep learning and was always trying to do something new, because she new she could influence me for the better so i could learn from her mistakes. There is always gonna be someone out there with advice for you and to influence you for the better, but if you keep learning and trying nothing is impossible. Influencing others can be very important, mostly for the younger generation. They look up to us now and it should be an honor to show them the rights from the wrongs but that is only possible if you try to have a good mindset of always wanting to be a better person and knowing what you want. Never stop trying to learn new things because there will always be something out there to learn from and to look at it from a different point of view. Accomplishing a goal can be very hard sometimes and even makes you wanna give up but that is something you should not do. If you are always doing and trying new things you can accomplish so much more than you would ever imagine you could. My goal was to learn English, go to school, and graduate all to prove my parents and my older sister i could. I accomplished part of my goals so far and that makes me feel very proud of myself because i feel like i am slowly accomplishing my goals in a short period of time. When i was younger and until now i have always liked books and that is something that helped me learn English and to improve my learning techniques in school as well. I have not yet graduated but that is a goal that i am maintaining and that i know i will accomplish soon, but the only way that will happen is if i keep doing and learning more every time i possibly can. You may have people who doubt you or who do not want to see you succeed but you should never let them control your mindset and the way you do things. A positive mindset always comes with a positive outcome, and always surround yourself with good people because we are here to make good things happen to each other. But keeping your mind open to new things will always help you learn more everyday and have new experiences too. You just need to believe in yourself and understand that there is so much more out there that you could not know about, and that it is always good to encourage yourself to go out there and try things you have never tried before. always influence others for the better and accomplish all your goals no matter how hard it can get, because at the end of the day every good thing you do will absolutely pay off later on when you least expect it or see it coming. In conclusion I believe Thomas Jeffersons quote is very true because of all the wonderful things we can learn, experiences we can have, and things we can accomplish with time if we keep on doing.",7,6,7,7,7,7,705,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

However some students are not good at every but if they do what they really love it can learning fun for students. It can also impacted students to finish their goals and became better person in the future. Some student don have that kind of privilege as some students have to all subject so they can graduate from high school to go to college. That what make some students dropping out of high school, because they think they are not smart enough or some students cant afford to pay for some school supply. I think it is a good idea for students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. First, it can make learning fun for students and they can enjoy what every career they what in future. Second, it can impacted students to go to school learn instead for skipping school making them falling their classes. Third, students should be expected to take a career that make them happy and want to do and they are also willing to do, also achieve their goals. example for students to like the idea of identify, is to prepare them college and some may not go to college and start working. Inclusion students should chose a career the like and love. If they study the career they like their be less drop out of high school. They can also be success on what ever they can achieve in life.

However the problem is that some people are avaricious, think that are better that others people and want all at the same time. The first reason is that some people are avaricious, is a bad influence for the people that want grown in the jobs, school and in the milieu family, for example my brother not finish the school, Because He like the money and He think the best solution will be leak of the school for work more and have more money. And now He say that is not good idea leave the school for money. So theys think that are better that other people, for the society cause indifference to the other people, rejection would be also bulling. I am disagree with the thought of this type of people for example, if she/he can make something grand also the other people can the major greatness is the humility. The third reason is want all at the same time, when the author talk about ""you will never grow."" Is because the knowledge of the life is not obtain things materials amount, because in this life all is vanity if you want grow start for conform with the little that you have for example, the education help for that you will be a good person with principles. The conclusion is that the life have many opportunities bad you have the option take one opportunity.

231,383,DCB1A6F255A8,"Technology is something many people use in their daily lives, I belive technology has definintly made an imppact on people over time. Phones, cell phones, laptops, tvs have all been upgrated during the past couple of years, technology can effect us in both negative and positive ways but i belive that their are more negatives than positives. One reason I belive technology has more of a negative impact is because it causes a lack of communication with friends and with family, I myself have witnessed and expirinced this. Another reason in why it would be negative is the children using technology. Children can become more obsesed with electronnics than most teenagers and adults, I have a little brother that recived an ipad as a gift from my parents whe he was only three years old, only because he wouldnt let my mother use her cell phone in peace, getting that ipad might have been the biggest mistake thats my parents could have made. My little brother (when he recived the Ipad) stopped playing with his toys, stopped watching his favorite show which was spongbob, stopped eating as much and also stopped listening to direction and became rebelious. Everytime one of the members in my family would try to talk to him it would be like he was zonned out; he just would not listen. Another negative impact this was would be that my little brother would yell when someone tried taking his Ipad away and thats when my parents knew it was a very huge problem, so they decided to put his Ipad away for a while as well as our electronics or atleast keep them out of his sight and over time I got my little brother back and my parents got their son back. Secondly, technology can distract people in many negative ways, one way is safey, you could be walking, driving, on a boat it does not matter, but if youre on your phone and not aware of your surrounding, or not paying mind to them, than you could get hurt. Their have been many reports on people getting in car accident or getting hit all because they were not paying attention, but overall their have been more incidents while driving. There are some ways that technology has also been benefial to us. Some ways that technology has been beneficial is if you work in a job that requires you to have a computer or laptop to make work easier, or having a busy work schedule that you can type into your phone and it would alert you about the things you have to get done. Another benefial way that technology has helped is shopping! eveybody loves shopping but somtimes you cant go out and do some shopping for yourself becuse maybe its been a long week and your exausted from work or youre injured, as well as having children. Children are the worst when it comes to doing things for yourself, which is why there is technology to help you out, you can do online shopping for grocieries, clothing, exc without having to leave the comfort of your own home. In conclusion, technology overall has its ups and down, there are times where it can be beneficial and there are also times where it can be a distraction but it has definetly helped in the past in many ways one really big one is hospitals, technology has saved many lives and helped alot of familys so it really depends how you use technology for it to actually be benefitial. Its not good to take advantage of it, you have to use your brain as much as you can, people depend on technology too much and thats what causes problems.

232,3773,DC77E1C50756,"My prompt is about how everyone has a skill or talent and I have to identify a talent or skill that I have and explain how I develop and use it. Well Im an Athletic girl. I play different sports during some seasons, for example when soccer season has ended. Another sport Im kinda good at is basketball. I play sports in school and outside of school. A few other things I can do is sing and dance. Im going to start with soccer. So I started playing soccer in 2018. I dont really remember my age but I do remember the year. When I started playing soccer was when I lived in Generic_City. I played there for to seasons. I played in the spring and fall seasons. When I played in the spring it was the best thing ever like Im telling you I literally fell in love with soccer at that time. My team was a good team we were called the sharks. I was number 14 and I was happy because thats the number that both of my cousins jersey numbers are. Anyways, we won a few games and lost a few ones but we always played good, we gave our best, and we gave it all. After, spring season ended I played on the fall season. Im going to say that fall season was okay it wasnt as good as spring season but I still enjoyed it. My jersey number changed in that season so then I was number 16. I havent played since 2019 ended but I will start playing again pretty soon and Im really happy and excited. Now Im going to talk about my basketball season. Last year in 7th grade I was in Generic_School and they put up the girls basketball season was coming. I was interested in it so I decided to sign up and try-out for the team. I cant lie try-outs were rough but at the end of the day I gave my best and it was fun. A few weeks later they put up the paper of the people who made it and I saw my name and I was so happy. Anyways, that season ended, then school ended, and I moved to Generic_City. School started a few months later girls basketball season started. I was happy so I sign up. I went to try-outs for the whole week. At the end of Friday which was the last day of try-outs the coach Generic_Name told the girls who made the team and who didnt and guess who made the team MEE!!!!. I was so happy my friends and I celebrated on the way out. The whole season was great, I made so many fun memories with the girls and I was just so happy. My third skill is dancing. I love to dance everyday. Like Im always dancing in the car, shower, kitchen, my room, just everywhere. I love it and I enjoy it very much. Its something that could never leave me. Im going to start taking dancing classes so Im very excited for that. One app that I always use to dance is Dubsmash it has different song that I can dance to. Im always dancing to a song in the car when a song comes up and it has beats I just be going crazy. Finally, the last thing I love to do is sing. Singing for me is just very enjoyable and calming. I sometimes get on my feelings and cry but its just because they are really good songs and I cry because Im happy or sad. I love to sing the songs of Sydney R. But my top favorite songs to sing are All of Me, Into you, Love dont Change, and How you gonna. And yeah these are all the stuff that I do as a skill or talent.

Be a person with so many mistakes but the also is going to learn from them and,you will still come back up and start trying again. If you have done so many things and you still feel like no other person is going to appreciate of the things you have done and then you feel like theres nothing that you could do that could be good enough for nobody. Dont stop trying do not ever make yourself feel like you gotta do things for other people just be great how you are with or without mistakes you could be wonderful and make yourself happy and proud of them. In life theres so many responsibilities you have to take care of and no matter what does responsibilities are you still take care of them you dont give up because if you do you wouldnt be able to go to school and becoming someone in life you wouldnt be able to to eat you wouldnt be able to work or to do many things but you stills do them because you have to and because you do become someone out of them you become a person that graduates a person that works everyday to put food in the table a person that after words its gonna be proud for they have done and that is always good enough and that you grow everyday from it. you could become a person that could afford a car with nobody asking help and you grow everyday with or without people because you are strong like that. theres another step where family comes along and you got to be able to take care of your family you got to get your family food you gotta get then clothes you gotta get them shoes you gotta get them the most important things they need and you still get your family out of any circumstances you still get up every morning to get your money and help your family or each other up and you still grow from not just growing from it but you also get to know how something people get to appreciate what you really do for them. honestly you grow of some many ways you didnt have no idea you could but you still get through it. be someone in life is about growing little things you have left out to make them bigger. Believing in yourself is always something that is gonna help you to a positive person. Making good choices in your life is another part of you not just because sometimes you learn from them or where they could take you but how you get when you learn from your bad choices and how sometimes you react and you say to your self that you just want for your self to do good things. Dont ever in your life say that your things are never worth of any tries you have made because there really are worth of every single part of your life there are step you always take. If you want to be a great person dont thought of yourself you know you could do it you could grow of it other people would love so any wonder things and person you really are. being positive of your self is the most amazing thing you could do like for example you could be positive and just be like i will pass a test or i will pass but you are just being positive that you are sure you could do it because not you only are positive of yourself you are also showing that you could believe that you can do it. being organist with your self is less stress full because you dont got worry about get so many things out of your way the same day. Happy is showing every body that no matter they think about you you dont pay any attention to them even if you have try your best to become friends and it still not even working out so you just gotta leave the person and just let it be you just gotta show the person that you did try and if for that person your friendship wasnt good enough then dont bother. Unless you really dont try at all you will never grow even if you have put your best effort your best part you will grow and become a person that others are just going to admiral you. could you really learn from life yes!! you can be aware of it but hey!! we are not perfect nobody was born perfect we can make as many mistakes we can or we could be the greats but no theres nobody perfect that could tell you that you cant do something when you know more then anybody else that you can and that you are not perfect. It doesnt matter how people make you feel at the end of the day it would only be you and your family and the effort to put on the things you want to become the best not perfect but the best.

This is one of the example: There is a men who is an entrepreneur and he have a little company,and he decide to make it more big,but he dont know if he is going to do it. If you dont try to do it you will never grow, you have to do new things for you know you will have to try something beyond of you already mastered. The way I understand this is if you dont try to do something that you already know, you will never learn a new things that you dont know,because there is not way to grow if you dont over pass your self or you dont try it and that is going to provoke that you cant advance to grow or even stock in the way you try to make to grow. Example: When I was 15 years old, the only thing I did was just studying. Although when I start to think about my future and then I figure out I have to do more than just studying, I have to choose which college Im going and work to earn money for I can pay my college and expenses I have in my house or personal,because you have to do something for you can over pass your goals or you will never grow. But some people maybe think or have different opinions about this,perhaps people say like its a lie or you cant do it because its impossible and also that is fake. Every one dont thing the same, maybe they a different point to see it,they just dont want or they have a another way to grow. The majority of people are going to say yes,because they already lived the moment that if you want to grow, you have to go beyond of the things you already know or youll never going to trust your self. My opinion is that maybe this wrote of Emerson is true and the reason why im saying this is that you have to do things new and over pass your self ,and doesnt matter if you already mastered something,if you want to grow you have to try it because you cant grow if you dont do different things that you have not idea about how you can grow and make or dominate more things that you cant believe.",5,6,6,6,4,7,298,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

Eventually, you will learn how to spend your precious time wisely. Additionally, it will lead you to good decisions. Basically solving problems is like, when you have to make a wise decision.

241,2866,AB2FD69DBACF,"""Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose think about the effects of allowing students, to have and use cell phones in the classroom. Students think that cell phone use will make easy to study and to get high grades, every teacher, students and parent are debating if they should let students use the phone during class. Cell phones can be used for good reasons like study look for information, thats right that make school easier but at the same time is a distraction for students, because cell phones not only can be use to study, they can be use to communique play video games and thats a distraction for every student. That makes everything go back works instead of going forward. also cell phones make easier for teacher to grade, now you can scan papers with phones and you can make grades for every student, but still is a distraction, am saying this because I am a student and the same happens to me, i know what it is and i think we should not use cell phones during class not even to do homework or anything relacionated with school. To not have those types of problems we should let have every student have a computer, computer are more useful to search for problems, articles, to write etc. This will make more easier school than having phones during class, school should work more on this and all this is for a better if for good of our country to have better jobs better doctors, nurses etc. I disagree on this article because cell phones are a distraction for students, i think thats why computers were made to use, to work, study, applications, papers, images and more, school should make this up and let students use a computer in class better than phone use, like i said do it for a better life, for more knowledge, to be safe and prepared for any circumstances that can show up to life.",7,6,6,6,4,5,2292,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

For example: The British naturalist John Lubbock was sophisticated person as one his characteristics traits therefore he had the right to write and read when other didnt have the choice. When John Lubbock choose to become an politician , but also a naturalist which he chose to become one. When John Lubbock wrote this prompt he took action to write it instead of be influence by others and becoming the same as them. Because if all politician were the same and influence by each other every time they would all be the same and wouldnt have made their mark. Back then I havent known a lot of British politicians that were naturalist as John Lubbock but, until now because he made his mark. People should have to make their own choices anyways because you cant work as a politician and always agree with what people say and be influence by it you have to make your own choices. In between that John Lubbock shows hes made his own choices about this and you as the reader to think about it also and makes a choice. When it come to talking about what characteristic traits we have its based on the person who decided to become whoever they want to become and control their out come in life.

244,2580,E4905D0DD050,"Working with a group would be much easy because you have less work to do by yourself also you would finish it faster. In my opinion doing it in a group is helpful by having less work for yourself. For example, doing all the work on your own would take much longer and probably wont do it right. Also Ive done projects on my own and it takes a lot of time and a lot of effort to finish it and turn it on time. Needing a group would be helpful not just for me but for everyone who is in it because by doing together we would all get a good grade. Being in a group would make make everything much easier for everyone. Doing your project wont take as longer no more because we would do it in groups. For example, doing your stuff takes to long when doing it yourself . As in doing it all together it would be much faster. Everyone would take a part to do of the project and put it all together. In a group everyone would put a part of there assignment they have done to pull in the whole project together. There was this one time we all got to pick are group to this big project about the earth we all got a part we want to do. We had to full weeks to turn it in but because we all did want was assignment to us we finish in a week and turned it in and got ""A"" for our project. In for all doing it in group would be much faster. I think by doing it in a group it really helps because you get to know your classmate more. For example, you can get to know them by talking to each other. By getting to know your its a good thing yall can all become good friends and do even more project later on. Its also good way to comutate with others in your class you havent talk to. This one time by math teacher made us to get into groups but I didnt know anyone in the class but, a girl invite me to go with hers and I did ever since that we are always in the same group together and she became my best friend.

247,2712,7E29ACA46157,"Summer vacation is a good break for the students to spend time with their family, also a good way to take a break form school and your annoying classes, to take some rest, change your mind, and think about what will you change, when you go back to school, also taking a long summer vacation will get yourself out of stress. you will be able to do other think than just memorizing stuff you dont need in a real life, thats why its not a good idea to reduce students summer break just because educators say so, we need to have some fun and start learning new stuff about the path we want to take in our life. First of all taking a long summer break will restore ourselves, it will change our personally there might be people that are devastated from getting bullied at school, some people that have stress and dont want to talk about it and need some time to think about it, some that fail the SOL,and are failing a class, and never want to repeated again, or get ready for summer school, some that need to get ready for the next school year. we need time to do all those stuff and make our life better, when we come back from summer vacation. Summer vacation also give us the opportunity to get a job and save money, two months is pretty enough to get you at least much money. Some students that take care of themselves need to have more time to get ready for the next school season, so they can buy what they need such as: school supplies,clothes, ETC..... summer vacation need to be long enough so we can spend time with our family. school is not our family but home, the only reasons most students come to school this day are to make new friends. Second think school is worthless, we dont need to go to school for that long what we need is to work hard to achieve our dream, and have some fun with life, thats all we need, and if we stay in school for a year and spend less time at home, we will not be able to communicate well with our family, this is not a good idea, there are people that went to school, and got their high school diploma, went to college for 2 years, and are still working at McDonald for few money, that means they just waste a lot of time at school this whole year and didnt get any good from it, so if we stay at school for a year, we will then spent 12 year getting educated, and still not achieve our dream, still going to have a job at a fast food restaurant. we need a longer break so we can recover form school stress and spend time with our family, school now last for 10 month and summer vacation last for 2 months and a half, so we should leave it like that. Third thing is taking off one week off spring break and fall break is really a bad idea, why because we need to have some rest and some fun. who want that, no one want a week off spring break and also a week off fall break. what, thats insane, we are going to do a year at school and get only a total of 1 months off out of 12 months what, no, that is a bad idea, if we get a year of school , how are we going to get 3 week or 4 week of summer vacation there will be no summer vacation. School start in September and finish in June so, when we will have a year of school we will be finishing in August that make 12 months of school, so where is the summer vacation break. so some people might disagree with me, but i think that what we should do is change the school system. so lets say some students like school and want to get to the higher level. im sure that they have families and have to rest. for example; lets take a place of a student that want to be a athlete, and is learning math, science, economics, and other stuff for 12 years without getting any lessons from the the types of athlete he want to be, so thats kind of bad and not good, why because getting educated for something you dont have any interest in or you dont like at all, its not good. we can say math might help you a bit, but not everybody want the same things, also not getting a long break will weaken our brain. Every country have the same system break as us, not all but at least FRANCE has the same as the U.S, by changing our break time it might affect other countries, students will have more stress and will not have fun at home with their family, parent might also complain about changing the break and going to school for a year, by the way every time we come for a new school season we learn new things and different things, At least half of what we learn just come in some of the topic, we will not have the same class as last school season, but new one and new different topic, you will only have the same stuff to learn, if you fail the class or if you the SOL in that class, and thats why we need a longer break so we can focus more on that in the break time and wont fail no more next school season. Family over school, family is the most important thing, im dont know anyone that dont like his families members, so lets said that we should not reduce the school break, or go to school for one year, we should also change the school system so we can put students in what they are trying to become the future they want to build, the future might need more people that could do a lot of different stuff, we might need help for, then lets agree that going to school for one year is not worth it for some students and reducing the summer vacation is a bad idea.",6,7,6,7,5,6,1662,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
248,2847,49718724CB84,"Does the people that have mastered something can grow, even if they do not try nothing else? Some people believe they are very okay only with what they have mastered. People knows they could master one profession, but they also know they wont grow in nothing else if they do not try nothing else. If someone decides to only master in one thing that is okay, but that persons knowledge will only increase on what he master, nothing else. People cannot grow if their mindset is stuck with what they mastered and they wont increase in knowledge. People cannot grow more if they stick only with what they mastered. For example, Ms. Generic_Name, a really good looking woman, had a store for plants and she also teaches about plants. One day Ms. Generic_Name had to let some kids know that the plants do not grow by itself, people make them grow. She called the kids to the back of the store to show them apples seed. Ms. Generic_Name told the kids that she used to take care of them but she stopped, because she thought that once the plants grow enough, she would not have to deal with that again. She saw the plant standing and she thought her work was done. She did not take care of her plants no more because she thought they were okay in that position, but she did not know that the plants were not gonna grow more. That is exactly what happen with people that mastered something and they just stick with that, they did not try nothing else and now they are just steady they cant grow no more. Thus, if people believe they are okay with what they mastered and they dont try nothing else, they wont grow no more. Knowledge is one of the things that mostly deals with growth. For example, Ms. Generic_Name had the knowledge of every plant. At first Ms. Generic_Name did not know that she had to take care of them, at least until they could be strong enough. Now that she have years on plants she knows a lot. She did not want to stick with what she knew and now she is grown in knowledge. She is in college studying more about different types of plants from other countries. Thank to her enthusiasm for plants, Estency Generic_Name is now one of the biggest specialist on plants in the world. Nobody should be comfortable with knowing just what they want to know, people should start seeking more for knowledge based on what they want, just as Ms. Generic_Name did. Some people may say that people could grow if they have mastered only once, because they only need whatever they have passion for, or whatever they want to do. For example,Generic_Name went to college with the dream of being a constructor and he graduated from college, now he is a constructor but not how he wanted to. Generic_Name could have being an architect but he decided to be less; however, people should seek for knowledge and not only stick with one master. People could get master at something but after that people have to be open to learn knew things every day. In conclusion, people will never grow if they do not try out. A persons knowledge increase with the amount of time and interest. Knowledge is one of the things that most deals with growth. People could just get their master, but is better to always be open to learn more, ",8,6,8,7,6,7,962,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
249,597,A2EF5BCC488B,"Some people think that when they master at something theyve never mastered at, then they will grow up. That is what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson said in his quote. ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow. An example of this statement are babies starting to walk. Then they achieve at it, then they will start talking. From that point on, they will grow into toddlers where they will learn about letters, numbers, how to share with others, and some easy words to pronounce. When they get to kindergarten, they will learn about math, reading, and writing. Upon growing into teenagers, they will learn about harder math skills like harder math, reading, and they will even apply for a job. When they grow into 10th graders, they will learn about business, marketing, and learning to drive. A similar experience I had was when I was starting Automotive Technology was when I learned about how to operate tools like wrenches, ratchets, how to lift up and carry things like tires, how to use safety equipment, and how to operate electric tools like machines, impact guns, and drills. It was scary at first, but overtime, Ive been continually practicing using these tools, and now Im an expert at using these equipments. Another experience I had was when I was doing chores like cleaning, vacuuming, washing the dishes, and taking out the trash. I can do these chores without having a family member like my mom asking me to do it. Another reason why Emersons quote is correct is because if you continue practicing at something youve neve excelled at, you excel at it, then you will continue mastering at it. It will make people happy that they achieved at it. A similar experience I had was when I was in my elementary school years when I was eating dinner with my family. Back then, I used to eat a lot, and that is still true today. I would finish almost everything from meat, soup, etc. My family was impressed at how much Ive eatan. As a result, I grew so much that I was taller than most of my family members, and its still true today. I continue to eat a lot and I will eat more in my future. Another experience I had was in elementary school. In elementary school, I learned about mathematics from addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Back then, it was a little tough at first, but I kept practicing, and now I can excel at this. In contrast of Emersons quote, if people keep practicing, but they dont seem to achieve it, it might make them feel upset and defeated. However, to remedy that, if people continue practicing at something challenging, there is a higher chance that they will achieve at it. It will certainly make people joyful that they achieved it. As Emerson said in his quote, if you try your best or master at something youve never excelled at, then you will grow up and feel joyful about it. By continually practicing, you will most likely achieve at it.",6,7,8,7,8,7,2183,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Is very different have the people think is hard to take decision. if they are old they can choose what they want, they have to think very careful if they said yes they want to take class form online , is going to be more easy from them because they do not have a job or they do not have to take care, they can do it they have a lot of time in the world if they do not have any computer thats is going to be a really good problem form them because they do not have school open or they do not have the materials they want for learn, they have to look for job but sometimes if your looking for a job they need to know how you was in school they need to see you record, you are going to need in the future. If you are going to say no because we need to learn something, we do not have any money to pay to go to school theirs so many ways to go to school their have school that are free you do not need to pay anything, just you need is go to school everyday, and do not get in trouble. Is good idea if they do this in college for students they work they know, they have more responsibility. If you put a child with computer is going to be more concentrated in computer and maybe they going to have problems with their eyes or any problem when their grow up. if is a old is more easy from them because they brain is more they can understand and they do not have any issues to work in the computers. so is bad idea that they students take class form online they do not have any money or they do not work.

Because, Great Britain has,the most interesting and mysterious places to visit, the culture differences, and why is visiting Great Britain is great motivation to start learn English. Firstly, Great Britain has a lot of tourist places to visit for example, Big Ben. Big Ben is the one of the main historical places that tourist should visit first. Also, Great Britain built a lot of castles between 15th and 17th century. This castles were serving to, protect rich people or royal families from attacks, and to keep them warm. But right now most of this castles are not used to live inside because people left hem alone and nobody could keep them clean and safe. Its great place to visit to feel how people lived differently than us right now. Secondly, Great Britain believes in very interesting type culture in the world. People are living their life with optimistic view even if they have not the best time in their life. Actually, people who lives their whole life in Great Britain has beautiful accent that helps them to make a lot of dramatic operas. All of the Great Britain history, people believed in Christianity and promoted to other people, it cause that all of their old colonies are believing in Christianity. Finally, if the tourist is visiting Great Britain, its a good motivation to start learn English because, right now most of the world is using English to communicate with each other, and English is one of the greatest language to start to learn. English can be difficult sometimes but every language is difficult in some ways.

252,174,CC8C5C963660,"A study found that 87% of students that participate in extracurricular activities become more involved at school. Extracurricular activities are fun you once you let yourself try something new. Most kids judge something before trying it, but if they try it might be worth it. Most people that do extracurricular have a more happier time in school because of its positive effects. I agree that all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because students can make new friends, become more productive, and finding a passion for something new. One reason, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activity because you can make new friends. When I was kindergarten there was a healthy kids club and I was a shy kid at the time. So my parents thought it would be the best for me to join the club. I was very against but still went to the club. My neighbor joined the club too so we could be together at least. When my neighbor and I came to the first healthy kids club meeting, and we were separated into different groups. A teacher called my name to leave the room with a bunch of kids in my grade that I didnt know. After we got into the room people started talking and making new friends. This one girl named Generic_Name came up to me and we started talking. After becoming friends with her, the club wasnt that bad. Generic_Name and I started to sit by each other at lunch, and played together at recesses. We are still friends together to this very day. Another example is when my neighbor started to learn baseball. As he grew up no one else in the neighborhood knew how to play baseball. He always wished he had someone to play with. Once he got into middle school he heard they were having tryouts for the baseball team. So he decided to try out for the baseball team. He made the team. He started having more friends come over to his house. He even made friends in higher grades then him. He would always being playing baseball or out having fun with his new friends. I could tell he became a more happier person, and that he has now found people he can relate to and overall have fun with too. So this is why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because you can make new friends. Furthermore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. My cousin she decided to join volleyball team her freshman year. She thought it would be fun to join. She started to focus too much on volleyball. Her grades started slipping and she was told she couldnt play any volleyball games till her grades were up. She had to stay up late nights to complete extra work that would raise her grades. She thought to herself, if she went back to the volleyball team she would have to find a balance to make sure volleyball doesnt take over her whole life. She got her grades back on track and she was allowed to play in games again. She started getting used to her new schedule to balance volleyball, and school. My next example is when my uncle was in high school, he joined an after school club for mechanics. My uncle wasnt a very good child growing up. He was always skipping classes, and never show up to class. Soon he joined a mechanics club with his friends. He instantly fell in love with it. He started showing up for school, and teachers started to see him be more productive. He so after choose his job as a mechanic, and he started to save money to have his own mechanic shop. He soon went to college to learn more about mechanics. He started working in a mechanic shop to learn the experiences of working and owning a shop. He then started his own successful company. Without extracurricular to change his attitude about school, he wouldnt be where he is today. These are a few reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students become more productive. Therefore, I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. When I first joined band I didnt know what instrument I would be playing. I started to play the saxophone and became good at it. Once I started to show my teacher, he offered to put me in honor band and that I would need to stay after school to join it. I started to get new songs for honor band that challenged me. I knew when I grew up I wanted to play saxophone. Im in middle school and I couldnt get into band this year due to my honor classes. This year I have missed playing the saxophone because its my passion. I have decided next year to do less honor classes to see if I can get back into band and get to do my passion again. My second example is about my closest cousin. She joined her after school baking classes. She started baking cakes for family events and special occasions. She finally found out when she was older she wanted to become a baker. She is now working in at a bakery nearby my house. She is always baking and learning new techniques to improve her baking skills. This year she will be graduating high school early and going to culinary school. She never knew what her passion was going to be and without extracurricular she would have never known. These are my reasons why I agree that all students should participate in at least one extracurricular activities because students can find a passion for something new. Students making new friends, people become more productive, and find a passion for something new are reasons why I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activities. Without trying extracurricular people might never know the importance of trying something new. Overall this is why I believe extracurricular can change your life.

One other reason why i think its pretty cool, is that there is three different types of doctors, the first kind of doctor would be an Intern, which is a doctor that just started there first year as one and that is learning to be the best, another kind is a mid tern resident, which is the second to highest level, one last kind of doctor is the highest which is a resident,i think its smart that you guys have that because i think it keeps everything organized and it keeps every doctor in order. One example why i want to visit the hospital is that i want to make people that they are in good hands, that they are going to be safe, also i wanna become one of the best surgents out there, most of all i just wanna help and save lives, i think its cool that surgents get to use machines and other tools to open up people that need medical help. When i was smaller i would have to take care of my sister because my mom would be busy going to work, one day my sister got cut when she was playing outside she was bleeding a lot that i grabbed some paper and rolled it around her leg and then called my mom because it seem so deep, ever since that day i wanted to be a surgent because i didnt feel disgusted by the blood and stuff, i thought it was pretty cool that i cured her leg, and stopped it bleeding. I wanna have the opportunity to visit your hospital because i wanna save peoples lives when i grow up and have that desperate feeling when you save someones life. One reason why i want to have that feeling is because, i just wanna save peoples life and make them better, even though it might get exhausted its gonna be worth it because at the end of the day i think of how i saved someones life. Another reason is because i wanna see how the hospital works and how every gets in managed, i want to learn if there is anymore different kind of doctors for example, there is cardio heart surgery, plastic surgery and more, i wanna be a surgent when i grow up because i wanna save peoples lives, i feel like there is so much good around the world that i wanna do good when i grow up. One example is that, me being a surgent would be a good idea because i can learn and help people that are struggling in life,i wouldnt just get to help people lives inside the building, i would get to save someones life outdoor of the building too because if something happens to someone then i can help them, if i become a surgent then im gonna work hard and learn about medicine to be the best and help anyone that comes through those doors. I wanna become into a doctor/surgent because i just started watching this show and its very interesting because its about doctors saving other peoples lives and how they struggle and how that connects with there life because they feel like they havent been spending time with there friends or there family because they just have been busy of work and i feel like ive been learning on how i can not struggle in life if i do work as a surgent. I wanna visit the hospital because when i grow up i wanna become into a surgent and learn about all the medicine out there. One reason why you should let us visit the hospital would be because i wanna get the opportunity to feel to be a surgent one day and learn about everything. Another reason why you should let us visit is because if some kids are interested into becoming into a surgent then they can think of taking a medicine class in high school and learn about it more so they can prepare them self if they become into a doctor or surgent, being a surgent isnt just about opening people up and sowing them and saving peoples lives, its about learning and learning because every time you do something you have never done before in your life, you have just learned something and by getting the opportunity of just going to see the hospital and seeing how it works, i just have learned something new even though i didnt do anything other than watching. One example why you should let us visit is because we would be learning something new and getting to feel how everything works around the hospital if we were to work as a surgent or doctor. I mostly wanna become into a doctor because i think its cool how doctors are brave and work and how good they are at there jobs, mostly its cool because they learn something new everyday and at the end of the day they have saved a lot of peoples lives or changed peoples lives. A local company i would love to visit is the hospital because i feel like the hospital is very cool, the feeling of saving someones life is incredible, and you get to learn everything about medicine/medical stuff. I think working at a hospital is a gift because you get to learn and everything and save peoples lives and most of all you learn. I hope you consider thinking of letting my school visiting the hospital. sincerely, Generic_Name ",8,7,8,8,7,7,3521,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

They also show you to not repeat the past. Hard times like problems help you to keep your head up and never give up on a hard war. A problem is a chance for you to do your best. My problems opened up so many chances for me to do my best in life. Problems will always have a chance for you, so you can do better in your life. Never lose that one chance in life. Those chances will not come back and you will regret not taking the chances. I took a chance to live with my mom and now I am happy with her. Hard problems make you build up strength on yourself. When my father abandoned me and my sisters, it build up strength on me and my sisters because, we had to learn that are father is not always going to be there when we want him to be there and we have learned that we dont need a father for everthing and we can do it by ourselfs. I cant lie I really miss him and I really wish I could give him a big hug. All that is left are the good memories I made with him. I will never forget him and will always love him beause he is my father. All the tears I have cried over him have build up strength on me and thought me to never give up and keep fighting even if it is hard for me. Hard issues show you to not repeat the past and do better then the past. My hard problems have showed me to not repeat the past and to do better then the past because, I would always try to give up on everything and always put a negitive thinking to my problems. This has showed me when you try to give up you are showing yourselfs and others that you are weak and cant handel it. It has also showed me to never put a negitve thinking and put a positive thinking, because if you but a negitive thinking everything could come up negitive and you will always try to give up if everything comes out negitive. Always put a positve thinking and everything will come out positive and you will feel motivated to keep fighting. Really hard problems help you keep your head up and learn to never give up on a really hard war. When my father was so mean to me I would always put my head up and not let the mean words get me down. To never give up and show him and the haters that I am stronger and better. When i cried because my mom was not with me and my father would not let me see her that showd me that my head was up all ready because I fighted to be with her. I have turned all my haters into my motivators, because I wanted to show them that I can do it . Always keep your head up high and never down because, keeping it down wont help at all. A problem is a chance for you to do your best. They are also helpful for you in your life because, they make you strong, so when you have an other problem it wont hurt you as much. Never give up of your problems, whatever problem you or your familly are going through never give up, because if you give up you wont be able to go to the past and change up everything that you gave up on. All those hater will always want to see you crying,mad, and sad and they also want you to feel like a big losser, all those haters turn them into your motivators, dont let them put you down. Stay strong and never forget that you are better, and stronger then that problem. Never feel bad that you showed the haters that you can do it. Always have a smile on you face, my mother told me even if you are upset always have a smile because, you have to smile to the hard world you are in.""

I agree with this quote from Winston Churchill,""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Its an important role that failure plays in our daily lives. Failure leads to many different directions,But, if we learn our mistakes we can understand what we did wrong. People sometimes have the enthusiasm or optional energy to get thought the obstacles. Some-others dont which its acceptable for this type of situation. Giving up faith is likely, giving up on yourself as an individual. Tools are like megalo, it helps us become the person we are today. Tools guide us to consist of good devolpement of character. It can read our thoughts and mind as a reader, when you specifically need them in hand. For example, working on a project from school, you use the internet to find those evidence to support your statement. You may never know that the tools you were looking for has been sitting their waiting to be taken. You knew it was the item you were searching for, soon enough it was a success. Without failures or mistakes, we wont even understood what errors we had. Life wouldve become a lot harder, stressed, overwhelmed etc. The more mistakes we resolved, more issues fills up. We wont even be able to undo our issues. It would waste more of youre time. I would argue with this fact, success comes from mistakes and obstacles along the path. It tells us what we should do and not fall into the same hole again. It takes time and effort to adjust,So, we must contribute as a whole. Therefore, no matter what obstacles we face in life, considering a side-note. There may be a tense of giving up, let it slide. You can active anything in life.

And specially if its from a company with great quality and management. Also i can learn how to socialize with people. Learning how to communicate is important for a company so everything is in order. Some companies dont know how to communicate and to be organize. Theyve to be anti-social so they can focus on their work and not on other employees otherwise theres consequence. Some companies are very strict with their employees. For examples employees have to be obedient to every single thing. As in theyve to follow every step correctly or they would get fired or worst. Thirdly, Your company is understandable to your employees. You treat them with respect and love as if they were your family.

However, its the exact opposite. people who works there seems to love it and to enjoy it! Theyve learned to be responsible and respectful in your company. You also are fair with your employees. Employees in that company gets payed well with no complains. They get payed exact the hours theyve been working. However, the way you manage your customers is incredible. Your customers are never disappointed what they order is exactly what they get. Employees always have a smile on their faces when receiving a customer. Theyre always gentle and polite. But more importantly patient because theyre a lot of customers who are slow or aggressive, they like to get attention. As great employees they handle any challenges. And i think its a perfect start for me because Ill do everything right with no excuses. In the other hand, your company is always nice and neat you make sure that the place looks good and prepared just in case important visitors come to visit your company. Mean while, i think the environment needs more companies as an this one. because everything about this company is splendid and spectacular. Theyve great service and employees.

Another example is if they and one hour and a half then there would be no time to have fun at school.

How they benefit you in your job or anywhere else? people say that working together is a better way of doing stuff then just working alone. But theirs other people who prefer working alone. Here are some of the benefits to both sides. I feel like working in a group is more beneficial because it lets you have a chance to ear new ideas. You can also finish the work faster if everyone is doing something. For example this one time. My friends and I were doing a project for drives Ed. We had sometime to think and write down ideas. After that all of us got together and agreed on some ideas. Then we each had our own part to do and we finished it during class. Some people believe that working alone is better. You can be more focused on you work. In addtion you can be more creative in your own way. I remember this girl in my biology class had to do her finial exam project. She decided to work by herself. The girl was res reaching and was really focused on that she was looking for. She got her information then made a really creative poster that went with the theme of the project. The teacher loved it and gave her an A for it. In conclusion working in a group benefits me the most. Their is less work to do. Everyone has good ideas.

Teachers can not manage their time. For example, my math teacher Generic_Name he has another job he wont be able to manage his time between teaching the student and the other job.

Imagine you have make up work that needs to be done but your teacher is busy? All staff will get tired. Imagine teachers, students, and people who in the cafeteria how they get tired if we make this decision? For example, I feel bad about the people who clean the cafeteria each day. All teachers will have hard time to explain to the student. For instance, I have my cousin he lives in Turkey. Their classes is about two hours and half.

For example, when I started 11th grade I was not doing well in Chemistry. I remember each day getting into the class and always starting with a warm-up about moles. The teacher gave us about ten minutes to solve the problems because they were easy, however; I always got almost all of them wrong. Almost all my classmates knew how to solve them, so I was too embarrassed to ask question in front of the class. My friend whos also in Chemistry, understood how to do those problems and much more about chemistry, so I asked her to help me. With her help I was able to do the problems on my own because she taught step by step on how to do them. As a result, my grades improved a lot. If Id decide to just let it passed I wouldve never been able to see how far I could have gotten get if I always keep trying. Second of all, you should always go as far as you can, never stop at on point just because you think is worthless or youre are not going to make it. For example, the women whos my manager at a fast food restaurant she started as a employee. Most of the coworkers told her that it was going to be challenging for her to be a manager .They were trying to make her stop doing something she wanted to do for her future, they told her to just stay there and see what happens next. Instead, of listening to what people were saying, she worked really hard and accomplish a lot more than she could be able of. If you really want to make something happen, you should always have to work for it, and not think it will just happen as a miracle. Third of all, some people may argue that doing something over and over again will never work, however; many people are able to prove that this statement is not true. For example, in a TV show about a girl who was always working toward getting into collage failed many times, but she never gave up. Because of her hard work and desire to keep working no matter what, one day she got accepted into a really privileged collage. By always doing something and never giving up is the key to accomplish everything. To conclude, in order to get something you should never stop working for it. Most celebrities and rich people are where theyre now because they always are doing something to make their dreams true and if at one point they had stopped I dont think they wouldve been successful. This world is full of opportunities but only those who always are working and never stopping are able to take advantage of it.

269,3222,F79EB8CBE0FE,"I agree with the Emersons statement because when you have a mastered you work better on the something to do, with the mastered you get better opportunities,you get better position than the people no have the mastered. Nevertheless not everybody agree this opinion, some people disagree because sometime people with not have mastered make better the job than the people with mastered. First, when you have a mastered your work better on this sometime to do, because this people have years to study and practice. For example in restaurant wen you have a mastered on chef you only need to memorize the recipes, other people need to memorize the condiments, the tools, and the machines is used. Second, with the mastered you get better opportunities, because you have a title show you already prepared for the job. For example some companies need you have a mastered for the job or the position, is like a some restaurants if you want to work like manager you need a mastered and you get more money. Third. you get better position than the people no have the mastered, because you show your experience. For example if on restaurant need people for kitchen, manager and dish washer with mastered you get the position of manager and the people with not have mastered is more probably put in dish washer and if he want to work with manager need more time and work more hard. In conclusion people with mastered have better opportunities, work better on the something to do and get better opportunities than the people with no have mastered. For this reason I agree the Emersons statement about if you no have a mastered you never grow.",7,4,6,4,4,6,3704,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 7"
270,301,3CACE02FBD5C,"There is a debate about if do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society. The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy. Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy. Now in our society good and hard working people is almost are scarcity because now some people the work in some countries the people doe not want to work they prefer be in their home doing nothing. But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community. There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.

In my opinion i would definitly agree on it since what he said was pretty true, he basically said something that is basically true and not only that its basically making you think that it is right that ""sucess consists on many thing but for sure loss of enthusiams""which is not wrong now i feel like ive thought about it just couple minutes and its making me think alot about it specially how much ive failed and life and always got up back like nothing was wrong.

All you have to do to get through things are get stronger and work on yourself more, feel valued to your surroundings.

274,2613,65975436BE5C,"True self-esteem dose come from praising someone to keep going and to follow their dream. Like a good friend once said ""never let anyone put you down always get right back up on your feet"". This is saying that people should believe in their self more than what other people say about them that will drag them down. People need to have thick skin to block all the negative haters and disbelievers because having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem. First, people need to be confident in their self in order to fallow what they want to achieve in life. For example, I was not confident on passing the SOL and my teacher was praising me to be positive and not to over think it. Then it came to the SOL, and when I finished it, the next day my teacher told me that I had passed. She later then told me that I should believe in my self more. This show that when someone praises another person that they will have confidants in their self. Second, courage can be helpful in over coming fears that can drag one self down. For example, when running a relay race and you start to fall behind. People end up giving up and saying in their head I lost there is no way to catch up because Im all ready in last place. People will want a friend to cheer them up and encourage them not to quit and to keep fighting. From the courage that is given to them then they will keep running till the finish line. This shows that courage can praise someone to keep going. Finally, many young teens should trust what adults say to them and not ignore them. However, some may say that teens can do what ever they want, they are wrong because teens need to be taught life lessons. For example, when I was younger I steal from stores with a couple of friends. My mother told me not to hang out with other teens that will cause trouble. Which I didnt listen to her and we got caught by the workers and they called our parents to come pay for the belongings we stole. This shows that by praise from adults, teens will make good choices that wont get them punished. In conclusion, praises can be very helpful for a person to feel good about their self. When taking any kind of test people will want to be successful. To when having to play in a sport people will want to win and not quit. Also to listen to people that are there for others no matter what. This shows that having courage, confident, and trust can help with self-esteem.",9,7,8,7,8,6,1326,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
275,268,50611B996992,"During this time our society are magnifying in many ways. Therefore, people has to work, study, or do any personal things every day. People dont conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades. To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they dont have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students. Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy. Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didnt do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades. To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our studentss health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy. After all, energy, time, and resources are the key to be successful.",7,7,6,6,5,6,1053,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Some educator feel that the summer break is to long and students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. Others argue that summer break is for students to take a mid break and stop think about school. Schools should not change the break system, because many students and parents had already planed,what they would do during the summer, and because many students work, and by changing the break system it could affect them, and because summer break is for students to relax, get a mid break and stop worrying about school. The school break system should not be change to 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the the spring, because many students work during the summer and many jobs do not gives students the opportunity to work only a few week or days,they want students work a lest two months so they can be able to give them the jobs, otherwise they would give the jobs to peoples that can stay more time with them. For example I work during the summer, and the company that I work with, only gives jobs to persons how agree to stay more than two months with them, if the school system change, this clear is going to affect me, because I going to lose my job and it would be difficult for me, to find another job during the break, because most of the jobs do not want people, how just going to stay in the company for a few days or weeks. The school break system should not be change , because students and parents have already planed , where they going to go, and what they going do, and if the school change the brake system, most of the plants that they had already made it, are going to be destroy . for example my bother and my parent visit my grandparents every single year and if the school break system change this could be a problem because they would have to come back more soon, and probably they may not go. The school break system should not be change, because students have the right to have a long break and stop think about all those worksheet,quizzes, and tests that ,they had already done during the school period,summer break should be a time to relax spent time with family and friends and not a time for be think and worry about school.

277,3317,D464E294DDB4,"Our character traits are formed by influences beyond our control. For example family has a very huge impact on who you become as A person because you are with them every day. Another big impact on our life is the community we grow up in. We do not get to choose who our family is therefore thats beyond our control. Family can influence you to either be a great person or A horrible person. For example If you grew up watching your father abuse your mother, you have a higher chance of putting your hands on females. How ever if you have kind, loving parents you have a higher chance of becoming a nice, loving person. Keep in mind we are with our family everyday so were most likely going to end up like them. We cant choose our community either therefore its beyond our control. Personally I feel like the community we grow up in has a huge impact on our life because it determines the kind of people you grow up around. For example if you grow up in a bad neighborhood you will be around gangsters and drug dealers. As a kid you may think selling drugs is fine because you seen other older kids do it. Selling drugs is going to result in you going to jail which means your going to be around other bad people which is most likely going to have an influence on the person you become. Others may think seeing bad should inspire you to be better but unfortunately it is not that simple. Your character is usually built over the years not over night.

Although some people say that taking drama, music or a art class is required, but I disagree because its their choice to take those classes or not to take those classes. If you think that those classes are required, then your wrong because, they wont do any classes that are forced them to take. If they are forced then they might like it when the class goes on, but if you say take the class or you wont pass then they will pass the class then just not doing anything. Say one student who doesnt like art but he takes it and he goes on and become a popular artist, then people will think I should try those classes and see. Say, they did take the class because it was required but they fail, the passing average of that class will go from high to low because of it bring required. If they say its required for half a year than full year then, I will choose they are but if its for whole year I will choose they arent required. I think they arent required to take those classes, because those classes arent meant for them. Because say they want to go for other things after high school that doesnt need music, arts and drama then it was just a waste of their school time studying those, but not the one that you need for after high school. They will take it but they wont do anything in the class if they are forced to take what they doesnt like. I think school just have some class that are mandatory to take but elective arent mandatory to take. Those classes should be elective than are required to take all those class. In conclusion that, if they choose its required to take those class, it might change their subject on what to do after school, but for some it will not change it. If they choose not to make it required than it will have their passing average higher than going low, and that the student can take the classes they want to take.

Lening reached his goals because he was never idle, for he was always doing something in his life. Although some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore, actually being active serves a purpose because we can increase our knowledge in; work,home and gaming and if we are studying a subject such as; Medicine, 3D Animated Cartoons and CyberSecurity we can master it ,and later on we can teach others. Some say that inactivity serves a purpose because we can wait for the right moment to start an errand or chore. Once a read an article on Newsela that was about how a men waited to start his goal, and he ended up getting his goal very quick. The man was called Generic_Name. Generic_Name wanted to save up to buy a house. He started ti save up for two months, later on he won the lottery, Generic_Name was very happy about it, then he deposited all his money into his savings account. Time pass by and he realized he had enough money to buy his dreamed house. Generic_Name bought the house, and he lived happily ever after. If we are inactive we can wait for the right moment to start and errand or chore. My Aunt(Generic_Name) wanted to do and errand but she decided to wait because she saw on CNN News that if we wait to do and errand or chore the succession rate increases by 25%. She did the errand and it went more smoothly than ever, he waited to do it and she succeeded on doing it. Being inactive for a while its good because if we decide to rush things the odds might be against us. My friend Generic_Name always like to rush things. One day he couldnt wait to buy a game that he went in the middle of the night to buy it. When he got to the store, the store was already closed. He walked form the game store to his house. He was very sad that he could not bought the game, later on he saw a women in white standing right in front of him. He woman in white turn down and he saw her.. the we ran like crazy. Its always better to wait to do something such as buying a game, don;t rush things or you will end up like Generic_Name. Its so good how many we can accomplish if we are always doing something, but if we are inactive we can always wait for the right moment to start doing something. ""Determine never to be idle...

287,3453,ADFE2CDB6FF1,"Yes i think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home in the way that they can be more ready to start the class, and they will focus. -The reason why i though that is because sometimes at school the students they have shame to show to other the best of them, "" the intelligent student told me that i cant do anything or i cant speak very well English"" still if we want make our goals we can do it. Without go to the school. -For example: If a student is on his house alone with no one told him what or how he need to do the correct things, but he has a lot of question about what he is doing in his online class. He will try to find the way to solve the problem by himself. Also if i was in my home find new imformation and i work to much during the day then i would be hungry then i can go to the kitchen for cook something very fast and go back to my room continue with my homework. And if i have a question i will ask for help to some teacher by texting. Eventually, attend classes at home with no pressure could made different and confortable for the students who are shy or maybe need a teacher only for one student for explain the class that the student is taking. Below for those students that dont like to wake up too early in the morningt they have the choose to study more later since at night without necesary be ready for school. Many cases when girls are pregnant they can still going at school, but it was diffult for them had to continue study and also after that they giving birth too. i know that because a friend told me and another girls too, she told us the process that she has to pass during her pregnancy and after when she has her baby with her I dont know how hard it is, but i can imagine in this position. So what my friend do? during her pregnancy she still coming to the school i saw her many time she was so tired with her belly and then when she has her baby yet she take in her house the next classes i was surprise about it either i do not how unconfortable it was for her that a teacher was with her when the baby start cry or when the baby need to eat, later she was done she back to the school but she didnt feel ok for leave her baby at home. This story make me think about it if i have the election to choose how i can study i prefer study and take the classes in my house better that school. I think the students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home thats great idea. but there are many problems; what happen if the student do not have money to pay the online classes? either their families do not have the recourses for help them another reason thats why we have to work and make money for us and we missing many days in the school for stay at home because we want sleep more hours or we coming to the school and we are no pay attention what the teacher is talk about the class, So i think this if a student want money need to work and continue study online maybe in that way is more easy pass the class and the SOL. Attend classes from home by way online help this type of case the students go to work few hours and then coming home for the rest of the day to study or another option is one day work and the next day dont and stay at home taking the online classes, in summary ""NEVER GIVE UP"" when we want something that we cant get it in nowhere only in our effort we can make that possible. Also with some help ask when we do not understand something and put the best of us all including: try to solve the problems, research good imformation, and the most importat thing that we have to do is study. sometimes the other people make feel us so bad or without no reason to be in this world, go ahead and desmostrate to that person who do not believe in you that you can do it. During school year is possible learning for online or video conferencing,in the videos explain clearly what or how to solve math ejercise or another kind of materials. Examples of benefit to attend classes at home are: - Spend more time in the computer - More focus in the homework - Use the iphone for imformation whenever we want - Study all the day - No talk with your friends during your class - Finish more fast with no distraction All that things are benfit if the students being to attend classes in their home in the winter they dont have to worry about how cold is outside in the morning or what clothes is appropriate for school, and have to coming in the school in a good mood for study and see somebody that we do not want to see and prevent be involve in problems with another student. Could fine stay at home by self in own class than go to the school. Many student suffer of depreciation and that is so bad for them. If they school giving to them the opportunities to take the classes online it is more better for their healthy, this is my opinion about attend classes on the home.

Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we dont even need it because were to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on peoples lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things. In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. Thats when kids want to isolate themselves and dont go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they dont even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and dont even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on peoples life and causes them to have depression. Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that its not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life. Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing its just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital. In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. Its usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People dont even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but its only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home. Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we dont even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on peoples lives because can cause people to lose theyre touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and peoples physical or mental health.

It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall. The days will be shorter since the school year is longer. I believe not everyone has something to do over the 3 months of summer break. It will be easier for people to hold the information when they return in the fall. A large amount of people forget what they learn in school when they return from the 3 months of summer break. Everytime summer break comes I forget mostly all the information information I learned, it just leaves my head over those months. When we get 3-4 weeks over summer break, not all the information will leave. It will be easier for us students to not forget what we learned over the months. School days will be shorter since the school year is longer or we can have one weekday off and have school at a regular time. They can change it so students dont have to wake early in the morning. Some people cant wake up early and some people get off work late and have school the next day. Students can have one weekday off, like a Wensesday or Friday off. It will give them time to relax and stay focus on school. Since, the school days are shorter, they can have time to theirselfs and not be stressed. I believe not everyone has something to do over the three months of summer break. They might just do something for one month and for the another two months might not do anything. They might just stay inside and play video games all day and not read or not pick up a book the whole break. They might not even exercise all day. Students need to have something to do over the breaks, so they can keep learning. Sometime I believe its a bad idea. Students will stay a school the whole year until they gradute, and they need to spend time with their family. Some students dont really like school and they will get too stressed and breakdown over the year, so they need a long break from school. Students need time for theirselfs, so they dont stress as much. Students will stress over too much work and they have after school jobs, so they cant do their homework. Having 3-4 weeks of summer break, a longer winter, and a week off in the spring and fall is a great idea. It will be easier to hold the information when you return in the fall.

Furthermore, when your nervous and you had a problem, Some people get trauma and they think of that problem and they are afraid of doing it again, For example, I missed a tackle at football once and I was scared of doing it again, so when I had the chance of doing it again I thought about if i would miss it like last time.

My opinion is that students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. There are many reasons why I think the above. Sudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students or electives. Student want to be taking or doing many things that they are into to. I think that music, drama, or an art class should be electives. Strudents are capable of choosing whats best for them and what they like to do because they want to do what intesrests them. For example, I do not like to take music, it bores me. I would rather take drama. People are very diferent from each other. Such as music, drama, and art should be extra credit for students that are interested in thiose kind of electives/classes. We just need to give students a chance to do their own things and be choosing their own kinds of thing. Counselors or teachers should not be picking students electives. The reason why I think this is because all electives should not be classes in general. For example, some people like math, instead of students taking an art class, ect. They can be taking another math class. If thats what they love learning about because with art, we cant do anything with it in the future. Which in math we mostly use it and need it in everything.

Students who experience anxiety attacks, depression, bullying, or just not being able to attend school for the day will find great use in online school, they can connect with their classes or teachers without being in school and not have to miss out on important information or work. Students are able to be in a safe environment at home if they do not feel comfortable in school. Furthermore, students with anxiety or depression may have a harder time going through out the school day then their peers. For example, my girlfriend who has very often panic attacks, dislikes attending her current school. She was a new transfer student to the school and was also new to the school itself. She found it hard to not have anybody to go to and vent during the school day which causes her to stress and have anxiety. Moreover, she gets very often panic attacks during the day which makes her not want to come to school more often. She finds it easier and safer to stay at home. When ever were on the phone over face time, shes always doing her class work that she takes home to complete. Shes a hardworking student and always does her work but because of the environment shes in, it limits her on what she is capable of. Not only that it would help students feel secure, but for the students who are sick for the day and cannot attend school, wouldnt have to miss out on important information or work. For example; there are days where I just feel weak and tired but I wouldnt want to miss a review day for a major test the next class. If there was online school, I would be able to connect with my teacher and the classes from home where I feel comfortable. Also, my mom wouldnt have to worry that im failing my classes because im not showing up to them. I believe that other students would agree with me on this argument because almost everyone I know, wishes they could attend school from home. Moreover, adults might not have knowledge of this, but let me tell you; there is a lot of drama and rumors in every high school. No matter where it is, the policies it has, the advances of the students, there is drama. And drama is one major factor on why students wishes to attend school at home. Just Imagine the advances of our present civilization if there was no drama at school, and no have you heard this or have you heard that. Drama and rumors are big time distractions to daily school work and it peaks the interest of every student. By enabling online school, students dedicated to become scholars are able to take this distraction out of their equation. They can attend school without dealing with the big mouths talking up and down and all around the school. Overall, distance learning has a very good impact on the students. Students feel safer at home, and when they are sick or cannot attend school for they day, they wouldnt have to miss out on important information or work.

The first reason I like volcanoes as an eductaion activity is because they are intresting. Ive always wandered what caused a volcano to explode. Now I dont need to because I know now what causes them to erupt so voliently. Valcanoes are very fascinating to watch erupt when you see the magma flowing down. The magma can be so hot it can be like being hit with a ray from the sun. Its very awesome how the volcanoes are fromed and made. But as cool as volcanoes are they can still be pretty dangerous,because they could cause harm and erupt,cause chaos. sometimes volcanoes erupt at random times. Sometimes in villages or islands and in this case people dont have time to run. Because the magma flowing down is like an avalanche because it goes really fast and the people cant outrun the magma because it is to fast. There have been more volcanic eruptions that have killed people even children. Like pompei which was a huge volcanic eruptionthat killed a lot of people. After the eruption paremedics and police went back to discover the remains of people under huge rocks. Volcanoes are very intresting althougj they can be dangerous at times its amazing how it looks when it erupts. Volcanoes are one of the greates things to study. Next a volcano would make agreat science project. A volcano is a good science fair project. Because its very amusing to see how the volcano erupts. When it erupts you can see the hot flowig magma as if people on a raft were going down. Volcanoes are a good science roject because it lets you know more about volcanoes and how thy come to form. Volcanoes are very rare to find here where I live at but there are still some outhere. Thats a good science project not only because they explode but because you can even show the layers. Volcanoes have layers the top the middle and the bottom. The top is where the magma shoots out like a bullet from a rail gun. The middle is the less calm part and the bottom is where all the magam is. That is why I think a volcano is a good science project.

Students should not be able to participate in more than two activities at school. because they will get tired a lot, and therefore they will not do their homeworks. Participating in any of the activities should also be a credit for the students.

The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them. Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well. Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them. Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun . The second reason you need to be honest is with your family .

In addition, principal should offer distance learning for student that the way could not affect them because student might have a natural disaster in their neighborhood, student might be sick in such manner that could not attend school, that might affect their grade and they might repeat the year. First reason, student might be absent for a reason like to be sick in such manner that could not attend school. All included student that is special that they go for a week or more in the hospital. Moreover, student sometime the doctor let a lot of appointment for them to check up or appointment with the dentist. Also, student who have allergies when the weather change they got affect in that they may not come to school. In high school, student sometime they get pregnant and the doctor let them many appointment including when they delivery they lose many school days and that affect many student lose the year or they may get affect their grade. Because we dont know in the future what will happen to some of our student that many of them dont find any solution of their problem. In fact, we dont know what it will happen if we dont give an opportunity to our students. We must pay attention to them if they lose many days of school sometime they are afraid to talk about their problem. Second reason, student in their neighborhood might have a natural disaster also might need the distance learning in order to not lose school days. Sometime the weather get so angry that may bring accident or can bring tree crashing in our hose or may get rain and rain that could bring floating that may cause a lot of problem to some our students. In addition, the school bus may not get as in order to come to school. If it a student that walk that student could not get to school and the County could not cancel the school or even in theres no light and that may tell an announcement that student could not get informed about the school information weather. Because, if student get that problem the principal could not believe and it can not give an chance to those student to take the test or the exam that they had in class. After all, in the school no one care about you even if you have a teacher that it is so inpatient. To end with, the school should offer the distance learning to some of our students. Student may got sick for a little reason and if they had natural disaster, we should care about it. If we find a student that always is absent we should ask them what is the matter or what is the problem with them? While some may argue that if we offer the distance learning student may not lose school days and even they could not lose their grade student could have benefit from this way student could not lose, however some may argue that if we gave the distance learning to student student could not enjoy this learning they just will playing even if we give the distance learning in computer they just see it they they will start playing video game or they just will watch a video. Finally, we should give the student an opportunity they will enjoy it and they will not throw it away. ",6,4,5,5,4,5,2731,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 6"
299,122,F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school. I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school. Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school. In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours.",7,7,6,7,6,6,3642,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

301,281,0C7D385D812A,"How should people take decisions?? thats the real question should a person follow a feeling or motion call instincts or should they make a decision by guidance by experts and the laws and authorities. Well a person should use advise really. For example lets say a business man has to make a decision about if he should invest money or not on a product thats been selling good for the last few months but in the pass they werent selling as much. so the business man has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesnt want to make the wrong decision and make the company waste money they wont get back. Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate. Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want. Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer. In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.

302,1887,E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources. As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I dont agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesnt. Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, lets use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they arent really saving energy Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him. Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he wont get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we wont have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments. However, teachers opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they arent robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers. My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybodys benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the schools main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We dont know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we dont have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesnt have, which make us a different environment than the business.

The phrase that Duke Ellington said is a good phrase and i totally agree with it because the problem you have or that you will get is a chance for you to do you best at fixing it or solving because the problem will give you a chance to do your best unlike if you come across a problem of just get a problem and you dont try to fix it or dont care or sit back and just watch your problems just pile up and then problems just come and come one after another then you have more then one problem and its just better if you do good on your first problem and you fix an if its big problem and you over come it at the end you will feel great like Duke Ellington he is now legend at jazz music and you know t is not easy to get were he got to be called a legend at jazz music and on his way to the top to become a legend all ways remembered every were you go for he had to over come lots of problems the hate the way he was going to play jazz were he would play his jazz to start up who could give him a boost or help with the jazz to be known more around him were he would get more new instruments money for a place to keep all his music how would he sell his music and all those problems he had to over come and fix and he still made it to his dream and know he is legend.

305,1789,310CDA45739E,"Imagination is like thinking to do diet and go to gym to get slim. Knowledge is just like running on a treadmil for 2 hours in a weak to get your weight under 79. I believe that Imagination is more Important than knowledge, because when the writer writes a book, first they Imagine the topic for their book. They dont start to write the book unless they Imagine the topic. Same as, the writers Imagine what they want to write about, they dont just start to get Information about something, asking their parents what to write, how to write. They Imagine, then they start their work. However, Imigination is also similar when you think with your sister to convince your mom to get you lots of candy. You dont ask your dad, how to convice mom to get candy. For example, the person who get the idea to Invent phone, frst he Imagine, what does phone look like, how many buttons should be there, and then he also get help with his knowledge but first he Imagine what does phone look like, how will people buy this, why should they buy my phone. Also If we use knowledge more than Imagination, the new generation will only use the cell phones to search for their homeworks. They will not Imagine to do homeworks or other things by theirself. They will just copy someones idea, which is going to demolish their brains. There will be no more good inventions, The peoples brain will stop working. Also, people will not do their work because they know they can just copy someones idea. For example, If I dont Imagine that when I will be 16, how I am going to get a job. What If I just go to Youtube and search for it, but I will not find anything and I will waste my Important time. Incase if I imagine what kind of job I want to do or where I want to do, I am pretty sure that It will not waste my time. Infact It will give me some ideas for future. In my opinion we should imagine more than using knowledge. Imagination keeps your brain work and It also keeps you active. If we dont use imagination then how our new Inventors will Introduce their creative inventions. If the stylists doesnot use their imagination then how we are going to wear brautiful clothes. If they use just knowledge and dont use their imagination, I guess they will not get that much success in their buisness. Designers use their minds to help with their clothes design. They imagine the ideas for clothes, so the people will buy more and more clothes from them. The people who use Imagination more than knowledge live longer. From now I will also use imagination as more as I can. So I will give an opinion to all of you who are reading this use your imagination than knowledge and get success in your work. I dont say that using knowledge is a waste of time, use your knowledge also but not all the time, also use your mind to imagine good, Intresting things. In conclusion Imagination is more Important than knowledge. So, I will agree with scientist Albert Einstein. I will also force you to think about this. Writers, designers , Inventors all uses their Imagination more than knowledge. Now I will also try to focus on my Imagination more than focusing to copy others information.

My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. This model will be helpful for students, and teachers at same time. By giving them more time to relax. It be the best option for students because it will give them more time to experience, learn new information in a young age. We all as a student need more time to prepare for future, and work as hard as possible to pass our classes. Furthermore, same for the teachers, they will be able to have more time with their families; and they can enjoy their lives with three days weekend. My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours because teachers and students will have more time to relax, to grow and achieve more, and to help others. We all need to relax, specially if we are a student because school is so stressful, and two days weekend will not give enough time to students to relax. Two days weekend will just be enough for students to spend time with their families and do their homework; it will not give them time for themselves. Moreover, by two days weekend students can not relax and work for themselves. I personally rather to have more time during the weekend because I will have more time to finish everything that I wanted to do during the week, and I will have time to relax. During the weekdays students can learn more and they will have more time in school to spend with their friends. Some people think that three days weekend will make students forget what they learned during the week. But they are wrong because students will have more time to go over what they learned, and they have enough time to practice more. Most of the people loves to exercise, read, meditate, and swim in their free times. Three days weekend will give students and teachers more free time to care about themselves. Most of my friends love to exercise, but some of them gave up on exercising because they dont have time to do it. They are working Saturdays and studying on Sundays. One of my teachers told me, that she loves to read book in weekends, but she does not have time to read because she has a lot of work to do. Reading, exercising, meditating, and swimming will help human to grow and learn more to achieve more. Also, four days weekdays will teach students to work harder. Some people think that students and teachers should not have longer weekend than usual because they have winter break, and spring break. But they are wrong because longer weekend can help both students and teachers to care more about themselves by giving them free time. Some of the students love to help others, by volunteering. Three days weekend will increase students chances to help others because they will have more time to do it. My sister loves to volunteer and help other; she is volunteering once a month. She told me that she wants to increase it and do it more, but she can not because she has a lot of homework and she does not have time. Although, their are a lot of students who need help in some of their classes because they have a bad grade. If we give the students more time to study, they will get better grades. Last year during winter break, my math teacher told me that I have to try harder and study more, I told him that I can not understand the notes. We met in the public library and he helped me to study. He said, ""I love to help students outside of school, but I dont have time to do it"". I think we have a lot of teachers like that, who wants to help students outside of school, but they dont have time. If we have longer weekends, teachers will be able to help more students. Some people think that schools should have two days weekend because they are not getting tired. But they are wrong teaching and learning are the most hardest things in the world. To converse energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. my school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours. And this will help students and teachers to have more time to relax, to care about themselves, and to help others. Students can have more time with their families, to grow, and to work harder and achieve their goals. Furthermore, teachers are also the same, teachers need more time to spend with their families and kids, and they will be able to plan what are they going to do, or what they want to do with certain students who needs help. Also, in weekdays they can learn more, or teach more. Which it is a great opportunity to both of them to achieve more.

310,672,7C2650EEA2B6,"Do you think a three month break is too long ? Some professors feel that summer break is too long and students are most likely to forget everything they have learned when they return to school. However, both professors and students deserve a nice, long break because ten months of high school can cause tons of stress, people get to spend more time with their families, and last but not least, students can take classes during the summer if they want to graduate early. First, most students want to attend to good colleges, therefore, they take advanced classes in high school in order to receive more credits. Teachers give more assignments in advanced classes and the work is much harder than course classes. Students often have to stay up late to finish school work. In addition, with little amount of sleep can cause students serious stress. For instance, my cousin once took six college classes in her junior year of high school. She never had much time to eat nor sleep, to the point where she passed out. My family had to take her to the doctors for a checkup. They said that she had stress issue and it may take a long time for her to recover. Luckily, with three months of summer break, she became better. Second, some students dont want to spend four years in high school when they have an opportunity to graduate early. In order to do so, they must take all of the requirement courses. Though, not all courses are available during the school year, however, students can take it in the summer. For example, my best friend, Generic_Name, took English 11 over the last summer, so she could graduate early from high school and soon become a nurse. She learned everything she needed for the tests within two months of summer school, Third, many people love to spend time with their families. Summer break would be an awesome opportunity for both teachers and students to go on vacations with their loved ones. They can travel to different states or even countries if they like. In the summer of 2015, my family and I had a great time in Generic_City. I got to experience many amazing things, it was the best summer I have ever had. Though, the most wonderful time of the year is summer, however, some argue that there should be year round schools and only three to four weeks of break in the summer. In conclusion, all students and teachers, including staff members deserve a nice, long summer break. Most people agree that school is very stressful, therefore, a three month break is not too long. Some says that when one is stress out, they cant think nor do things well. On the other hand, when their mind is relax they will achieve successful things in life.

Some people think people should make their on decisions, its easy to see both sides, but one stands out people should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters, because new ideas can help us decide something and guidance help us when were confused to make that decision. First, new ideas can help us decide something that were not sure to decide. Guidance can explain what you want; they can tell us what is better for us or if something going to work.

Some students just like to take their time and explore new things and that way it can give them ideas about what to do in the future. Other students just decide what to do when they are in college. That being said, committed at young age, exploring new things, deciding in college. Students being committed at a young age is helpful and will benefit themselves for the future. Students sticking to one area for their career at a young age and just being focused on it is what they need in order to get there. Especially if they are focusing and putting hard work at a young age. However, some students may not enjoy having to just stick with one area. Students will not be able to enjoy what other students enjoy. Exploring new things at the young age is very fun. With students being committed at a young age and all, exploring new things at a young age is very fun. Students do not have to worry or stress about being committed to just one thing. Students exploring at a young age will have more opportunities to see what they like. Students will enjoy more of their time rather than other students who are committed to one thing. Unless if students really love to what they are committed to, they wont enjoy much of their time. For example, if one student is committed to one thing but does not love what he is doing and the other student who is exploring new things and enjoying his time, then the student exploring will enjoy more of his time and be happy as well. Being committed at a young age, exploring new things are fun but Lastly, students decide what to do as they enter college. Students deciding as they head to college is pretty tough. Some students wont be able to prepare for whats coming. For example, if students had chose what to do while they were in high school then they would have time to prepare for what they would be doing in college. But choosing what to do as you head in to college can be tough for some students. In conclusion, being committed at a young age is good and beneficial for students but it can get boring and sad, unless if students truly love what they are doing. Students entering college and immediately deciding what to do without actually knowing anything about what they chose is not so fun. Now students who explore new things at a young age is what most students should do. This way they know what they will enjoy and what they wont enjoy. Students can do whatever they want to at a young age. Once students find what they love. They can stick to it and have it as their career.

People can check out books, shop, and play games without speaking to another person has limitation on humans contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives. I believe that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because we can talk with people in long distance, working online without driving,and find new friends. The first reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives is because we can talk with our family that are not with us. Also when we missed them we can video call each other, and know about each others life. For example if there was no technology we cant talk with our families that are in long distance. And we dont know about each other, and maybe we will forget each others by the time past. Thats why technology is the best thing that we have in our lives. Everyone should have technology because its important for them and maybe something happen to you like accident and your family can find you by using their technology and find where the accident is happen. furthermore you can use technology when you are sick and you cant go to your work you can call your boss to tell him/her that you cant come today, if there was no technology it wasnt possible to do these things. Second reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives because people can work online without driving and vesting their time. Initially when you working online you can save your money and can do all of your work in your house. However thats good because if you have a children and you want to be with her/him it can help you because you can do your work and be with your child. Furthermore if you cant drive and you wish to work at home technology will help you to work online without driving long distance. Furthermore technology is good thing when you want to travel you can travel and at the same time you can work by your technology, and you can make more money. Third reason is that technology had positive effects on peoples lives that we can find new friends ,culture and new languages. Initially when you go to social media you can see different people with different culture and you want to know about their culture and their languages, so technology will help you to communicate with them and ask them question about their religion, country and etc. Furthermore when you going to some other country that you dont know your way technology will helps you to find your way. For example when you going to the country that you love to know about that country more but you cant ask question because you dont know the people, and their language in there, also you lost yourself in there you cant talk or ask them for help. Thats when you can use technology to helps you, you can talk with them by using your phone translator.

317,2914,3B93AE972238,In this school year I may be doing Homework club because I want it to get all of my homework done at school and to turn it in on time. Homework club is a go thing that I chose because their are teachers their to help you to get your homework done. Another go thing in homework club is that if you have trouble with your homework the teachers could help you with it. kids will love if the school time never changed so they could get home on time and even the bus driver and the teachers to. Well I think that the kids wont like it because lots of kids will be coming home late in night will the bus driver and the teachers if they live far from school. The after school stuff will be late into the night for the kids who will be staying and some of the teachers to and the bus driver to if the schools add one and a half hour to school each day. Kids will hate it if the school adds another one and half hour to school each day so some kids hope that they do not started school at 8:00 oclock in the morning and they finished school at 5:18. Some kids will kind of love the idea that the school is adding one and half hour because some kids love school that they just dont want to go home and do their homework because you have to take your baby brother. Some kids will love to stay after school and the stuff they do and lots of kids will problem stay at homework club to get all their homework done for all their classes so they do not get a bad grade if they did not do their homework. Some kids will like to come home at 6:50 or 7:00 oclock because they could just eat their food and they did all of their homework and they could just watch T.V. Some kids will love the idea to add one and a half hour to school each day and some of the kids will hate the idea. Lots kids will love the idea to stay after school for a long time and they could come home late and some kids will hate to have to come home late if you have after school everyday.

318,280,009BCCC61C2A,"positive attitude is the key to success. I agree because you can do anything as long as you put your mind and soul into it and motivation you can accomplish it. Then so by doing it you feel good about yourself youll feel unstable. But do what brings the best in you, what makes you yourself. One way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself. Then another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude isent quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything theyre just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then theres always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a beatifull flower with of course hard work and it isent in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude. Next reason is to build selfcondifence. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build selfcondience our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the selfcondicence its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle fild the more selfcondidence we will have. So then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the negitive thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore. I truly incuage you to try it out if you want to see a big improvement to succeed in your life.

319,1701,7680EF5AD3CB,"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because its pointless, unfair, and not important. To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. Its also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. Its no where near educational related. It wouldnt be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class. The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless. In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. its not important for students to take any of those classes. Its not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job.

320,3615,29905A8482BC,"- Today in the actuality is easier to take classes or courses, online or video conference, because the system of education is always trying to improve them self as everything in the world. The internet is our big source that we need everywhere and in different circumstances and the technology is a big advance that has a lot of benefits for us, like make our life easier. My point of view about the student attending classes from home. First, most of the students in High School are teenagers, if they are in their homes taking classes it make the possibility that they do not socialite with the people and they can not find a firm personality. Second, the students could have problems in their vision in cause of the long time looking a monitor, laptop, tablet, Etc. Third, some of the students are beneficiary of their free lunches in school, so, if they are in home it will be more expensive for the parent to pay extra food. To conclude, those were some of my points of views or disagrees about attend to school from home. This is a list about the agrees and it could be a benefit in my opinion: Do not have to spend gas going to school. Do not spend in different clothes everyday. The government, do not have to pay a lot of teachers, so maybe taxes can get lower. We can use a different schedule to see classes, and the other time to work. The students do not have to socialize with the teacher, so, no disagrees and problems between the student and the teacher. This ideas was basically what i think about attend classes from home, maybe it could be better or maybe no, the mostly reason i think is fine to attend school from home is, if you have a disability or sickness that dont let you go to school.

321,525,ECF265A73C7E,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students dont have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher wont let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school. The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",7,7,7,8,8,8,3463,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Example one is about my friend he work after school sometimes he work between 5 to 12 and he after this he need to wake up at 5 for go to the school , I think this is heavy for him because he always is tire in the first class because he can sleep well in the night , but he need to graduated from high school because this is the only way he can have a better life. Many students in high school work after school , I think this program can help they because they can continue working and they can sleep more , this can help they to have a better grades because they can sleep more because sometimes they have a bad grades because they dont have the time to do the homework and the study for the test . Example 2 is about the many girl in high school are pregnant , this program can help this girls because I see many girls dont want to return to high school , when they are pregnant because when theyre pregnant sometimes people say bad thinks about they ,because theyre to young for have a baby. but with this program they can take the classes from their houses .This can help they to graduated from high school because this is a better way to completed their classes , cause sometimes many girls decide to continue in the normal schools but when they have the baby they can not to continue because they need to take care for the baby. but with this program they can finish their classes. For my conclusion this is a good idea because they can help many students who have some problems . because they can finish high schools , because they dont have time because sometimes they need to work. but with this program they can help this students because this is a good idea for help this students . because they can benefit if they take the classes from their houses.",6,5,5,4,4,4,613,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

I strongly agree with them, if you come to think about it been positive may give you the corage to do surtend things. You would belive in yourself and most possiblie make your goals come true. It also would be hard for you to get your feelings hurt. People wont be able to brake you down that easily. So in my personal opinion, having a possitive attitude actually is the key to a success in life. When i said it gives you the corage to do surtend things i mean it. Because, you might want to make a goal in you life come true, but your probably to shy or your thinking ""oh theres no way im going to make it"". Thats the main problem, you have a negative energy witch bring you to have a negative action. Sometimes your words reflect your actions. This is why i think if you have a possitive attitude you will sucess in life. Been positive or having a positive energy is like the meaning of ""faith"". Lets talk about why i mention ""faith"". Having faith makes you believe in yourself When you have a negative attitude your of course going to have a negative action. But in many religions if you have faith everything is possible. This is why i compare these two words, that are very similar to each other. So if you have ""Faith"" you must have a possitive attitude. Having a positive attitude can help you out emotionaly too. If your possitive at all times no matter what people say about you it wont hurt you as bad. The reason i belive it wont hurt you as bad is because, you would believe in your self and wont let other negative attitude ruin yours. For example, if i say to myself ""Man i alredy know i aint going to pass this test , i aint even going to try"". Oviosly im going to fail because, having a negative energy reflects not to even try. So if you want to sucess in life like i do, you should try to change your attitude and try been positive at all times.",7,6,6,6,6,5,1822,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
329,3583,B5AE26EEE247,"Do you think that having a positive attitude is the key towards success in life? In my opinion I do think it is key towards success, and the reasons why I think this is one finding a good career, second is meeting new people in a good way. In life you need money to pay bills and in order to get money for your bills is to get career, a good one at least, and everyone knows that you need a resume, a good skill that your going to work for, and a good/positive attitude to help you get the job. you people may wonder ""why need to have a positive attitude to get your job?"" well you want to impress and increase your rate of the person that is considering to hire you or not, also if start talking in a boring way the person might not hire you. The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never in a negative way. meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage theyll treat you the some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so thats why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention or you just like treating people positive because thats your nature. I know how this world works and to survive the world of negativity is to be negative as well to survive this world, however that isnt the way to live and nobody likes to do negative things as well as they cant hold it for long time and end up taking away their own life, so staying positive is a great way to live in life. The conclusion I am trying to give at out is that being positive is the a great way live instead of living in a way of negativity since being negative is way to tough to live out and positively gives you joy and give more paths to walk through and thats what I think a key to success means.",8,7,7,7,7,7,2448,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
330,2439,8060FCE12001,"Should students enjoy less summer vacation and more winter break. Why would they change the vacation time? Cant it just stay the same as usual? Would the students like like that change? Are those changes going to help the students in their studies? First of all some students wont like this change because,in the winter time it can get really cold ,so the students wont be able to go outside,walk,nor play. Also one of the reasons they wouldnt like the change is that i summer break they can be outside and go out places. In the winter could get really cold and the students stay outside for a long period of time they might get a could and miss some school days and affect them. If they miss schools days they will be behind from the class. In the other hand some students might like that idea because in the summer time it can get really hot outside .If its really hot outside people can get dehydrate ,but for other reasons summer days can be some amazing days. Some benefits of summer : going to the beach,amusement park,camping,and travel. Reasons that students will like to have more summer vacation:more vacations days,nice weather to go outside, go to the pool,explore nature and helps them to stop using technology. If this change in vacations happen I wont like it,because I like being outside in warm weathers and i woulld hate to have less summer break and more winter break .Plus I hate when we dont have school when theres a snow s day. I like how the vacation time is right now because everyone can enjoy some vaction in the tie that the like the best . I am aslo sure that most of the student will like to keep the same time of vacations beacuse they want to have more not less In conclusion the time of vacation will not change because the students will prefer to keep the same one .They will like to enjjoy the time not hate it. My point is if the studdent dont like the new time they will problobly wont like to g back to school and just ingnore it. So if they want to change the time talk to the student if they are ok with it ,if not then make a solution about it.

331,2941,C61946131A41,"Identifying a career at a young age. Identifying a career at a young age may be difficult for some students ,most of them think different ,some of them doesnt even care about their future or what they are going to do with their life ,parents may think this is a good idea because they want a good life and good future for their childrens and want them to be successfull and this will change their perspective of thinking. Although some people think that this idea is a bad idea , and this is going to be hard for students,because the students are going to have more homework,projects,test to get prepared for their career and some quizzes too,Actually people this days is use to only if the students gratuated and get out of school is when they have to start thinking on what the students want to do or work , for example if students finish high school and they start to work in a regular work like a restaurant,they may think im already here working good ,I get pay good ,why would I go to school again,I dont need to go school again just to spend money ,Im good like that just getting my own money to wasted only for me,and this would be the way he is thinkg because when he was in high school; people didnt talk to him about careers when he was at school. One reason for start identifying what students want at a young age is because they would have a lot of time to think what they really want in their life ,for example if a student is in 9 grade and he says I want to be a police and then he is in 11 grade and he think different and he wants to be a doctor,he would a chance to change his career because he had time to do it , another example i can give if like what is a student want to start knowing how his career work, like the doctor career he may wanna know how much credits he need to make in high school , how many years his career is going to take ,if he is going to have the opportunity to go collage, would he be able to pay his career,thats why is a good idea to start thinking at a young age,and start to getting prepare for what he is going to do in his career. Another reason for start thinking what the students want in their life,is that they may know on what they are good at,to know their self,and start to think if they are going to be successfull in their future ,they may start doing good in high schoool to do credits and try to get a scholarship ,for example the student finish high school and he is going for his career maybe a doctor and at the middle of his preparation for being a doctor he saids Im not good at this and this career is not going to a successfull for me I would only give up a this point , he may think this way because he didnt have opportunity to change what he wannted to change ,why? because the school start to talk about this when he was in 12 grade and he did have change to think well,he didnt have chance to change his way of think ,another example I can give is that some students like latinos students , some of them doesnt have a good economical life and this may be hard forsome of them on finishing their career ,so they have to start getting credits ,start to get good grades to get a scholarship, Because most of the latinos students want to be successfull in their ife and this would work for them ,Identifying want students want for their future at a young age is good ,because they know what they really want and this really work In conclusion ,Identifying a career at a young age is good because the students will have they time to know what they really want ,and to know on what they are good at,and start to do good at high school for they to graduated,the students will have more opportunities in their life is they choice a good career for their life , this is a plan that would change the way how students think;young students think better and very clear and this may guide them toward a specific career in their life.",7,7,6,6,5,6,2683,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

333,3882,16C794A0F479,"students should not be allow to use their cellphone during class time only if it is necessary or with the teacher permission. One of the most important reason why you should not be allow to use your phone during class is because the cellphone really distract you, it may be because youre playing, text ting or listening music. Cellphone can be a big distraction for the student for to many reasons, sometimes students do not really think like that, but on my opinion it is a big distraction, using the cellphone during class can make you miss important parts from the class that you may need for a future test that maybe one of the answer can be that small part that you didnt hear because you were on your phone, but the teacher is not the responsible from your actions, you take your own decisions,and you choose the decision to look at your phone than pay attention at class. in other parts teachers should make that their rules for the classroom has appraisal, and make the students respect them, or if the teacher cant do that at least the school can make that rule. Some times youre just pretending that you are paying attention, but youre not really paying attention for the reason that you may be at your phone or answering a text, i am saying this because it happened to me and i do the same, i know some students has the same situation and others that cant live without their cellphone. it can be addictive. some times I think it can because the age, we are just young persons and some persons think different they really come to study but others just come because they have to. The effects of being using the cellphone at class are that you not really pay attention at class and you fail the class. cellphones are not necessary at class and its not educational or helpful for you to remained or learn things. On my person i fail classes because the same situation, i fail classes and if i fail classes ill fail the school year and then wont would like to repeat other school year. That gonna make me think about that and i dont would like to come to school because i feel like i loose my time coming to school to repeat it every single day. i think cellphone make you stupid and act like a dumb because when youre on your phone, you are like in other world, you dont pay attention on what is happening around you. you are loosing time from your life time that you can use study or do others necessary and important things for your life. i see students that they just dgf and they on their phone during class, im one of them, lol. On my opinion, cellphone can be necessary some times, but i dont really need it during class because i come to study, take notes and do my best in class for have good grades, i will say that cellphone can be use only during test, classwork because i am that kind of person that likes to be listening relax songs and doing my job. in other way schools gives you a laptop and i think the only thing where you can do all of those things is the computer, i can use Google or YouTube, its not necessary to have your phone on your hands. How can we solve this issue? teachers should collect all cellphones before start class, and make a rule that something gonna happen if he/she see someone with their phone, so students may have to respect this rule. All this conversation i think the problem is not cellphone, i think the problem is technology because humans are depending from technology and and it makes them fool, todays technology can be more smart than a person. if you really read to this side you should understand how is life now, you may be older and smarter than i am, but we both lived different generations, it is all my decisions, we have to control technology not technology has to control us. legalize ;)",6,6,6,6,6,5,313,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? In my position I think its a great idea to attend classes from home only if you work, or if you can handle any type of work by yourself without a person that will persuade you to do the work, and if you know English perfect. I think that some students will benefit from being able to attend classes from home. Because for some students its difficult to wake up early because some students who work on Part-times, and some students dont want to wake up early, or they go to bed late for playing games on their phones. Secondly. I think that some students might benefit from this program if they can handle any type of work independently without a teacher or any person persuading them to do the work, because some students are smart and they like to work independently, in silence, without people disturbing thems or without too much explanations. Also. I think that the only students that can understand any work and can only attend classes from home, are those who knows English Perfect, because if you know English perfect then you can work in any topic or subject without the help of anybody, If you are a Hispanic born in other country then this program it can work for some Hispanic students because they are used to get everything easy, to get what they want without making a effort. In the other hand, I think that this program it wont help to those students who distract easy or those who dont do work without any person who will persuade them to do the work, because there are students who likes everything easy, students who dont want to make an effort, this program it wont work to those students who dont like to study, to those who have only F on their classes or those who are skipping, or not going to school. In conclusion I think this program can only help those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person. and for those students who have dreams, those who makes a effort to get what it can help thems in the future, for those that knows that life its not easy, to those students that know that if you dont work for it you wont get what you want on life. those students who can handle any kind of work without the help of any person.",5,6,6,6,6,5,2406,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
335,3817,A79D997C4B42,"Working with a group has more benefits then working alone because with a group you can all help each other and learn new things, also so people can be more social and you can get the work done faster and aso there can be some pressure . When you work alone it can get very boring and you may need help with something but also if you are working alone you can work at your own pace. With a group you may be pressure to finish something quicker but your teamates can help you with that. When someone is in a group they can act silly at times and give the teacher or the boss a headache but, when they focus they can get work done faster. Working with a group is not just for the work, it is for people to be social and so people can see how they act around others. You can learn new things with other people that you did not already know or you can teach them something but at some point the whole group teaches everyone somehting new. Working in a group you would probaly be pressured to stop being foolish and get your part done but if you have nice teamates then someone can help you with your part. Some people, perfer to work alone because they do not like to be pressured for no reason but in some ocasions those people are the ones to turn in late work or has incorrect information. In a group they correct you if you did not do something right and hellp you out if you ask for help and someone can help you becuase thats what a group is for to help each other learn new things. If a due date is coming up there can be so much pressure because maybe you have not even done your part or you are just lazy to do it some your teamates start to get mad at you and you do not know what to do. Learning new things can be fun with a group because you might not be shy to ask questions so you learn new things and maybe someone else from your group learn that same thing as you. If the group learns something new then they can use that thing in the future when they work alone or with a different group. Helping each other is one of the easiest way to get done with something but working alone you may take longer because you have to search up things and some times they do not know where to start. Teachers put students in a group to see how they act around each other like if they act goofy or if they do not have self control. When working with a group there has to be self control because if the group is just being goofy then they would not get work done and they can get a bad grade and not work together in that class ever again. The teachers see how the students act and they see who should be with who and who should not be with someone. Working alone the teachers know that it will be quite and they would not know how the students act with friends around or a group. Working together is way better then working alone because you become more social and not so much of a shy person. A group can also help you focus and have a good time all at once, also they can hep with having a good grade in that class because they helped you a lot. Students learn new things when they working with people and they might not be so shy.

Cell phones are a safe thing for the students at this times. Some students dont have a way to search a subject or a problem because they dont have a computer with,so the cell phone is faster, and small easy to look through,share ideas with other students,point of view about a subject,political opinions,stay informed what is going on outside of school,students have to be informe about everything that happens outside of school,bloquing students devices can cause a bad effect and this will make then find other way to brake the rules again,and get what they want .I think students should be allowed to use cell phones for this reasons. However, some students can take to other side,and dont pay atenttion in class because of the cell phones,a big part use cell phones to play games,or get distracted with music,and this can affect a lot of other students in the class,use to much of the cell phones also affect the social midia.

I think working in groups is more beneficial and good for many reasons because; we collaborate and share ideas, it more fun and easy working together and get a chance to work with people we really dont talk to. and we also get our project or work done on time. Working in groups helps us by sharing ideas: i think working in groups is very important. it helps us bring our minds together to brainstorm some ideas or by sharing opinoin about the project or the assignment we are working on. we can discuss and make sure we understand and know the topic that we are working on. by doing this is a great thing because every person is contributing or participating in what we are working on. Secondly, We get everything organized and get our things done on time: working alone somethings is very terrible because i takes a while to finsh, you dont get it done on time and sometimes you might need help from somebody, which sucks but working in groups more quicker. since there is about atleast three or four people in the group. it makes it more faster to get it done on time. it makes it even more easier to get the assignment done by contributing and aslo, assigning or giving each and every person in the group a role to play or something to do to support the group in order to get it done on time. Lastly, another reason why working in groups is beneficial is because it is easy and fun working together and let us get a chance to work with some people you really dont talk to in school. Most people likes dont like to socialize with people they dont know so they choose to work alone. which is okay, but i think working as groups fun and easy. plus , it is very beneficial. I feel like working in groups is more fun. it makes us feel more free and more open to work together. when working with a group of people it is more fun because someone in the group may crack a joke or say something funny, it might cause a little bit of distraction but it brings laughter, smile, joy and happiness into our faces and that is what makes more fun and exciting to work together as a group. In conlcusion, it is more beneficial working in groups than working alone. In groups we share ideas, we finish on time before due date and it is more fun and easy to work together with people but not just by yourself. because in groups we disscuss and make sure everyone in the group understand before we start putting effort in what we are about to do. it is very important to work together in groups because it tells us that we should encourage ourselves and work together as a team. And by showing a team work, hardwork , support and determination makes a group work more successful. ",6,7,8,7,6,6,3559,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

343,3275,0EC392C06372,"Introduction: Author Ralph Waldo Emerson ""Unless you try to do something, beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". One thing that is really important in life is School because is the second place that we learn about how we can be respectful, responsible, honest and education. The second thing is Work- Independent because when we are always with our family is simple because we dont know how is the reality in the life. We were dependent but work include be prepare to have new experiences in our personal life and we are prepare to the future. The third thing is Life Cycle when we are baby, kids, teenagers, adults and older. The first is School (experiences) In our life school is important because teachers educate we and we learn of them about the classes like english when we travel to any country that speak this language we need to learn by process every day inside and outside the class because we improve with new topics like verbs, punctuation marks in school porcess. Teachers teach good values in our life like integrity, respectful, honest, responsible, service. For example, when we start to study we dont know how to write, read, paint, speak. They teach we everything like our parents at home. We decide when we grow up if we want graduate from the school,those values efforts, dedication, knowledge, good skills and new opportunities if we do everything correct inside and outside the school because we cant stop growing the opportunites that we can have is only one time in the life. Education is very important now in the present because if we go to school we are professionals and we can have good choices. Second is Work being independent in the life our parents work all the time because they want that we can have a good life, but when we go to work is interesting for example when we continue going to the school our parents cant give money all the time and we think like adults being independent, finding a job and learn about the life not is simple and is hard at the same time. Our future dependent if we want to think like adults or teenagers. We can be master helping other people that need our help those people will grateful with we because if we try to help each other we know everything from life experiences, when we go to school they pay better with a diploma from High School, College or University. Finally is Life Cycle when we are babies our parents teach we every process for example how to go to the restroom, brush our tooth, take a shower, speak, walk, eat for example when is the time for go to the dinning room. The time when we need go to sleep is relly important learn every little thing that our parents teach we when we are baby. We discovere a new stair that already we can be mastered. Kids for example after when we were baby in a simple thing we discovered new things, but being kids we continue in a easy way the life like speak, walk, eat, sleep, change our clothe not is difficult because we learn in the past, we try to do something beyond that we dont know before. Teenagers when we think that the life is hard going to the school, work, family, not is easy because is more responsability, efforts being stronger and continue doing those things is very different from the past. Adults is more difficult when we were baby, kids and teenagers because adults are charge of the family, work, pay, education, responsabilitys in the job and home. Adults are dependent because they learn the good things from the past for example when teenager want permission for go to any party adults really need to know what person is, where is from, the personality and who is her/his family, in any moment like that is really difficult to say yes or no. Adults are important in the society because they are master and grow from the Life Cycle. Older like grandmother and father they already know that grow not is easy but they did every step in a good form going the school, work - independent. Old people in sometimes need help from younger people like the family can be sister, brother, son, wife and daughter because they are tired and need space to relax like going to the park sharing with his/her family and friends. In this last thing if we try something different we can have a positive life. In conclusion: We can try being a better person in our life because every step is very important maybe in sometimes life is hard but if we learn in a correctly form everything like going to the school is a new experience, work - independent teach we being stronger and not be afraid, life cycle is the process from every step when we were baby, kids, teenagers, adultd and older. We grow every moment that can be easy or difficult. We need to be dependent to grow up, master everything helping other people in the world. I agree with the author because I know if we stop growing is very impossible to have new experiences in our life. Unless we try to do something different and intersting in our life we can a better chance to do good things can be in the present or in the future, for the new generation that can have good opportunities in school, job and with the society.

344,515,CA42D47C0914,"Would you like to act like someone else when your not? You should always be yourself nobody should ever tell u how to carry yourself. You ever heard of the quote,""Dont judge a book by its cover? I honestly believe in that. I was once a scrawny kid getting bullied cause of the way I carried myself and dressed. I never got the chance to get the shoes I wanted or the clothes so other kids who were on the football team would bully me. But little did they know i was the nicest and honest kid at Generic_School. In the year 2015 throughout 2018 I was someone I really wasnt. I was in the streets doing the opposite of what my mother showed me. Robbing people, fighting, breaking curfew, breaking into peoples cars. I was going through it because I was tired of people bullying me, I was tired of people emberrassing me infront of other kids. By the time I tried to get a job,all they woud do was look at me head to toe and say they arent looking for employees right now even though their was a help wanted sign out front. Even my moms friends would judge me on my looks just because I have tattoos and have a mean mugging face. I may have a bad background but that was me trying to be somebody im not, I was trying to fit in with the bullies, wiith the kids who used to bully me. Moral of the story is dont let nobody get to you and make you into something your not. I wish I could go back and prevent myself into being someone whom im not. My uncle got caught smuggling narcotics and is praying everyday he gets out. This all happened because he was trying to be someone he wasnt.

346,3812,A4CD4307D620,"Part of growing in this life is having the right type of mindset and skill you want for yourself only. The things I have learned in todays day is probably not really achievable because people give up to easy and think its hard to fix cars. I like to build and take apart engines or even add parts to get more potential out of any car I purchase. I love to race cars and also flip my money too. That all takes skill but you dont learn if your not taught in life. Likewise myself , for 11 years my father taught me how to use his tools and fix little things on any car he had at the moment. We would sell them and flip the money beacuse wed be the ones fixing them up a bit. When I got my very first car it had no motor in it and bought it for six hundred dollars. I myself bought the motor for a thousand and installed the whole thing by myself but yet with the right tools it was then worth five thousand because of how many miles the engine was and how clean the interior and exterior was. I would always becareful though when it came to turbo the engines. Youd need to hook a special computer on it to tune the compter of the engine so it doesnt blow up on you. Id love to race and compete against other peoples builds for money on the track. The best part of mastering this skill is that I will never need a mechanic to fix my own car again. Another skill I have become really good at is gaming and playing the fracnchise called Call of duty. These types of games are shooter games and it all depends on how fast your sensitivity is and how fast you can react to whatever is happening in the game. When it comes to gaming I like to post videos online of how good I am because I can also get paid through how many people watch my videos. Some people like the entertainment but more like to see how fast the reactions I have. That type of skill has helped me so much in life because it has always helped me make the right decsions when I am driving on the road even in school it has helped me remember and react a little faster then others in class. This skill improves everyday because its affected my everyday life. Through this Ive mastered to actually get through everday life without having such stress because I am always prepared to react and decide what is good for me. All in all I agree with Ralph Waldo he is right without trying something new you wont grow at all. The human brain is meant to be expanded and stretched like a muscle to learn new things like playing a sport , remembering equations in physics and solving over and over again and still getting logical answers , to be good at something takes practice , but to master whatever you want to master takes brilliance.

When you were a kid you had imagination it was with you when you were born, knowledge you have to learn. With imagination you can believe anything, new ideas are made with imagination, imagination is fun. You can believe anything you want with imagination. What is imagination? Its something you imagine for example an imaginary friend. Something not real but you see it no one else can see your imagination. You can make your brain think whatever you want you control it. You want to believe your touching a teddy bear, than you just imagine it and feel it. Our imagination is in our brains with us its something youre born with something only you can see it, feel it, and only you can imagine it. Ideas happen because of imagination you can think of new ideas for a movie or anything. Some people just have a bigger imagination then us but we all think unique. Everything we have in earth is because imagination happened. Those people think ""what do we need, what can help me."" First you gotta imagine it, then you have to believe, and finally you do it. Imagination is fun just let it take you where ever you want. its something youre born with not something you learn. Take vantage of it. Thats why i think Imagination is more important then knowledge.

348,2313,63C74FF7DB27,Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we dont undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals. The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant. Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping. In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant. ,4,4,4,4,4,5,1302,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 4, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

350,1809,2580A540719C,"Yes,I agree with the statement a positive attitude can always lead anyone to success.Positive attitude is the key to success dont lose hope even if you have lost everything. If you have a positive attitude and you work hard today or tomorrow you will become successful. If you have a positive attitude in a hard situation,you will feel like the situation is not hard and you will get over that situation. Positive attitude even helps you to maintain good heath and this will help you to get success. But if you have a negative attitude in a situation you might not get success in life. A positive attitude can will not only change your life but it can also help people close to you in achieving their goal because it will encourage them to become successful. 6 We can even take example of some successful people in the world like Steve Jobs who was forced to leave his own company but he always had a positive attitude,it doesnt matter what the situation was and 3 years later he bought his company back,not only that he had a heart disease and he was supposed to die but his will power and positiveness saved him. We can also take example of famous soccer player Christiano Ronaldo who was discriminated because of his color faced all of his hardships with a smile on his face he stayed positive in his whole life and now he is one of the greatest soccer player in the history. He just thought positve things in his life and overcame most of his hardships. In the modern world, if we even lose a small game we lose hope of winning again,but we have to change this thats not life works, everyone have hardships in their life but a smile on your face can make those hardships easy. Just think how to overcome that situation,instead of losing hope and stay positive. In the end,I would just say that everyone face hardships from a 1 year old kid to a old man but a staying positive can change the whole situation because you will be able to overcome anything.

352,3852,38452CB371C9,"Generic_Name Generic_Name 3rd period 11/08/2018 Former British prime minister Winston Churchill once said success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. you learn from your mistakes every time you fail in your live. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives. failing does not always mean it is the end of the world you have chances in life to keep trying hard . everyone has always an experience of failure in life nobody every succeeded without failing in their lives. First when you fail sometimes you get disappointed and say am never going to succeed in life but when you see the mistake you did the first time you try hard until you pass it. for example last year i failed my world history exam i was so disappointed that i did not want to retake again but our teacher gave me the paper back to see what i did wrong i saw that i did not read the question. from that day on i began reading my questions and i got the highest grade in class. i learned i should always read my questions before answering because if i do not read i will fail again and i did not want to retake the test again, when i read the question and i finally began to understand the question. i learned that i should always read my questions even if am in a hurry to go and it does not matter the situation reading a question is important. i learned that guessing is not good sometimes it results in failing, i should study the night before a test. Second a person should always learn how to study hard on everything you are given even if it is hard just try your best. last year when i gave my mum my world history final exam results she told me that i should try hard and she knows i can pass the test i told her that i will but am scared to take it again. my mum made sure that i studies every day and one day when i stayed after school for extra help. i also achieved passing this world history by trying my best to understand what the question is asking . paying attention in class also made me pass not only the final exam but also the class. when i passed this exam i was so excited because i studied hard to get at least a eighty nine on the final exam and i was also passing the class and i was understanding my work i was also on top of my assignments. Third failing something you took for the first time is not a bad thing it tell you that you need to keep working hard. for example one day i came back home crying and my mum asked what was wrong and i told her am still failing the world history exam. she told me that failing does not make me dumb it simply tells me that i need to correct my mistakes. she also told me that as a kid she also was failing her classes but she tried hard and hard and she now is very successful at wok. i also asked her how can i be successful? she told me that keep trying your best even if it is not your best accomplishment. she also told me that she would always be proud of me because she sees me working hard and trying to do my best. when i finally studied a lot and re-took the same test and passed it i was very proud of myself and said failure always leads to success. however, some people may say that failure does not play a big role in your life because there are other ways to suceed. you will always suceed anything in life withour failing, you do not need to work hard for what you want and you can always achieve everything as long as you do it. but they are wrong because failure is always the number one thing that leads people to sucess. failing leads you to try hard in life you learn from your mistakes. when you fail it does not mean it is the end of the world. you keep trying hard till you achieve what you want and studied hard for in life. failure leads to success and it is important for everyone to fail in life, failure plays an important role in our daily lives.",6,6,6,5,6,5,730,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

The way. I mean to buy the people its to do something from then and they will see if you are the best choses they can make or fro the country. Whent they see you trying to make the country better or fix something its bad they will take the best choese fro the country evenben you will do something to the country but you need to be the precident frist and you promese you will do it! the british naturalist this mean the just the naturalist is whent the people come from other country and they stay longer to be a cityssent this mean him will be have to naturalisation from him con from and the new country him staying after him is done with naturalist him can vote whent the coutry has fro vote for any reason like we saying buy and sale of gun on the street. that can be right to do it. the type of stuff you can give a opinion now after you naturalist they are many people on the wrold they mouve to the new country just beacuse the economi and the politicion. they looking better oportunit on life.

Its really beneficial to be with a group because of everyone collaborating. Working with a group makes the assignments to be completed in a easier and a faster way. Having a lot of people in a group means that everyone is going to be sharing their thought and ideas of how to complete the work in a easiest way. Working alone means that you have to work harder more responsibilities and also it will take you much more time to complete your assignments sense you are doing everything by yourself. Being with a group allows others to collaborate with each other that means that no matter how hard the assignments are all together are going to be able to complete it. Having a group guarantee you less responsibilities as well because you have others whom can do a different task from what you are doing. Also being with a group guarantee you to complete the work in much less time that if you were to do it alone. A group gives you better understanding of what you all have to complete do to everyone strong thought and ideas. Something really important in a group is the Lieder someone who is responsible to check if everyone in a groups is done with their assigned task. Also having a lieder will be easy to assign each one a task without everyone complaining about doing the work. You can also contact you lieder to inform him that is going to be impossible for you to complete your assigned task do to a problem with your family so that way a lieder can inform the others and find someone who can take you task and finish it, if you were alone you would not be able to complete that sense you wouldnt have anyone to depend on. A group guarantee you success when it became to complete any assignments do to everyone effort and sharing ideas, sure a lieder might be important but with a a group the lieder is nothing so everyone is really need in a group in order to successfully complete the work.

One reason why have a positive attitude, its beacuse if you give a positive attitude to one person, that person will be nice to you, and you going to receive all the things that you want, and like you want to be, and that person going to give you back the same attitude to you, that means that if you give a positive attitude you goint to receive a positive attitude.

363,2055,D0A5FF29C338,"First impression counts the most and its impossible to change. A person point of view on someone can never changed because of the many thoughts that go throught the mind, after getting to know that person because no one would want a friend like that. Having a serious face, not taking care of yourself and dressing wrong can lead to having a bad impressions, thats when people think of you in a different way and get things wrong that are not true,but due to the bad first imprsssions it change everything. Having a serious face all the time can mean lots of things, say for example youre life is horrible, your ready to go fight someone or it can mean I hate everything around me, thats not what makes a good first impression and it makes it impossible to change that. People now days dont want to be friends with someone who is always mad and is ready to fight someone, and because of that particular time you had serious face it led to you not having a girlfriend or a friend that was going to be with you for the rest of your life. First impressions can be hard to change and its impossible because once you had that one chance you waste it all due to that one serious face that everyone was intimidated and now people dont want to talk to you because all it wouldve took was a smile. Then,not taking care of yourself can make people not wanting to talk to you. Hygine can can change everything and lets people know about who you are and it makes people wanting to talk to you. Having a bad odor can lead to people running away,can make you look like you just dont care about yourself why would you care about others. Hygine is really important if you want to impress because otherwise it would make a bad impressions leading you not having friends or a girlfriend because no one wants to be around a person who smell bad and doesnt take care of themselves. The smilling comes in quick too, because you have a friendly convertion with people around you and people wnat to be your friends and it may not be because you dont smile. Your breath also counts becasue people like to have a conversation without having to smell what you ate for dinner or what you had for lunch, so is important to saty up with all those things beause people take notice of all those small things and the see that is woth talking to you. Therefore having the proper clothes for the proper time can change the way people look at you and it can make you have friends and be known for dressing good and people now days want friends who dress up good, for example is the homocoming dance and you go with your friends and youre wearing jeans and shirt and you have your friend all dress up for the occasion and theres you now no one wants to take a picture with you or dance with, dressing the proper way can make a difference on how people see you and is somehting that is a proven fact. When my satrted working as a chef people in the streets would see that her clothes would be all dirty with food stains it would make people think that they dont know how to cook and what is funny that she was making lots of money making food for important people and people was thinking of a different way when she was making more money than the people judging her, but when she started working as a nurse people would respect her for the way she was dress, eventhought she was not making the same amout of money, but people people saw her differently. Those all cahnges that you make in your clothes can make a difference and they dont have to be expensive of from a popular brand because all it is clothes is just how you use them and what makes it good that the clothes can be cheap but how you use them for the proper ocassion can make a difference. In conclusion having a serious face,not taking care of yourself and the way you dress up can make people have diffent thoughts of you. When being approche or even if they dont talk to you they will see that your not worth talking to and after they know who you are and your way of life style can make people hard to change that first impression of you. All this small things can chenge your life because I have been through those situatioins where people look at you differently and it makes it hard to change someones thought of you and that first impression that is important.

366,580,4A87CFC37238,"I believe that success comes from repeatedly failing but never losing interest on the task youre trying to accomplish. Trying to be successful in a certain task isnt something that can be done over night it requires extreme passion and patience, Certain scientist have been successful over time by failing but always getting back up on their feet and trying again hopefully to do things better. Scientist are driven by their enthusiasm over the life of science and what interesting things you could discover from studying it, their consistency of repeatedly failing and getting back up brought them a long way from nothing which eventually turned into something big for the society over time. For example Christiano Ronaldo the world famous soccer player, Christiano worked very hard to become who he is now which is a world class famous soccer player. Becoming a pro soccer player isnt something that can be done over a couple weeks you have to work your way from the bottom you have to be extremely good to get into a club with years worth of practicing also comes with a lot of failure by not being able to do certain tricks, certain passes, or shots its very difficult to perfect all those tricks or certain shots but that didnt stop Ronaldo from being the best. Soccer took multiple months of training and lots of failing and loosing matches for Ronaldo to get recognized after struggling and loosing Ronaldo eventually carried his team to multiple wins with tremendous skills, therefore soccer clubs came out to watch his games and soon he was offered a spot to play pro soccer, He worked his way up to becoming the best soccer player anyone has seen. Most people in the world think failing is a bad thing and eventually give up after time, because of the lack of passion they have towards their task so tend to give up and move on with another task. The majority of our society are becoming more and more lazy over time which leads them push away all their work away for another time, therefore its less of a chance for them to do bigger and better things in life like everyone wants. Some rappers, multi millionaires, and professional sports players became high school drop outs who worked at fast food places to get money to get through their day but they never gave up on what they loved the most regardless on how broke they were or how many problems they had they going on in their lives they never gave up on the thing they loved the most, they thought that one day they were gonna make it to the top and have a better life than they were living they never let go of that passion no matter how hard they had failed they always got back up and tried even harder than the last time. Eventually, all that sweat and hard work they had put into what they were passionate about they got recognized more everyday which made them want to do much more in life, be better person from what they were yesterday. Anyone can be successful if they really put effort into what their passionate about no matter how many times you tend to fail as long as youre enthusiastic enough about your task to keep moving on and doing better.",6,6,7,7,7,8,973,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
367,2352,A7CC5A46675A,"In my opinion, most of the students are finish with their corse classe already by their junior year. Therefore, I think that having the program in our high school can benefit us. Some ways that it can benefit us by preparing us to go to college, it gives us more time to be with our family during the weekday, and it gives us time to work. Preparing for college, can be very emotional and physically exausted. Some of the reason is that we are worring on which college we want to study or does your ""GPA"" is sufficient good that any college will accept us. One example I have about getting ready to go to college is that once upon a time, my big brother was going to college and his GPA was 2.9 he was so anxious because he couldnt get to any if the colleges that he really wanted to go to. He kept searchign for colleges that offered a basketball course and he had found out that our school had a program for basketball. As soon as he found out he signed up and was accepted real quick. Another reason, on which its good to have programs in our school is that we can actually spend more time with our family because we will be able to be at our house earlier. One time I was at school and my sister was in the hospital but I could not be at the hospital with her because I had three sols that week. Everyday when I got out of school she was already asleep and wouldnt wake-up until the next morning, she had neumonia so we could barely talk a litlle bit. My point is that if I or my brother had the choice to be in the program we couldve be with our sister because we wouldve been out at 1:30pm. My last reason, is that having a program also helps us to have more time in the afternoon to work and help our family with families with their bills and their needs. We can also, save money for our college and for our selfs too. In my opinon, we have to work hard to get what we want, and what ever is that we are working for, will come with lots of blessings. In conclusion, we should have a program in our school so that we can grow more as professionals and have more responsabilties. We can prepare for college, be with our family, and work while we are in the program. Also, we can helps those who are still in ninth, tenth, or eleventh grade accompish their goals same way as we did but, we have to be thankful with those who helped us reached our goals.

368,219,7BBB35F9D1BD,"If I had to take a side I think I would disagree. One reason is that you cant always have success ,theres times where somethings dont work out. Then theres failure and thats how you have success in anything from learning from your failure But there is time where when you fail and your enthusiasm is gone because of that. The one reason I agree is because theres time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will its part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down. The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again thats will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again. So when you fail and fail again you will away lose enthusiasm because you just cant get it. So if I had to pick a side I would disagree because you cant just fail and fail and then have success and not lose enthusiasm.

369,3528,BBB9D66F934C,So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School. Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen. So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50 chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year,5,5,6,5,6,5,2530,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

371,2536,D948703E8026,"Should the city council adoption the curfew of a 10 p. m weekday and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers? You often hear people say that teenagers are costing more problem to other people and for the around them environment. The city council should adoption the 10 p. m midnight curfew for teenagers because teens would stay out of problems, and they would have more time to do school work. To start, the curfew would avoid teenagers being in problem with the law. For example,teens with the curfew would not be in gangs or cost problem to others. Lets say that teens had the curfew it would expand beyond the level of doing good to others and staying out of gangs or doing bad stuff. They would be able to achieve their goals fast and force on what is next in life. Even though, this curfew sounds bad its not bad because teens would learn that the curfew is just to help them and help the environment around them. Secondly, the curfew would allow teens with more time on their schools work and have time to force on their work. For example, teens would have more time to focus on their schools work than being on the streets with gangs. With that being said teens would have a chance of achieving their dreams and being successful in live without a bad influences. In this scenario, it show that a curfew is not bad because it has some good way in live and it allow people to do good stuff for others. Ultimately, with this curfew it allows young people to see the better side in life and it would help them to stay focus in schools by achieving their work and doing the right things. Some people may say that having a curfew is unfairly interfere in young people lives. For example, young people have the right to choose the way they want to be. Therefor, being later in night dose not meant that young people are doing bad stuff or their are in gangs also they are just having fun in their way. Thus, being in a curfew it show young people that their are controlling by other people just because they have a different way of having fun. In this scenario, it show that having a curfew is just unfairly for teenagers just because other teens got in trouble it dose not means that all of the young people needs to have a curfew. In conclusion, the city council would just being helpful to the young people by add a time limit. And it would help the environment around them and it would give more time and focus to the young people. All in all, it is a good thing to put a curfew because teens would have more time to spent with their family and doing good stuff for the environment.

372,568,58567312BDAB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attent classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need it, and students would not participate in class activies or projects. Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends. For example, in the school students would know different types of people, races,and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate in class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, in the school, students can work in groups projects, expositions, and activies. Moreover, when students work in groups, they can learn how other students work, the tecniques that they use and skill that they have. In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation. Also, some students have jobs and other responsablities. In conclusion, some students would not benefit from taking classes online from home becasue, they would not have a social communication, they would not ask question os ask for help, and they would not participate in class activies.",7,8,6,7,8,8,1141,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

People also think that it is a bad idea graduate from high school in three years because they said that is to early, and you dont going to be smart enough to be successful in life but I said "" thats wrong because we still have to go to summer school and take extra classes in summer school and you have to be very smart because you need to pass all you classes you cannot fail any class because if you fail one you need to take it in summer school again and thats going to be a problem so if you want to graduate early you also have to take classes online so youre going to be very busy so they should be ready for the next level. I know someone that he is from Dominican Republic but he leaves in Generic_City, I went to one of his barbershop and i ask him "" what did you do to be so successful? he told me this "" when i was 16 years old I graduate from high school then i ask ""how you graduate so early and he told me that he take classes in summer school and he take classes online"" i said that s good ""keep telling me how you became succesfull "" and he told me that after he graduate he went to college to take classes the barbershop 3 years later he was only 19 years old so he have to work for one year if he want to open his own busyness then after that he open three barbershops in Generic_City he said if you put you best effort to the thing you, and life going to get better everything. Another thing is that not everybody make it, is hard but i have i tip for those type of people never give up just do you best and put you hurt to it and put you best effort because at the and your mom and dad dont going to be there to pay for you food you going to be the man in that house so thats why everybody need to work hard everyday if they one to be successful in life. In conclusion the best thing for student in graduate early because the must experience you get doing something the must money you going make and for me life is about perseverance, progress, and be successful because if you don got nothing nobody going to respect you, and you need to help the people that cannot make it because people fail sometime life is not that easy for some people is you got the opportunity to do it good in life take that opportunity.

375,745,F9069F051AD1,"I think an enjoyable educational activity for me is Gym. Because gym is the most fun class I have this year these are some examples of why I like gym. the first reason why I like gym is because during the warm up we are aloud to talk to our friends while we are walking. Also another reason why is when we finish doing our warm up we get to play games or do fun activities. the last reason why is we could also go outside to do games or activities when it is nice outside. The first reason why I enjoy the beginning of gym is because you can walk around the gym and talk to your friends. . And not have to wait to talk till lunch to talk all you want. But the main reason why I like that part of gym is because I love to talk even though at sometimes I got nothing to talk about. Another reason why is that I love hanging out with my friends or to hear about there problems. talking helps you feel much better and lonely so i think that talking is fun and important at the same time. then the other reason why I like gym is because we get to play fun games or activities sometimes. Because I like getting distracted from stuff with something fun like a game or activities. The fun games could help someone feel relaxed and forget about something that might be worrying them. another reason why I like that is because l think it is much more fun than having to be in health, Doing the pacer or doing push ups. But other people do enjoy those stuff but I highly dislike doing those things. but the games could help you get some exercise and keep you having fun the gym class instead of being bored and exercising The last and final reason why I like gym is because sometimes we go outside when the weather is nice to do activities or other stuff like that. I like going outside because I like it when it is nice and warm out to be doing exercise. It is also nice to be out there and be racing or playing soccer and maybe football. But it is also big outside to be holding all of the gym classes together and the teachers could teach together. And you could also do much more outside even though some people dont like going outside I think it is much better because their is much more space and more fresh air.",8,6,7,6,7,6,3742,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

And also it is respectful to be honest and if its your friend or family I think you should be honest because its your friend and they probably wouldnt care what you say if its mean because they probably know that you dont mean to be mean and that your just being honest with them. But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit. But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them. In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not.

Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying. When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day. Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much youll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything youve been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because Ive been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home Id play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life. Some people dont like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts. In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that youll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal.

You should have the freedom to make choices for yourself and have independence of action and thought. Although pleasing loved ones and being like everyone else in a collective identity can set a moral behavior or have good personal characteristics by which an individual is recognizable as a member of a group; like a sense of belonging. It also feels good when collective aspects of the communitiess characteristics; like values or common interests by which something is distinctly recognizable or known and is indivisible to the individual and so you start to feel proud of your community, much like patriotism or nationalism. But you should have the freedom to instinctively or consistently question your community if it contains fundamental errors in reasoning. For example a principle, belief, idea, or opinion of a collective or persons authority that is considered to be absolute truth is dogma. You should also be sometimes skeptical of the advice of youre friends and family members as well because they could mistakenly give you the wrong opinion about a course of action but you should still listen and have trust in them on everything else.

By studying coarses in High-school it will teach students the requirements for specific careers and prepare students for college and thier career if not required for college after High-school. Having career coarses will make students more confident and comfortable in thier first year in college or thier first day at work becasue students will already be knowledgeable about what thier doing, and it will also give students a headstart in life and which makes students well prepared. Having career coarses will give a variety of choices for students and will help them figure out what they might want to study. These coarses will teach students requirements, basics, and will give them an idea of what they might want to study in college or a career after High-school. When students are getting ready to leave High-school some students still might not know what to study, but having career coarses would solve that solution easily which will cause less depression and stress. There are four years in High-school which is enough time for students to switch out of a career coarse if thier arent intrested. If High-schools dont take advantage of this idea students will be pure pressured to go to college and study a random coarse which isnt right if thier not intrested, that could lead them to drop out of college and waste thousands of dollars and could maybe go in debt for the rest of thier lives. Career coarses In High-school will give students headstarts which is very beneficial for students and professors in college. College professors wont have to teach the basics, but will go over them which would save time and this also means students will have a couple of extra time for tests and final exams.

After religous beliefs school is the second most important thing in the world. These students are our future and we want the world to be a better place and have a better society. We should reach out to the school board and colleges and let them know, By emailing, calling, or just by using social media that this is a very important matter and it would be very benefical for both them and us as students, We want to suceed and be educated and having career coarses is the best way possible, we dont want to go in debt for the rest of our lives for something we didnt enjoy doing in college we want to be well prepared and every student should have equal opportunities in the world to know what to study.

If a student is stuck on what he wants to do in life the businesses can help them see what they want for their future. Students should have partnerships because students can get more skills about that job, students learn more about the job their going for, and student can see if that the job they really want to be in. First, students can get more skills about there job because they are in the business hands they can go around learning on how they do everything. They also get to see how the company is ran and how they handle business. Student can learn a lot we it comes to the business if the company shows them about it. If the company helps the students then the students are going to want to take classes about it. Their going to want to go to the Tech center about it their going to want to learn more. Second, is that they learn more about the business by going to the company. They learn how to control the mechanical stuff over at the company. They will learn about the paper work over there.

384,2916,15968BD9B40A,"Some schools have programs where younger students can work with older students. For example, At my school theres homework club right after school. Teachers of all sort of subjects come to the libary and help out with your questions. The teachers also let you communicate with any grade level students. So I think that students of all ages should interact with each other. So I think it can help younger students understand if they cant capture the meaning or they need an older student to clarify for them. Because younger students look up to the older students. Meaning that when there the oldest in the school or one of the oldest, they can help out kids/students who need help and use the same strategy that the older student tought them when they were younger. So then, the younger students would always wanna go to the programs that the older students go to for some help. It benefits for the older students because, For example, If one of the students wanted to become a teacher and is really shy, Then they can work on their communication skills on the younger students and become more secure about them selves and become a teacher. For example, When they were teaching they young ones, they could use that exact same stragety when they were ""teaching"" when they were young. It defenitly can help both because, It can help with communitcation skills and meet new people youve never meet i your life, And then later on in the future youll become really good friends with them. This can help out a lot not only one way but a lot, Because if youre the young one then you still have a long way to go. And if youre the older one then if you thought you can pursue your teaching carrear then you still have a chance to be a teacher in life. In conclusion, My essay was yes. Why? Because some younger students parents didnt go to school, or finished school. So they have no one to ask for help. But this isnt only for homework club, this can be for any activty or program theres in the school. It can be sports,cooking, teaching, ect. For example, If you played a sport and you were the youngest, you can ask the oldest for help. Like how can i improve my skills, or how can i improve my passes, ect.

385,372,B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isnt a great idea. The reason why I think it isnt a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school. First reason why I think it isnt a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didnt have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isnt enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed. Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, its the only time a student doesnt have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college. Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast. In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isnt a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

I will do my best to make those students successful. You should announce this program to the whole school so many people can participate. We need as much students as possible. Helping people is one of my hobbies. We can also provide different interesting stuff that students can do during tutoring time. We can provide sports and other things that they want. We can make it as an after school program. We should also provide buses to people that are going to stay. Mr. Principal let me handle this program and make it ready for all students. We should do our best to help those kids. Parents can also help. You can also ask for donations.

387,3471,3691B4714FD5,"Conserving energy and resources, this is what the most part of the society is worried about, some bussineses are even adopting a four-day work week, each day consisting of ten hours; but should schools apply this model by extending the school day two hours? Well, I belive that schools should adopt this model because: It gives students a longer weekend to vacation, or simply to their favorite activities, second reason would be learning part, students will have a longer period of time for each class, which means they can learn farter, or memorize it easier; then we have the most important; the resources and energy saving. Almost every student loves to have a loger weekend, one example could be my neightbor Generic_Name; he loves to go camping on weekends, sometimes he tells me, he wish to have a longer weekend, that would allow him to go even further or simply to stay loger at the same place, I am pretty sure that the three days weekend would make him happy, others may also be thankful, because they will have more time to do their homework or just to study. Me, as an example, I rather to stays at home and study; sometimes, I feel like the weekend went off a lot faster than the usually. The second reason, which is so important for students, I belive it is; the longer classes that we will have, this will make a great impact on the grades of the students, longer classes will make us learn quicklier,Generic_Name my brother is one of those student that forget some important things about any class, I always tell him, ""Generic_Name study, do your homework,"" and he has already forgotten what the homework was about, I belive Generic_Name will get better and remember the homework with the loger period of classes; also in my class of science, sometimes the whole class is experimenting with some wird liquids, and we are still mixing when, the bell rings, my theacher, Generic_Name, says, ""it would be greatful, if we would have more time so we would be able to finish the experiments,"" and of course! the entire classe agree with what he says. Some people might say that students would forget somethings during weekend, however the four-day school week will help to conserve energy and resources; there is a massive wave of air polution in this world, and one of the biggest is fosil fuel, millions of kids are dropped to school by their parents, if we start coming to school a day less; it would casue a great impact over the polution, it could reduce polution a lot, also the government will save a lot of money in terms of food sources, every day, schools give tons of food just for students, a non-classes friday could help to save that much resources. As a conclusion, I belive schools should adopt this four-day school week because; it will make students to enjoy the new schedule, the three-days weekend, this will give more time to do our favorite activities or to study. It will also give us longer classes, where we could have bigger activities without being worry about the time, at least not as much as before, but it will be enough, and my last one which I belive the most important, society will have less air polution, and also the the government will save a lot of money if we get the four-day schoool.",8,7,8,7,7,6,710,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

I had to do 120 hours of community service. At first i thought it would be boring but a few days later it was fun. I had to do 120 because me and other friends did trespassing at SCHOOL_NAME. It kinda sucks because i had to go to court and my mom and dad were mad because they had to pay 200 dollars for the ticket. That wasnt cool!! Well the next day i went that same school and they told me that i couldnt be there at all! and they also said that if they see me there at that same school they would call the police on me again. Thats why you shouldnt drive fast or pass red lights because they would double the money. Now i noe not to go to that school again.

First, the student have more freedom of concentrate in the home that school because student not have noisy peoples, student work more quickly and have interests in the class. The corporation a student of regular school and home student, in the regular school have lass time in the class and home have more time and focus in the class. Second, some student cannot go to the school for problem in the health or is sick of a illness. Today al the peoples can student and learn for class online or video conferencing, student with problem can learn and study like other student from regular school. Finally, other people have responsibility in the class like the job because some not have time for go to the school and work all the day and only have time after work in the night.

390,578,09ADB0629CD0,"Benefits of attending public schools Imagine a child or student taking classes at home. How would his or her parents feel? Would home school be helpful for their child? Is homeschooling important for thier child than public schools? Students would benefit to attend classes in school rather than attending class at home because students can become active, getting enough information, and having the ability to share ideas. Attending public schools can persuade students to become active. Teachers can also persuade students to become active as well. Teachers wants students to have fun. For an example, physical education, or for short PE. It is a program in school for children to have exercise and training. Teachers would allow students to play inside or outside. Even if students do not want to participate. Not only schools let students become active in class, but also offers information to students who need help. Getting information can help students to become better at understanding things that students learned in school. It is important to know why students want to learn. For an example, students staying after school for help. Staying after school can help students study for a test. If a student needs help or needs more information, do not be afraid to ask for help. A teacher will be there to help you. Teachers can give their best to answer students questions. Not only schools can persuade students to become active and offers information to students, but also shares ideas. Sharing ideas can help students as well. Students can share their ideas other students. For an example, completing assignments in a group. Students love being with partners or group to solve problems. Students would listen to others students opinion or debate and see if they agree or disagree. It is always helpful to be with a group and not be alone by yourself. In public schools, students can become active, can get information that they need, and let students share their ideas. That is why it is important for children to go to school. Home schools are different than public schools. Home schools can be very challenging for some students. A student working alone with no partner, not being active, and not getting enough information from parents. Imagine a student being in that position. How would she or he feel? Public schools would be the best option for children. Imagine if every student went to school, their would be a positive change in their future.

391,2331,D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"". Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didnt like or didnt want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldnt have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they? Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but wont read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what youre ordering comes with. Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because theyre hurting badly and doctors will say youre perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you dont need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist dont believe in that but most do. So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes dont know what theyre doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",7,7,8,7,6,6,2887,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

393,2661,FE3CA06DDCA1,Why is it when someone asks you for advice there the ones talking most of the time? Here are 2 of the reasons I think that the person who asks for advice talks more than the one who is giving the advice. Reason 1 is they might want to give the on who is giving the advice all the info so then they can help them. Reason 2 is that they are give you as much detail as they have to give you good advice. They will want to give you all the information so you can probably find a solution or fix to there problem. As in this sit ions where my friend needed some advice for a test she had coming up. She was not sure what to do to study for it. She was telling me what she had to study but then she said I dont think these would help me much I told her to make flash cards out of the note she had then she did that. She was super stress. I think when your stressed you just say things that are on your mind as in you talk more. If a person wants good advice they will want to give you all the details. If you know all the details you will most likely know how t fix it. Everyone needs so good advice because the how are they going to fix there problem. If you friend has a problem and they dont tel you all the details your not really gonna give then good advice. In conclusion why you need advice you will talk more then the person who is given you the advice. When you are in a problematic event you will take a lot more because yo will be most likely stressed. Also if you give all the the details of your problem you will get good advice. ,6,5,6,6,5,5,3861,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
394,2535,A1196779A15B,"Do I think we choose our traits? In this world people choose their pathway. What they want to be in life. What career they want to do in the future. Some people have not figure out what they want to do in their life. It is always up to yourself to make life choices and some people like to listen to other people ideas but not listen to themselves. Humans like to listen to their friends or family members ideas too see if they can help them out. I think people like to listen to others people ideas but their own idea which is showing they can not make their choices by themselves. Many of the humans depend on their friends or family being their to help them out. Being part of this life is learning how to make choices by yourselves and going out in the world and making yourselves an adult. Kids that turn sixteen start looking for jobs so they can grow and see how the money and dealing with customers works. When I turn sixteens years old I went out to look for jobs i wanted that feeling where I could earn money. People would make fun of me for working at a thrift store. At that time I cared what people would say about me and I told my manger that the job was not for me. I would listen to people comments but it was not worth it because they are not going to be there in the future. The point is we let people make our choices when we can do it ourselves but we like to depend on others. Some people can feel like the world make their choices. Someone who you do not know about can judge you for no reason. Some people feel like they have to make everyone happy but not make themselves happy. When it comes on choosing who will be our next president not a lot of people like to tell others who they will vote for because there is always a person who will say something about it. There was a time when I was in my government class and a student asked what i thought about our president and his issues. I told him how i felt and instead of telling that he agreeing with me he told me how wrong I am and I did not know anything about the issues and how the president is trying to slow it. It can always be a person who you do not know trying to make your choices. Even though sometimes we make our mistakes however I feel like we depend on others When it comes to make out choice we like to learn from experience we been through. We like too watch other people do it or we like to do it ourselves. I think it happened too be before when I thought I was doing it the right way and I would look around my classroom and I would see the other students doing it differently. By the end of the class the teacher got all of us in trouble because we did it the wrong. I should have asked the teacher or kept doing how I was doing it before. I feel like some people do not have the confident in themselves. I think that is right because sometimes I over think about something that is not a big deal. In this world we do not like to do our things. We like people choosing for us, making decisions for us, and depending on others. Some people take time to figure out their life and who they want too be in life. I think we like to depend on other people ideas and not listen to ourselves. Living in this world is always about making choices and living by those choices. Do not have to listen what other people say about what you think and how you should live your life.

395,3734,B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion. First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are. Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school dont go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesnt have money to pay for college/university or who doesnt want to be dependent to his family. Some families dont have money to pay their childrens school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly. Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed. In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students.

397,2305,D760EF65B80C,"Many people think that it is a great idea for high school students to only attend three years of high school education, by taking courses in the summer or in the evenings, It will allows you to graduate a year earlier than your orginal class year, I prefer to attend all four years of high school education, which means that i would attend all four traditional years of high school education, such as: Freshmen year, Sophmore year, Junior year, and Senior year, which is the last year of a student high school education. The reasons for my disagreement are: Age problems, Graduation issues, Lack of Experience, and Shortage of a summer break. Firstly, lets talk about age problems that people who follows this plan are going to go throught. Freshmen students should be starting thier first year of thier high school career around the age of fourteen or fifteen years old, So they can graduate while turning the legal age of eighteen years old in the United States, Which is the correct age of finishing thier high school education. Sophmore students should be starting thier Sophmore year while turning the age of sixteen years old. There are few students that start thier Sophmore year at the age of fifteen years old, Which means that they attended thier first grade in Elementry school younger than others. Secondly, Graduation issues, Graduation should be the most significant accomplishment in anyones high school education, When following this program, You are not going to be able to graduate with the same class year as you for example; I graduate with my orginal class of year twenty-twenty. If following this program, you are going to be ahead of your friends and class year. Thirdly, Shortage of summer, students only get two months as a summer break in the United States, before attending thier next school year. By following this program, you are not going to be able to go on vications and rest from the year that you attended. You must study the classes and cources that the program gives you, so you can finish all of your credits and graduate while your family are on vications having a good time. Finally, In conclusion, this program will mess up your summer plans and would not benefit you with any new progress.

Students are used to online stuff like, web browsing, gaming, and etc. which gives them an extra advantage already. They would be more successful using online browsing. Video conferencing is another way of distant learning; this would let the teachers talk to students in case they need help. People has been using video conferencing to even take tests at home. Distant learning would also help them have success in education socially. If students are to stay at home to learn, they would feel more comfortable around somewhere they been for a long time. They could ask people, family members who they are comfortable with, for help if they wanted to. They would be more fit and ready than going to school considering that you have to wake up early in the morning, get ready and walk to school.

Also, sometimes we take our family advice, they tried to persuade our character by doing incorrect things. In others words we can said that they just want to influences our self because they ready pass for al this things that is good because we can see how much love they have to us. Is wonderful when your mom tell you the she cant believe that way the you get influences because sometimes we dont want to get they advice but all that they said is correct event if we dont want to believe then. For example my parent always want the betters things to me but i know if i dont try to fix my character I going to have less opportunities to have a better job or a better future.

Also my mom help me to change my character in my way to act because went sometimes people tell me things the I really dont like I do bad faces to then, I was doing bad with that. In other way, we dont think in the consequences of having a bad character, sometimes we dont think if others are going to see the actions in our lives and they maybe are going to influences you but no we the same attitude, because some people have bad attitude to but all the influences help you in life because if you dont like the people act with a bad attitude you dont have to be like that to. Also, you have to be prepared to make the decisions of what changes you are going to make. Having a good character gives you large of opportunities people always is looking for person with a good character,because costumer look the.

In other hand we have to feel free in what we want to do we know what we need to change we dont have to do what others want because sometimes they just look for they benefits what is better for then and that dont have to be like that.

402,2195,925DBAC486E5,"Have you ever thought about finishing high school early? Not every student wants to finish school in four years. The reasons high school students would want to do this is to reach their career early or they have personal matters that make them want to leave early. To some teens going through with the program could be a difficult task. It is a good idea for teens to take the three year program, because they are trying to accomplish their goals early. Not all teens want to spend all four years of high school. Their reason could want to move on to college after those three years. Another reason to why students want to finish is because they could have problems at their school. High school has bullying and other issues that could leave them with no choice but to want to take the three year program. There are teens in high school that want to join the work force at a young age. The three year program has a lot of good benefits for students, but its not an easy thing to do. Students would have to take extra classes, which means more work. This would mean students will have to take extra math, science, history, and english classes. For the electives the students would probably have to switch them out with core classes. For highschool teens who do this program would have no time to slack off and would have to work had achieve their goal of finishing in three year. In the three year program you are given choices on how you would like to do youre work. There are schools that could let you take the program through online. Students could also have the choice of taking the work over the summer right after school goes on break. High schools that have this program are giving students a huge benefit. it is a good idea for teen s that are taking a three year program to advance quicker to their future goals.",6,8,7,7,7,7,1940,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

You can have fun,you can work and meet with different persons,and you can learn more about the subject. First of all I think It will be fun couplet a science experiment because I like sciences and I can learn more about experiment. Also I love going to my sciences class when we do experiments because It fun. I always laugh when I do experiment and they dont work. Another thing that I think sciences is fun is because you never know if the experiment will be work. One day me and my little cause we did smile in the kitchen and my mom gets mad and she make me clean the whole kitchen but, then we did smile in school and I already knew how to do it. Secondly when you are doing a science experiment You always have to work in groups sometimes with your friends sometimes not. For me its cool to work with different persons because when you do not know something and you ask them and they know they will help you and thats why for me is enjoyable to do sciences experiments because Im a friendly person. One day in my sciences class we were doing an experiment then a new student came and the teacher ask me if I could help him and I said yes because he just knew Spanish and I help him and we became friend. Then doing a sciences experiment it not just to have fun is to learn more about the subject that you are learning because is no the same doing the experiment then just listing to the teacher explaining. A lot of time this has happen to me that Im listing to the teacher but I dont understand nothing but when we do the experiment I do understand. In conclusion for me completing a sciences experiment is one of the my favorite things because we dont just learn we have fun and thats why I like it. Also to complete a sciences experiment you do different things you dont just stay sit you move around. At the being of the year I didt speak to much English and it was hard to understand the teacher but when we start doing experiment it was more easy and now I understand more and that make me feel happy and that one of the reason I enjoy doing experiments.",6,6,5,5,5,6,364,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Maybe you wanna buy a car and some how the car doesnt work you gotta talk to the dealer ship about the car.

408,366,73234AB62383,"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them . Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they dont go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day. Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they dont have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day. In my opinion I feel like we shouldnt add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we wont be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work.

409,1805,8DF5D7CF4085,"Everywhere you go, everyone or at least someone makes a plan for their future reference or goal. Many people dont have the time to accomplish their goal and others have. Everyone has a way to achieve or succeed in something they like. Others like to stay idle or not tend to move to achieve their goal. And other people like to do something to accomplish their goal. Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle....it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" I totally agree to Thomas Jeffersons statement that, we accomplish more if we are doing something. To start with, doing something can help you plan, achieve, or complete your future goal quicker. For example, When you are given a task to complete you cant sit there idle to wait for someone to help you or wait for a magic to happen to complete your goal. If you want to graduate from high school and get to college with a scholarship, you will have to study hard to get to college. If you want to get a great permanent job, you still have to study hard and have a good resume. This will make you be faster with every work you be given to complete. Furthermore, doing something always makes you more active. For instance, when you fail an exam or possibly one or too many of them, you cant possibly say that you do not care about your score, you have to take action, study hard, and hope for the next exams you would make it to the top. Whenever I fail a text, even though I dont like to retake a text, I prepare for the next text we are going to have for the next unit and for all the rest unit we are going to learn. I like to learn ahead of the class because am not really smart to learn in class so instead I learn and prepare ahead in class. Planning and taking notes in class or anywhere else can make you tend to do something than to sit there idle to plan your future. Making plans for the future helps you achieve or accomplish your goal. On the other hand, many people often argue that staying idle to achieve your goal will make you less stressful. They say that because people want to achieve their goal by doing something, they often take pills that will make them stay awake especially for the high schoolers. They say this because most high schoolers wants to achieve more, graduate and get a better college and a great permanent job so they put all their might into studying and drinking and taking pills to stay awake and some student often get sick but cant stop cause they have been addicted to it. Although this may be valid, but doing something always makes you great and achieve your future goals and helps you to be more responsible in the future because in the future it will be easy for you to get a job and mostly half of every job will ask whether you have an experience or you being qualified for the job. And you probably dont know whats going to happen in the future so you to be prepared and planned for the future. In a nutshell, I like to plan my future goals and learn ahead of my class. Completing an action all the time will forever make you involve in important duties. It also helps you discover more. It can also help you improve in your studies and make you a successful person in the future. It will make you useful in your workplace. Many teachers and other colleagues will admire and respect you and you can even turn out to be their model. You can get the college you have been always dreaming of and accomplish all your personal goals. ",9,7,7,8,7,8,1883,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
410,3581,E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you wont grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing? First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldnt you want to challenge yourself with new things? Its good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things. Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You cant master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good. Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be. However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you dont work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you dont do that than you would struggle a lot in life. In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and dont want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because youre going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldnt it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",8,6,7,7,7,7,3396,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

412,1998,59981B992996,"My first paragraph is , I think that some schools offer distance learning, for students because if they dont want to attend to school in the morning ; for example they can take that classes online, the classes that they miss the day they are out of the school . Students would be benefit from being able to attend classes from home, because if they are in High School and if they are in 12 grade , and they need some classes to pass they can take online that classes . Because if they dont pass that classes they are going to lose the year in High School , and all the students they are not going to graduated. My second paragraph is , what I think is if schools offer classes online and/or video conferencing , to the students that means that they really want to help students when they dont attent to school. For instance ; that schools are really good they need to help all students that they need some help , if they offer that classes online is because they want all the students to work hard every single day at home or anywhere, they wanted to work on those classes online , and if you take classes online you can take notes to help you when you have to take a quiz about what you read and what you know. If students deside to go school , they can take all the classes that they want to take . They can take in the school were they went but; if they dont want to take classes online its doest matter what they want to do if they work from home by the way online , they can work in the school if they want or at home if they wanted to work really hard without any reason and if you get good grades on that classes and you understand everything you can pass that classes. That schools give us a oportunity to work on classes online , if we want to work with others classes that we dont have yet . For example , if you at home dont have any internet , what you can do is if you want classes online you can go to the library and work on those classes there , you are not going to pay nothing if you work on that classes , they give you free that classes thats why the schools give you that option to you and for all the students if you are a smart student and you study really hard , you can finish that clases in less than a moth but if you study hard every day at home or at school that can help you.

Bacuse fialling in life is not that easy for same people.

Even thought in school you cant keep failing. I also agree with Churchills satement becuase you cant just success in life without trying becuase life is evry hard to success in it. and if you wants to be success you really have to try in life, theres so many people in life that dont have job,place to sleep or food to eat becuase they did not success in life.

415,475,800FE9615C63,"The misnister of Wilnston churchill, he say that success in life or anyother things, theres a failure and dont lose enthusiasm because of that litlle things or because you fail one time in your try. I agree with the minister churchill say because succsee its a way to improve your skills or be betther in what you did and you try to not haves more make mistakes annymore, success can have failure but also you can lern for them, and learn how to rersolve your pronlemsand see how far you can go by trying, how you can have more expiriense by traying and traying again and again, no making mistakes annymore so the next time you dont have the same mistakes or pronblems because you larn about it. I think with success you can learn a lot of experiance in your life, because with your failure you learn about it, because if you leave it like that you not trying and you are not exploing your self, so if you exploit your self you can see how far you can go to resolve the problems or the mistake you have. So if you explod your self trying more and more you can maybe resolve the problem or see how far you can go to find a solution, the thing is if you keep trying your best in somthing you dont know exacly what it is or how to resolve it in many times you can find a solution and fix it. failure is not you are not going to resolve it because if you are doing your best but you keep failure is becuase you need to find the problem you are not seeing, to resolve it failuture is not because is not working success is because you didnt find the solution at your problem. For my conclusion for success you have to pass for a lot of problems and mistakes so you can find a solution for it, in your life if you dont explow your self you wont know what was the problem to that but if you explow your self you can find the solution and also learn from that, trying hard and hard moust of the times you can find a solution for evryting and that is how you also you can help others with they problems like when they say two heads is better then one.",4,4,6,4,5,4,1685,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
416,3592,F3259CFA6566,"Being yourself brings out the better you in a person. When you are yourself your a better person because your not changing yourself to be someone your not. Sometimes its good to change in your life but dont loose the way you are to be someone worse because your attitude and personality is what stands out the most in you. Most people change because they want to be a better person or they are tired of being so quiet and keep to themselves. The way someone is shows the kind of person you are and to try to change back to the person your not anymore could be difficult because you are changing your ways as a person. Firstly; being yourself means you are unique in your own way. You dont have to change yourself to prove a point to someone. No matter how mean, rude, disrespectful you are you cant really change the reason I say that is because that is how you are already as a person. Most changes can occur maybe from someone loosing another person like they passed away and it hurts you so much you loose yourself as a person. Changes can reflect you as to what goes on in your life. Like maybe you suffer from abuse, violent actions, or even depression that can change you as a person. Just by being yourself and pushing yourself to change can be such a big change in your life even maybe to your family that are already used to you being a certain way. If you want to change your way of being change to be someone better the who you are now because out dont want to be the person everyone talks about. Just by being yourself you should care about what other people think about you because you are who you are and no one can change that. Secondly; just by changing you can loose your inner self. You had already been trying to be someone that you like or maybe even respect. If you want to change you should do it for yourself don,t do it for your friends because at the end of the day they wont care who you are or what you are. Most of who you are and what you do can reflect you as a person of good. One thing my grandma would say to me is "" sweetie be yourself dont change yourself for anyone because no one will respect you and love you like your family will"". Be you dont push your inner self away because no matter how rude and annoying you are your still one of the best person in your family. No one deserves to be changed just because people think your not a good person already. Show your inner person because you are probably hiding someone you havent brought out yet. Most people can bring you down just by talking about you are even getting other people to hate you maybe because your to quite or your not a good person. Be you unique in your own way and show everyone that you are good with who are already. Thirdly; your personality shows your character as one. No one wants to b friends with someone that he or she is better than everyone else because thats not true. You should always show where you come from even if you are poor and dont live in such a beautiful house. One reason i could say is because most of those things show that you dont care about what people think or say bout you because everyone stands out as who they are. Dont be someone youll eventually regret being because that could reflect on you changing. If one of your friends, cousins, siblings stops talking to you dont bring out a mean person you werent supposed to be because they could pull away from you and not want to be near you again. You also cant be a coward just because someone gives you advice on changing the way you are because maybe they are trying to help you be someone better and of good. Be the person that stands out for being himself or herself and not the one that everyone says oh they copy everything I get or ever wanted to be more popular somewhere be more known as a person. Fourthly; Changing back someone you had already change to can be difficult because you had already pushed away the person you didnt want to be. Trying to go back to that person you used to be can be long ago by the time you try to change back to that person. Most of the people that pushed away from you now may never come back because of you changing who you are and or were at one point. Most of things you did to change yourself can just now affect you and can never be out back together again. Be yourself dont be that person that tries to back to him or herself just because you dont like the now you. You decide to change to be a better person so move on and keeping that person you wanted to be at one point. Youve changed for a reason so now you should em braise it and love your change. Who you chose to be will be that same person youll possibly be one you are more grown into life. Lastly; be yourself and dont try to change yourself to be someone your not. Who you are now could help you throughout the rest of your life. Maybe not always be yourself but dont do it or someone that doesnt deserve to see a change in you do it for yourself. Do everything to try and be your own and unique person all at one because a lot of people would like to around you. Just by being yourself could always reflect on who you want to be once you grown up and leave from your families home.",10,8,9,9,8,8,3603,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 10"
417,276,F9DDE725DB74,"To begin with, it is good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In point of view, it is good idea because when students finish their high school in three years, they also can work, and save money to enter college. So its good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma, and start to apply in some college. Also, students can find better jobs with their diploma. First, it is good idea for students graduate and obtain their diploma because some students need the diploma to enter college. For example, my friend Generic_Name needed her diploma and start to apply in summer to enter at the Hampton University. Furthermore, students whos want to achieve their diploma in three yaers, they have to work hard. But some students wants to achieve their goals without make any kind of effort. Second, students can find better jobs with their diploma because if you dont have any diploma you cannot work in a proffessional job where people pay more. For example, my sister Generic_Name have to work after she graduate from from high school, but she need a good job to save money to enter one year later at college and pay her first semester. Instead, some students have to work because they dont have any type of help from their families. If students have to work is because they want to enter college. Third, some students cannot finish their high becuase they have to work for maintain themself. For example, my cousin Generic_Name cannot finish his studies because he have to work at 3:00 pm to 10:00 pm so he dont have time to his asignments of high school. Some students cant graduate not because they dont want to, cause they have to pay bills from their homes. Also, they dont have a better job to pay their studies from college and its harder to them to obtain the diploma from high school. In conclusion, it is good idea for students finish their high school in three years and enter to college. So its good for students graduate in three years and obtain their diploma. So students can find better jobs with their diploma and pay their studies from college. But, students cant graduate not because they dont want to, cause they have to work and pay bills from their homes. Also, when students have a positive main they can achieve whethever they want, it doesnt matter the situation that you live you can finish your high school and enter college if you work hard.

First of all, you will never know everything but the most important things is trying because if you dont try, you will never learn, but sometime its okay to be failure without a enthusiasm that means that you dont care, you are not interesting in anything or another way to see that dont have a enthusiasm is when you waste time for example if i feel like i am just losing every time and i dont even has a enthusiasm, something to be focus, I will enjoy my time to try to better, to be a winner I always will be try to increase.

419,23,2DAA07621328,"Technology is taking the must attention than the comunicacion with other peolpe. Technology allows to complete many task without having contact with other people. Algouth, people say that technology is the future of our lives. Nevertheless I think people have the reason and this bring negatives effects on peoples lives, the technology is taking our comunication with other person but its true we are going foward so each day the technology its growing in to our daily lives. In this present people can check out any book they want to read, shop, and play video games without speaking with other to another person. In the past the people could come in the librery search for a book that the person wanted to read or ask to one of the employes from the librery for help to find a book and then that person will take a seat and spend the time he want to spend in the librery reading that book, that person comunicated with someone but now in this present people dont talk to any one because of the technology. In this present you dont have to move to anywhere to read a book you can do it from your house seating in your sofa just with one clic with the computer. The technoly helop us im many ways but depends and how you are usining. I used to go to the librery and read many books but like I said before now I just read a book in my room from my tablet and I did not need to speak with any person. Go to the shopping store and buy thing for the bathrooom, livingroom, garden, and the garage was funy in the past because you were talk with people at the store during you were serch for some items. technoly change the way how to shop because you can use your computer to shop in online even if you dont have a computer you can do it from your phone the technology change our live in many ways. Technology is taking our laughs,smile,and the opportunity to met some friend. I used to buy some food at Chipotle restaurant and I laugh when I see my working at Chipotle and that is how should have to be, not how I do now, I just use my phone to order food from the app Uber Eats and they bring my food to my door and that it. Have fun with friends in the school,strets,and the parks it chagend thanks to the technology. This reason why technology it changed our way how to live makes me feel sad, childs in the past used to have fun with anything because technology not was to big. but that changed when parents started to buy a cell phone for thir kid thta was the most error they could do because kids doesnt have the must intelligent brain to reconize how long they spend their time in the cell phones, technology took the childhood of our kid. when I was a kid like 10 year old I used to play with my friends after school in the floor with littler cars and we inmagent that we are like pilot of faters cars it was so funy. I think our kind have to enjoy their live having fun, not spend the time with the cell phones playing games. To conclud I thing it has limitation of human cantact due to the use of technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Those negative effect could destroy our lives for just use the technoly every single minute. the comunication with others its over because the technology is taking the must time of our lives. True technology is the future of the world but keep it in main how you can use the technology and the technology dont use you.

422,2642,DBC8CBF56BB9,"As a child, I always loved to go to the park. It was my favorite thing to do because I loved playing games with my sisters and sometimes wed even make up our own game to play. However, things have changed in the past few years and now I barely ever go to the park. The park isnt the same fun and cool place that it used to be anymore, but why?, Why did it change so quickly?. There are so many reasons to why the park hasnt been visited as much as before, but, yet again only one reason explains why most people barely ever go to the park. The reason for why people never to go the park now is because they dont know what to do at the park anymore. People think that the park is a boring and useless place, but the park have many purposes. People now spend more time on their couch and on their phone and its very unhealthy and concerning especially when it comes to health issues in the future. The park is a fun and entertaining place to be because there are millions of activities that you could do at the park that are very enjoyable. Im going to list a wide variety of fun and entertaining activities. First off, you could always go the park with friends and/or family members. Its always great to be around the people you enjoy the most, especially in a beautiful environment like the park, where everyone could enjoy themselves. Second, you could always head to the park for some quick exercise. You could run, jog, do yoga and much more when youre at the park. Its always a good idea to clear your mind and go for a run at the park when its beautiful outside. Its always important to make sure your health is in good condition and you can make sure that happens by taking a walk at the park. The third activity is, play some fun games at the park!. When your at the park you could always play some fun games that get you pumped up and happy. With the nice, fresh, open space that is available, the possibilities are endless!. You could make up your own fun games with your friends or family members. Now my fourth fun activity is, throwing a fun party!. It could be a birthday, graduation or even a going-away party, The occasion doesnt matter at all!. Having a nice party at the park is one of the funnest things!. You could do a barbecue and play with your friends and/or family members. celebrating outdoors is a great way to have a blast. My fifth activity is, help clean the park. This activity might sound really boring but helping our your community is 100% worth all of your time. When helping out your community youre not only helping those around you but youre helping yourself, the environment and the animals. Many animals live in parks, for example. a squirrel , birds, worms and even small insects. So next time you go to the park, or are planning to go, make sure you at least pick up one piece of trash, because that small piece of trash could save the animals and the environment. Now my last but certainly not least reason is, grab a book and head to the park and read. This might seem like boring stacked on top of boring but doing this helps you clam down and relax a lot. When youre in a beautiful and peaceful environment, how could you be mad?. Why should you try one of these activities?. These activities arent only fun but they do help you in the long run. Hanging out with your friends and family members help you appreciate the people in your lives but also the environment that it giving access to being able to be around people. Taking a nice run at the park helps you by being healthy and improving your well being. Exercising doesnt have to mean running and jogging, it could be yoga too. Making up your own games help you build up your mind especially when you have access to so much space, you can pretty much create a fun and entertaining game. Reading a book is one of the most important things that you have to do in order to build up a stronger brain and doing to it in a peaceful, quite and beautiful environment makes the experience 100x more pleasing. You dont have to choose one of my ideas, you can choose and make up your own activities!. So next time you go to your local park, make sure you contribute and acknowledge the beauty of your community and make sure its being properly taken care of.",7,7,8,8,7,8,3101,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

424,240,A02E1D0BEACF,"Hello, this is Generic_Name and i go to Generic_School. Today ill be taking position on an issue i have been hearing alot about .The issue is should students go to school or study online and take online classes. School provides more social life more teachers, and more classes that you have to go to everyday. When online classes are providing the classes you need to gradute but its online and for free unless you are trying to take extra classes to gradute earlier. It will be all your responsablity. Students that go to school. They will have to wake up early around 6:30 - 7:00 to catch their bus to go to school because the bell will ring at 7:55. School also provides lunch and breakfast which i think are very good for you. they care about how your nutriton is or if the food is fresh or not. They have vegeteran food for those who are vegeteran and they got chicken and rice which i find pretty healthy. There will be social life going on during school because you will be meeting all these people from different places which i find very intresting to meet other people from different countries. You have to be very responsible on how to talk to people and how to act in public because it can get you in a serious trouble if you dont act straight. You will have 5 minutes to get to each class otherwise you are late!! be on time always. You are also getting so much help from the teachers you are not alone. If your teacher isnt there you have your friends in class they can help you figure out what you are stuck on school starts from 7:55 and it ends at 2:55. School will help you find your college there will bea class for you which is called career center that can assist you and help you find whats best for you and contact them if you decide. Online or video conferencing (home school) is what people usually call it. If you are homeschooled you get to wake up whenever you want and you can go to bed whenever you want. You can start working along studying and balance your time and see what benifts you in the future. The choice is yours of what you want to eat. You will have more freedom, there will be noone there to bother you if you get bothered easily or like to work quite. I personally know alot of people that care about what others think of them and if they have friends or not or would people judge them because of what their wearing. If you are homeschooled you dont have to worry about that. The course will take you where you need to be its very straight forward , and they will quiz you very often to make sure your on the right path. You can decide when to study or what days that will depend on your schedual if you are working or not. There will be onone pressuring you to do homework or yelling at you if your late to school or class. Students consider taking online classes people judge alot nowdays and if you arent smart enough you will get your feelings hurt and that might cause depression for some people which can affect the student life. My position on this issue. this issue is very common and i hear alot of students considering taking online classes .I think students should go to school and learn there because their will be all the help they need. They will take care of you not only that you also learn how to deal with people in real life and experience stories that can maybe one day make you laugh or maybe some stories that we all have learned lessons from. for example: lets say you get in a fight with someone and you and the other guy both got in trouble over something silly during your time in high school you will realize that its not worth it fighting people therefore you should take at least 10 seconds to think before you do anything that you might regret in the future. You will have teachers that can tutor you after and before class if you need to they will be on you because that will benift both of you guys. teachers would have very good history of good students and good grades teacher and students will have a good grade that can get them to college. If your taking online school you might fail to organize your time and the year might just go to waste. I say that becasue you will be with your family or working trying to save money for yourself but then you run out of time and your finding it very difficult at this point. i think its a very risky move to do because you will miss out alot of good days and a great atmosipher to be in with all these people around you and the teachers who try to help you success in your life and help you achieve all your goals by going to your dream college. go to school guys and stay in school.",7,6,8,8,6,6,2144,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
425,2699,DDD3771E1DF6,"Many people believe that they do not need advises from others in order to take decisions in their life,and they believe they should take their own decisions. I do not agree with them. It is important to listen what other people think about it. Each person is different in a special own way and someone else might help you to solve your problem. I believe people should seek guidance from experts and authorities because they may have a better idea,or they may have been in the same situation before. One of the main reasons is that other people may have been there before and they may know what to do. For example, You are undecided about taking swimming classes or piano classes,and you know you are a great swimmer,but youve also wanted to play piano since you were 6 years old. Your brother have been in that situation before, and he thinks that you should take piano classes from Monday to Wednesday after school, and swimming classes every Friday after school, but you have to work from Thursday to Sunday;then he says that you should take piano classes every Monday and Wednesday after school ,and Swimming classes every Tuesday after school .You believe that is what best suits for you. Another reason is that other people might have a better or different idea than yours. Another example is that your parents give you two choices: going to Canada for spring break or going to The Bahamas for Christmas break. Generic_Name,your best friend have already visited those places and she tells you to go to Canada because she knows you love extreme low temperatures .You tell your parents that youve decided to go to Canada and once you are there you realize that it was the best decision youve taken. Thanks to your friends advise;you are enjoying your trip,and you are glad that you asked for her opinion. On the other hand,letting others influence on the decisions you take is not always the best thing to do. A simple example can be that you go to the mall and decide to buy a pair of shoes but you do not know what color to choose, so you ask your sister and she thinks that the red pair is the best for you; you buy it and when you get home, you realize that you do not like those shoes. The first thing you would probably do is blame on her because she told you to buy the red pair, but if you take that decision by yourself and you regret for the decision you make; You cannot blame on somebody else except for you. In conclusion, people who seek guidance from their family,experts, or authorities are most likely to take the right decision. All persons sometimes may need an advise from someone on what to do, or if they should follow their own instincts; but the one who will make the decision is you, so do not blame on others for the decisions you make. Humans are not perfect and we do not always take the best decisions in our life; but with help from others , we will be able to make them right and move on.",7,7,8,7,7,6,3148,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
426,3711,A21A69767BEE,"So why do ask other people for their own opinion to help us make the better choice, well by improving your people/talking skills, That most people are usually nervous to talk infrount of others, and how we organize what got from the opinions. Lets to learning these reasons and hopeful teaching you some life skills! What do to improved our talking/people skills, its important to get feedback from others and you dont even know when you need it of not. Like heres an example, Generic_Name problem weather she should join the lacrosse team or not and doesnt know what to do. But she gets nervous, so she gets scared asking anyone to help her. So she goes to ask her friends and family weather or not to join. Questions like that are used in everyday life and its always good to have a second pair of eyes to help you along the way, But its hard when you are nervous. How to not be nervous is hard thing to do, Because thing has the mindset were people are judging them every second. When you talk to people about something like Generic_Name she ask different friends and family on problem and still gets nervous around them. When those moments happened you take a deep breathe. Because this what want to say. The people arent going to bite you, they will answer you just like everyone else. Focus what you want to say, no one wants to be stuck in a cage of guilt, because of one questions they never asked. Now I hear that a lot and why Im telling you this its because I dont want to see the coward out of anything you are going to strong to go through the future, jobs, relationships, and more. Now you to ask your friends about your question you need help decided on. When you go the ask something they feel like their opinion valves you a lot to help you with that decision, and might give you more information form other person also could build a stronger relationship. With a lot opinions weather you should join that team, it does give you different perspectives on how different people react to that problem. Others will say yes or no, and might give into details. Now that Generic_Name understands to strong and not scared, she gets her opinions and now ready to sort them out. She uses the simple pros and cons list, and able to find her answers easier then before. Now she checks the list and more votes for her to join the team, and she happy to use her life skill in the future. Now what did we learn while reading this well, we understood what type of problem Generic_Name had and probloby relate to your problem. we learned that some are scared and nervous to talk to others and that its important to get over with it, to not cause even more problems in the future. Lastly how can we organize the opinions and how simple it is to do. That why I think its better to talk to other to more then one person for their opinion. So I hope next time you can remember to use those skills in the real world.",5,5,6,4,5,6,2171,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Im thinking that the world is trying to make me who I am and make me see. the way I am can make me do whatever I want to do. I could visit wonderful places like seeing great nature, going into a big forest, and go see big hills. this would be amazing to see wonderful things. I can be myself in a world when it is constantly trying to make me something seeing things like a place to see nature. Sometimes in some places to see nature is amazing.

Going into the forest usually it is just trees, but when I see something new in the forest, it would be very interesting. I would see in the forest that the life is changing. Also I would see fresh fruit growing from the trees. And also I would see a beautiful area with flower bushes. Sometimes I think in a world that makes me something else wants me to see everything. This can maybe explain that I am on top of a mountain or a hill. Hills would be better for me because I just only want to see a high view of the land, with the mountains it is too cold and windy. When I see big hills usually it is just grass. Going up to the top of a big hill and When I see that this land is clear, this may explain that theres only a plain grass area with trees, this is similar to the past a long time ago. It is good for me to be who I am, and being myself in a world. This may explain almost everything. Saying that I disagree with this statement thinking that It doesnt seem very interesting, it may feel like Emersons statement doesnt make any scents.

429,3391,71F27422C5FC,"My friend, Generic_Name, is a very good student, he will not go to bed unless he finishes his homework. However, because the school has changed the system from five-day school week to four-day school week, he had to do more works than usual. He cannot sleep for a few days, he did not done all his works, and his grades tend to be bad. His parent decided to move him to another school. Changing from five-day school week to four-day school week has lots of disadvantages, mainly these three reasons: students do not have time to do more works, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises, and students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. To start with, students do not have time to do more works. let say that if we have an extra day to review all works that we done to prepare for the test on the next day, it would done well than when we just have more few minutes. For example: before the school change the schedule, I have a whole day to review my works to do the test, now I have to rush off my feet to review my works and that make me completely exhausted. Whenever the test would start on Monday, the students will have three-day weekend to do so, that is a completely waste of time. To continue, students move to other school due to the pressure of homework at school tend to rises. For example: My friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, they are good students, but because their homework is too much, they could not done all homework, they had to stop all the club activities to catch up their classes, their grades went bad, so their parents decided to move them to other school to help them study easier. Some people believe that the school has four-day school week is better because they can have more time to learn and relax, they are wrong because having four-day school week make their time rush and their have to run to catch up the schedule. And the last, students do not focus on learning because of three-day weekend. For example: Generic_Name, a student from my class, he usually absents from school, since the school change the schedule, he started to go to school more often, but he did not study, he went around and talked what he did in the last three-day weekend, his grade was bad, but he did not care. In conclusion, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week to conserve energy and resources, but the school does not have to because school is where people come and learn new world, to explore more what are we capable and able to do, we are not wasting the resources, so why we have to adopt four-day school week? Please write a letter to the local government of the city to change the schedule of our school. We are not using resources to waste, we are using resources to make a key to open the ""Success Gate"" leads to the bright future for our generation and the next Americas generations.",8,8,8,6,6,7,1474,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
430,3854,38FA6185D43F,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and I agree with what former said because to succeed in something you have to accomplish many steps to get there. Feeling motivated helps you succeed and accomplish your goal. Its better to keep failing at something over and over again because you can see what you need improvements on but eventually youre going to succeed. For an example, my sophomore year I was taking geometry and I didnt do very well during the school year but there was a point where I just didnt even care anymore. I failed all four quarters for that class during the year and I dont blame anyone but myself because I know I was capable of passing and succeeding the class. The reason why I didnt pass the class was because I didnt feel motivated and I just gave up too quickly just by a few fails I made. I kept failing constantly so I didnt even try anymore but If i wouldve followed from what Former said, I know I wouldve succeeded during the year. However, I took the class again that same year during summer school and I knew I had to pass and give it my all. From all the fails and mistakes I made, I learned from them. I kept practicing and I kept motivating myself, there wasnt a moment when I doubted myself. By the end of summer school I passed the class and all I had to pass was my SOL and I know I had to work hard to pass the SOL so I kept studying. The same day I took the test, I was going to receive my score and I took my time on it but eventually, my teacher told me I passed and I ended up getting the highest score from the class. I was proud of myself even though I failed many time I eventually succeeded. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and from my experience thats why I agree with what Former said. The most important thing you cant do it do is give up because If i wouldve gave up I wouldve never succeeded.

431,2723,74FF4379012C,"BEING YOURSELF. Being yourself is by far the most fulfilling accomplishment any individual would have ever made. Not only does it take a lot of confidence, devotion, and self acceptance, but also the ability to learn, understand and love yourself both internally and externally. people tend to have different role models for various reasons, for example my younger sister always wanted to be like the famous singer Beyonce because she had a beautiful voice. They might have some things in common which draws them closer to the idea of being just like them. Little do they know that them turning out exactly just like their role models is almost impossible because they lack their unique personality traits and acquire their own completely different set of traits which makes them who they are. The sooner people realize that each individual is unique in one way or another the better. Being yourself does not mean breaking the rules because you like it but doing the right thing in your own unique way. Not only does that stand out but also makes you feel good about yourself. A perfect example would be comedian Liza Koshy from YouTube who made a whole career out of being unapologetically herself while she did comedy!.Using her as inspiration would be healthier than aspiring to be just like her. With that I conclude that being yourself is not necessarily a walk in the park but putting effort into it would make a bigger difference than following the crowd. Ideas lead to actions and by visualizing yourself doing things correctly but in your own way is killing two birds with one stone! Author Waldo Emerson was right about being yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else being the greatest accomplishment.

I know to much people dependt of other and that`s no good. The history class said too much about that because in the past the people are not indiviuality.

Pero aqui sigo y seguire por que creo en mi y se que cada dia que me propongo algo lo cumplo. No es nada facil cuando llegas y conoces personas de otros lugares algunas muy buenas y otras no tanto. Me agrada demasiado aprender cosas nuevas y nuevos lugares solo hay una cosa que me enoja y es que apesar de no ser una persona indocumentada y pues nosotros los puertorriquenos somo parte de estados unidos y solo por el hecho de que nuestro primer idioma sea en espanol muchas personas nos tratan como indocumentados. llevo 2 anos los cuales no an sido nada facil ya que la escuela a sido uno de mis mayores obstaculos pues es bastante complicado entrar a un salon y sentir que estas completamente solo. pues por el hecho de no poder preguntar o comunicarte con alguien no nada solo te quedas hay viendo como todos pueden y tu no. Unos meses despues de que llegue de Puerto Rico comenze a salirme de la escuela y hacer las cosas mal ya que no tenia apollo de nadie alli ni en mi casa.

433,290,13D960FD28CD,"It better working as a groups because the teacher will think that we will benefit more thing as a project or classwork. And also that we will work together and talk as a groups for the teacher because working alone is hard to think for the one question that you dont know what is about. So many of students think working as a groups is better will help each other However, teacher will thinks many from us that will improve from talking each other and together. Because the student will do more stuff and talk a lot also as a groups and alone because many student will do that to get focus and pay attention the class. This why that people prefer working with a group is better. Because the reason that we want working as a group is that we will work together and help out the question to talk and give a convince from the work. That we will dont know the answer from the question or the problem because for example, well you think that as a sport you need to be in a group that play together, talk together, and work together as a team is the same thing in the school or other place. For the other example, you saw the cartoon of luney toons that bugs bunny and the duck doing the play for the opera that people will laugh this is call working together as a team to do funny thing in the cartoon shows. So many of student think working alone is better. Because you will achieve more thing be yourself and thinks more hard you never think before from the work. A lots of student and teacher think it will go better that working as a group well it going to be hard that whatever, that i need help or my friend need help we can not work together we only going ask the teacher for help for the question. Because many of student will do more better job in the class to do work and think more stuff outside the place. For example, some singer that work alone because the there want to be alone that make a better song and to do something and plan yourself to leave anywhere you want to see a better life alone. In conclusion some people like working with a groups and other half like working alone because the teacher said if you want work with a group go ahead if not you can work alone. So a lot of student show the teacher you can do both as a same time because it doesnt matter if want work as a group or alone because there will give you plenty of time that to do same thing as a group and alone.

Its a good idea to implement this but at the same time it has some disadvantages . One of them can be that the students will be stressful. A lot of hours in just one place can make the students to got bored an tired of it. Its not just that a lot of students have responsibilities as paying rent and bills. They need to work to pay their responsibilities and if they come to school for ten hours they wont have enough time to make more hours in their job.

Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students. To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do. Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So its good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them. Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school. In conclusion, I think its good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program.

436,2630,4F89EB8CB97F,"I think this is a great idea, normally a person graduated in four years, but if we graduate en three years of school it will be the best for our future, because we can take advantage, start college one year early, and finish it one year early, and it will better for any student who wants to take advantage in life. I think it will be better but this is going to be hardest because you have to study more time, and have classes in summer, and evenings but all effort has its rewards. If two girls are in High School one of these (person A) took the programs that allow students to graduate in three years, and the other one (person B) took the traditional four years. The person A graduated from high school in 2015 and the person B in 2016. while the person A was studying her first year in college and working, the person B is in her last year of school, obviously 2019 is the last year for person A in college and graduate from college will help her to work in something about her career. Well what I do is if I graduated in just three years I will take advantage for work hard and take some few classes before go to college all the fourth year, and then the next year I will have a good amount of money for college, and when I going to college I keep working but less hours, I think this of allow high school students to graduated in three years is great idea. Knowing that the students only have three years in high school it will help the students to put effort in high school and to finish early high school and college. If more students are interests in this program it would be better for everyone, because you are going to graduate in three years, you are going to college, and then you are going to be a young professional. I think that if you are young and professional you will have more opportunities to have a job in everywhere. people is going to say that the high school is going to be more difficult because you are going to have many classes in only three years, and that you will not enjoy your vaccation in summer or can not do something that you like in evenings, but how I said before all efforts has its rewards.

Although, online is still a option because you just need a computer or a laptop to take online classes, and not having to worry about missing the class when the teacher took notes that day. All you have to do for online school or video conferencing is get online and do all your classes, and not worry about getting to school. Students need to go to school instead of online or video conferences to learn more and participate in class or school. Going to school than taking online classes or video conference is way better because you go to school and actually pay attention and not get distracted of what is around you in school ,however, taking online classes can get you easily distracted when youre at home or a public place trying to do you work and you hear people talking and having conversations all around you. While youre in school you can peacefully finish all your work in class and ask for a question, or even help from the teacher, but if youre taking online classes your only source is most likely going to be a online source, or the guides they give you online which might not be always correct. The information online could be outdated. while the information at school is planned out and ready to be given out by the teacher or staff at school. Even though, everyone would prefer online classes over actually going to school, people should consider going to school for a backup just in case the people taking online classes dont like how it is done. Going to school and learning just for being in class helps you in a lot of ways such as visually, speaking, and self control, however, if youre at home taking online classes it will only help on your visual learning. Taking online classes can probably be difficult sometimes, because people can forget to take the class the day you need to log in ,however, going to school and knowing which days to go to school is very helpful because you can learn without any problems happening. Although taking classes online and not having to go anywhere and stay where you are is good, youre putting your grades at risk, the computer can malfunction or even be corrupted with a virus on it, and it can slow down your computer or even shut it off every time you need to do your work. This is why going to school is more efficient. The people that go to school have no worries just bring all the materials they need for class and work and pay attention.

Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes. On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities.

A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time. Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom. A good attitude is important because even when people have a difficult time they can face them. ",7,7,8,8,6,7,2621,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
439,2473,6C6B01577E01,"Yes i agree with Churchills statement about the importance role that failure plays in the pursuit of success because we need to learn to not lose hope in what we want for success and our future. Imagine you keep on failing and failing but knowing your going to be successful in life? Imagine not losing fate or enthusiam to pursuit for success? That is what the Former British Prime Minster once said that ""Success consits of going from failure to failure without the loss of enthusiam."" How would you know your going to fail to pursuit for success? What is success? Success is to achieve goals you been wanting to accomplished. Everyone wants to accomplished something or anything. It feels extraordinary to be successful in life but to fail is something that no one likes including to success. Its understandable to make mistakes because you can learn from them and try again until you get it right. No one is perfect,its understanding to make a couple of mistakes here and there knowing you can learn from it. Everyone wants to be successful in life or in anything. For an example when you apply for a job you to apply first, then wait for a response for the interview,After when the interview is done you have to wait a couple days or two until they call you to notify you if you have gotten the position or not. Well thats how we feel when were trying pursuit for success hoping that we can do this and having fate to not give up. When you know your failing to pursuit for success is when you keep making mistakes but you keep going until you get it right. No matter how many times you keep making mistakes it wont stop you from what you are doing or trying to get. You can be still successful no matter how much you fail because it will make you smater for success. Success is something that many have achieved or have not but at the end of the day were resposiable for any mistakes,actions and verbal language that we have used,It could affected anyone or anywhere. As we as people must continue on to be motavated for success if not someone else will speak up and take charge.

440,2872,BA0D3D6A8A94,"I disagree with this plan. I say this because the amount of hours we come to school everyday is enough. If the school board add another hour and a half to the school day all students will be tired, and the students would not be able to learn everything during the day. Being in school for a long period of time and getting homework would put a lot of pressure on the students. For most students the amount of time we come to school at the moment is already putting a lot of pressure. If the school board add another hour and a half most of the students will surely dislike school and maybe even drop out or show no interest in school work or homework. Students would also have a very short amount of time to study for tests or the big projects that they have to finish outside of school at home because some students have a part time job. Students need some free time for their happiness and physical health. As a middle school student I can say that I get to have free time and do my school work just fine at the moment but with getting one hour and a half added to my school schedule I dont know if I would still have the time to have fun and do my school work and still manage time to spend with my family and friends. It would effect my health if I dont get enough free time to play with my friends or do the things I like. For those students who have a part time job wont be able to spend enough time with their family or friends or get some time to rest. It would surely effect their mental health, physical health and happiness because they are not going to get enough time to work out or do something fun to rest their mind. Teachers with part time job would have a difficult time on teaching students their best and having a part time job. Mostly all teachers have a part time job because they have a big family and their income from teaching is not enough or they want to save money. All of them have their personal reasons for it. But teachers can not have a good part time job if the school board add another hour and a half to the school day Because teachers must stay after school at least once or twice a week to help the students that needs help or want to take a retake on a test. Teachers will not have enough time for a good part time job or to really take good care of their kids for the ones that are married. The ones that are not married to just take good care of their mom and dad. So teachers would either have to quit teaching or get their salaries increased. So they wouldnt need a part time job to earn more money and they would have time to take good care of their family. Drivers already are taking a risk for driving in the morning when its dark. Its very difficult for them to drive a school bus thats full of students when they cant really see the road. Adding one hour and a half is the last thing that the bus drivers need on their plate even if the school board adds one hour and a half to school day its okay for the bus drivers. But whats not okay is the after school program. After school program is for two hours and with adding one hour and a half to the school day thats three hours and thirty minutes later than the normal time. It would be really dark. So it would be really hard for bus drivers to drive and it would be too risky. It would be dangerous for the bus drivers and all the students that is going to be in it. After school is a program that helps every student make up missing work, retake a test or redo their homework to bring up your grades. It also help the school finish their work quick when students stay to help for their serves hours. But sadly the schools might have to shut down after school program if they add a hour and a half to school day because it would be hard for teachers, bus drivers and students. Students wouldnt stay after school because by the time the school finishes all the students would be really tired.",8,8,9,8,9,8,2501,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
441,2381,FBE8983EF69C,"Have you ever participated in a extracurricular activity at school, Did you enjoy it? In todays day and age there are tons of extracurricular activities and even maybe some you never heard about. Its always nice to give something a try even if you have never done it before. You could even join something that you have already done before and that your good at. For example, if you are good at basketball you could join the basketball club and have fun doing what you like. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they can gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends. My first reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they gain new experiences. Its always nice to try something that youve never done before. For example, lets say you have no experience in cooking and theres a cooking club you can join. By joining that club you could learn about different foods and how to cook them. Those cooking skills that you learned could take you a long way or help you with something simple like cooking you or somebody else some food at home. Another example could be joining a club that has to do with the wild and things like nature. You could learn about things like how to make a fire or what plants are dangerous and which are not. There could even be some hands on experiences like fields trips to go camping or just explore the wilderness. These could help you if you ever wanted to go camping on your own later on in the future. These are just some of the things you would get to experience joining new clubs,there are so many more. My second reason that students should join extracurricular activities is that it could help with their health. If students join a club they will be surrounded by other students and this will help them stay socially active. Instead of being at home in a dark room playing video game or on their phones, they could be talking other students and enjoying the activities in the club. Its always nice to have people surrounding so that way your not alone. Being alone could lead to things like depression or social anxiety and no student should have to go through any of those things. Another way it could help with their health is by joining a sports club. By joining any sports club students will be getting at least forty minutes to a hour of daily exercise. This exercise that the students are getting could help them with things like weight loss or just trying to stay in shape. Its always good to try and maintain good health and these are some great ways to do it. My third and final reason that students should participate in extracurricular activities is that they can make new friends. By joining these extracurricular activities students may meet other students they have never seen before. This could be a opportunity for them to be able to make new friends. On top of that, they could most likely have the same interests as they chose the same club or activity. For example if they joined soccer they may have a interest in soccer and they could build off of that. Once they become friends they could do things like help each other in school or maybe even hang out. They could even introduce each other to other friends that they have. For example, One student could ask the friend he made in the Art club if he wanted to sit with him during lunch and now that the student has been introduced and they can all be friends now. Making friends is always a good and fun thing to do. Overall, extracurricular activities are a good thing for students. Whether its if your making friends, helping out your health, or even learning new experiences. Extracurricular activites are a big help to students. They should be encouraged to join and try them. I agree that students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity because they gain new experiences, it could help with their health, and they can make new friends.",8,9,9,9,9,8,3814,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

I always try not to take care of what other people say they can talk whatever they want is their problem but when someone comes and they dont like that they can get hurt and there is when they look for you when they are in trouble, when i am angry or sad i just like to play soccer because that helps me to forget the problemsm that i got in my mind, if could it do something. i would it try to make games of soccer so all the people that want to play soccer can get to do it and they can forgot their problems too. thats why sports are made because people can have fun without fight, and one more thing it can be is to go with friends to see movies or to watch soccer games or basket ball games or volleyball i dont know but there are a lot of ways to get to know someone, in my way i think that everything got a solution for the problems the problem is that we dont our respect to other people if we do it everthing it would be really different Everything that we want is to be safe in a place where no gangstars are bbecause they only know how to make peolpe get more poor of what they are we should get involve all the families to try to destroy the people that are hurting others, alot of people try to study their best to be someone in their life they just want to get out their families out of trouble, out of bad ways, they can make alot of money easier when they finished ther school, only with high school finish you can get a nice job not a job that you would like it but you can get at least something. People can be safe having their things like if someone try to take all that you had they just can go the police and tell them what happens and they might help them and they might help to try to recover what they lose people shouldnt be scared because when they show that they are scared other people can be smart and do a lot of things to thm just because they show sacared and all that we are people really smart but we sould be smart in everything because not because we are smart in some things it means that other people can be nice with you if you dont show angrily other people angry can hurt you in one way that its going to hurt you a lot.

In addition,students who practice sports can become better because they can have more resistence and their body is healthy,also they can be hard worker in the future because their body is already made to bear that,practice sports at the schools is good because students recive credits for that and a reward if they win,that can give us new experiences and fun time also makes new friends who like to be active like me and others students around the country and around the world.

And even if we have a Policy against cell phones students would ignore it if is at lunch time because nobody is there to tell them not to use it, and the school already have to much to pay so the school would not pay someone to look at those students who are using cell phones during lunch.

448,2323,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone. To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the stores stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals. Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future. As can be seen, it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine. If the whole world have the willing to keep learning despite they are mastered in something already, they will be more professionals and a wealthier society.",8,8,8,8,8,9,937,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

I try to complete all the work i have but it is hard when all the teachers are saying,my work is more important. We are constantly reviewing, working or studying and sometimes its just too much.

Being outside or in a new location gives students the chance to get to know their surroundings. however, being controlled and forced to stay in one place makes them feel like prisoners.

First,student from high school much of them have a job and they need take class at home just for three hours and then rest to get ready to their job. They also can have time to do homework its how it can be easy for them to study more and have a grade and graduate. Second, if they are almost to finish high school, but they just need a credit and they dont want to be in school just for one class they should take that class online and have more time; it can be for homework or they go to visit another place but they cannot missing that class because they need that credit and grade for graduation. What about they can not stay after school but they need that grade they can take that online while theyre at home. Third, if the person have deformity they could not walk, or just dont want to come to school for different reason most be bullying, they can be benefit with the online class so they can get they class done and fine what they want to be in their future, also can have their graduation. I really think those are the reason why they can be benefit with the online classes they have more time for homework, job, rest, and visit others place, and also they get the grade that they need that is how theyre benefit.",6,5,6,6,4,7,1679,"conventions 7, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
453,2388,898A8417D70E,"Do you know that 80% of students that goes to the after school program and received more extra help succeeded more than the students who didnt go? After school program helps students that needs more help to succeed, pulls up students grades, and they will have extra time to complete missing work and home works. If a student wasnt available in a class and missed the class lesson;They would have the opportunity to stay after school with their teachers and learn what they missed and complete their missing work that they havent done in class. Students stay after to study with their friend and teacher for the test and receive help on difficult lessons by that grades will increase for students that will make them succeed in the future. And its a better way for teachers to explain the lesson without interrupting the class and make other students confused. Having you missing work done at school might be hard to do in classes but by having the after school program you will have the time to complete them with your teacher and your friends and taking more help by asking the teacher about what you dont understand. Sometimes some students needs more time completing the tests or the quizzes so the only way to complete them is staying after so they wont lose points and grades. On the other hand some students think that staying after is a waist of time and you wont receive any benefits, and some dont care if they have missing work or classes they missed ,but its all wrong staying after is a much better way for pulling grades up its a really big opportunity that teachers give their own time to their students by complete missing work, making the teacher explain the lesson again to the students to make them understand the lesson and what its talking about so they wont be confused or fail the class. In retrospect after schools programs is big good opportunity that most schools provide for students to receive that extra help from teachers to complete what their missing to make students succeed in school and pull up their grades thats why we should persuade students to go after school for help, thats why Im base with school programs.",8,6,7,8,7,8,1826,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

If we are always doing, then we can accomplish. We accomplish more by doing something. If we didnt we wouldnt have the things we do now. We can accomplish things as a team or individually. Like sports, in sports people work together to win. A game company, these people work together to make a game, so that people can play it. In a game people play together online to win as a team or individually. Its better if we do our work, homework, or even little things like play outside, hangout. Inactivity in its own way has a purpose resting or sleeping, relaxing. If you do that you let out that steam. We take a break after working hard on something. So we do what we have to do for a couple of hours, we go home, we can take a nap, eat, watch a bit of tv, or sleep. That way the next day you can be motivated to continue doing your job, or go to school. If we do even a little during the day weve accomplished like go out and buy groceries, clean the house, and cook. If you do that then youve accomplished something. you cant really do anything if you sleep all day. Being lazy is not good.

When students have confidence is important because they can turn in their work with out thinking about getting a bad score, Students can put their best effort in their work and they have confidence theyll have a good score. when students have confident they want to participate more in class do class activities, Students having confidence is important because they can have a positive mindset and they have that confidants to teach other. Students having self-respect is important because they learn how to respect them selves and others, when self-respecting they think about what they are going to say before they talk sometimes students didnt mean to say it in a wrong way do they make them selves look bad and others start making fun of them. when we have self-respect we learn how respect our decision how to talk with manners. Setting up goals is important because you build off the skills you already know and getting better. when i was in art class i kept getting bad grades and i never thought that i was going get better at drawing, but I set myself a goal to get better at drawing go i started practicing everyday and started to build off my skills and eventually i get better at it. Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because its showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes.",6,7,6,6,5,7,2301,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we dont try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,well never grow because well never have the enough experience and a better quality of life. First,well never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience well have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesnt matter that we good.

Some people dont like to be always doing something; however, do we accomplish more if we are always doing something. We can accomplish more if we are always doing something because we dont get bored, we can have a good and healthy life and we can achieve what we propose. Firts, we dont get bored. For example, if we are in our home and we are doing something like cleaning the house, or cooking we dont get bored easily because we know how to spend our time. Another example, when we are doing nothing during the day, the day feel so long, but if we are doing something during the day, the day feel faster. Also, when we do something different each day we dont get bored because we dont repeat the same routine each day. In sum, focus on do always something is good to not stay bored. Next, we can have a good and healthy life. I think, if we are feeling sad, or we are having negative thoughts we can start to do always something to distract our minds and feel much better. Addionally, when we are always doing something like activities we can have a healthy life because we can spend our time doing excersises in home or going to they gym. Also, if we dont do any activities and we just spend our time watching movies or staying in bed, we can get sick because our bodys are not in movement, but if we are always doing something we dont get sick because we are having our body in movement and doing good activities. To conclude, It is important to do always something to have a good and healthy life. Finally, we can achieve what we propose. For example, if we are in high shool and we want to graduate, we have to do always something like go to school everyday, do our homeworks and pay attention to have the opportunity to graduate. Also, when we wat to get a job we need to do always something and go to find a new job to have our own money and be responsible. Also, if we are always doing something we are gona fight for what we want and we are gonna be better persons. To summarize, we have to focus and do always something and achieve our goals.

459,2894,4F35BA561593,"Some people ask if it is better to work with a group or alone? Everyone has different opinions about the benefits of working in a group or working alone, some people prefer working alone and others prefer working in groups. I believe that the best way for the people to improve is by working in groups because they learn more and understand better. First, working in groups help the people to improve in school or at work because they learn new things. For example, listening other ideas and points of view from their partners. One day my English teacher make groups of four in class and gave each group a piece of paper, then he put some questions in his board and told us that we need it to answer them as a group, when we finish the teacher told us that we were going to discuss it, then when each group discuss their answers with the class we all realized that each group had different opinions, ideas, and points of view. Each group learn something new from each other. ""Everyday we all learn new things in life"". Second, working in groups help the people improve because they will understand better. For example, asking their partners if they have a question or didnt understand really well. My history teacher gave the class an assignment that we need it to completed by the end of the class, when the teacher gave the instructions i didnt understand her really well, then i ask one of my partners if he could explained to me again in order for me to understand it, be able to give my opinions and help my group. ""We could do more if we all help each others"". Many people believe that is better to work alone because they will concentrate more. For example, they will not get distracted with anyone and will finish the work faster. A friend of mine has always work alone because she said that when the people is working in groups they tend to start talking, distract others, dont do their work and by the end of the hour only got a couple of questions done. However, this argument is meaningless because if they dont understand really well, then they would not have a partner who could explained to them what they are doing. For example, not finish their work because they got stuck in a part. Not having someone to discuss the work with could be hard sometimes. In conclusion, theres a lot of benefits when working with a group. Some of the others benefits that working in groups has are; making new friends, having the opportunity to learn more about your partner, and learn more about yourself. Having to work with someone is a good idea because you dont have a lot of pressure about having to finish the work on time or not having idea what to do. Even though some people say the opposite, i believe that working in groups is better than working alone. ""Sometimes you will need a little help from others in order for you to improve"".

For example, if there is two guys on a job interview and one of them show a positive attitude while are asking him questions but, the other person is answer all the question with a bad attitude, the person with a positive attitude will get the job because, a good attitude show who you really are. Showing a positive attitude can really show where you came from and how your parents educate you. Other wise, if a person show a bad attitude and he is insulting all the people and his way that demonstrate that his parents didnt gave him a nice education. Because, the attitude came from how your family had teach you to respect the people. A nicely attitude can even help in the education. In other way attitude is the most important key in education because, nobody will teach someone with a bad education. It is important to demostrate a positive attitude when a teacher is explaining something because, that way you desmostrete the techer how much effort you are putting in the education and that you really want to success in your life. Other people thing that is not important to have a good attidute to succes in life. Because, sometime you can be in a bad moon and attitude is something that you cant control.

Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow. Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather its good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families. Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. Its another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger. In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it.

For example, you meet a person that has a lot of tattoos and you have a bad impression of them, but then, you interact with that person and you find out that he/she is not what you thought; therefore you cant judge a person based on their appearance. I think that how a person dresses doesnt determine the type of person someone is, but if you let someone to express their feelings your opinion on them will completely change.

467,2080,A643E3470F54,"No,I dont think the school board should add a extra hour to school each day. My reasoning is because If you put this in a students perspective,they have to wake up 5 or 6 am in the morning to get ready for school,stay there for 9 hours and come home to do homework. You cant even imagine coming home a hour and a half later trying to get homework done. If the less time students are home,the less time they have to complete homework or assignments. I also want to point out If students are trying to get more homework done,the less sleep theyre getting and If kids come to school the next day,they wont get the information they need for their classes because theyre tired. Students will start to fail in school because of no sleep and this time in wont be there fault for their sleep management. This time it will be the school boards fault for adding stress to these children and why theyre not getting enough sleep. Im not saying its impossible for student to come home an hour and a half late and still get their sleep,but If they have homework and they spend there day focused on it its likely students wont get good sleep. Reasons like these are why some students cant graduate from high school. To rap this up I say that the main reason why I dont think it a smart idea for the school board to ad a extra hour and a half to school because, more students time management of doing homework and getting sleep would likely fail in succeeding in school for present and future.

Here in the United States they have the option for students to attend classes from home by online or video conferencing. They have that option specially on universities because some universities are out of the city and a percentage of students with a bad economy may not be viable to get transportation everyday. So In my opinion that is a great idea to have that option on universities. They should have the same option in high school but not to all the students because that may cause students to fail the classes. High school s should give that option to students with excellent notes and for students who live out of town. Attend classes from home by online or videos has benefits, oneis you become more responsible, second it helps you to earned money, and gives you more opportunities to success. In one hand,Attend classes from home it may be a big responsibility because you are doing it by your own no one is going to help you or push you to learn. For example when you attend to class in a school or colleague there is always a teacher ,who is there to help you,supports you ,and make sure you dont fail your semester, they also make sure that you are learning and getting better everyday. Instead when you have to attend classes by yourself you must be confident and responsible to make sure that you are going to take classes everyday and dont waste the opportunity,because no one is going to be telling you more than 3threet times to do you work .There are some students that dont know what be a responsible person means, does students may not be viable to get good greats by taking classes from home. This kind of students need help from someone to push them and teach them to be a responsible person. Be a responsible person is important because it helps you to success in life gives more opportunities and you dont depend from nobody you learn how to do things by your own. In the other hand one more benefit to attend classes by home in online it helps you to earn money specially if you live in large distance from school. A few houses are located miles away from the city that means schools are located miles a way from home. In that case attend classes from school it would be very helpful and a big opportunity. Because take transportation everyday Monday to Friday it may be expense because you may pay at mornings to get to school and pay back in the afternoon to go back home. One more benefit is that it help you to success,you may be a viable to find a job. For example you can do your online classes in the mornings and find a part-time in the afternoon. Many students do this they go to school on mornings and work for a couples of hours at night. But if you could attend classes from home it would be so much easier to work and study at the same time you would made your own schedule withou a problem. Also make sure to give enough of time to do your online classes and get good greats. In conclusion I do believe this potion to attend classes from home in online or videos is a great opportunity. Specially for students who live out of the city and for everyone who was to success in life no matter what. School and universities should let students know about this option. I am agree and I believe that I may not be the only one who support this idea. Therefore this opportunity should give to students who really needs it and no to those who would waste it .This kind of option should be in all over the world to help people with bad economy and help those who want to success and have a passion to learn. Students who have the opportunity to attend school everyday without a problem should know that there is people that live far from the city that they would love to be seated in a classroom and attend school everyday.

469,3238,0D9288F0A6C9,"Generic_Name 10/23/2018 Schools should extend time by two hours because students will have more time to do there class work. If a students have more time to do there class work then they will not have there class work as homework. Having more time in school means that you can get your work done and have extra time to do othere class work. In my old school we only had seven hours of school and we have eight classes in a day. most of the time we barley had time to finish ower class work so we had to finish it as homework. We also did not have time to do labs, expirement, and project. Thats why having more time can help us do all of those things. Another reason would be is that teachers will have time to explane to students things that they do not get. Teachers have time to explane things to a students and help them under stand more about what they are learning. In the movie Matilda students there only had six hours of school and teacheres did not have time to explane things to students. Students only went to school, tooke notes, and went back home. Sense they had no time at school to do class work they had a lot of homework. Most of them did not even finish there home work becauses it was to much. At the end of the movei students had took an exam and they had the whole six hours to finish it. When the time was up ninde persont of the students did not finished so they automaticly failed. if only they just had more time, more students would have passed the exam. Another reason would be that having more time can help students is that scientists prove that having more time added in a school schedual will help students incress there acidemic by ten persont. That means if i spend more time in school learning i will be come smarter then students with a regular schedual. Having more can help students finish work they would not normaly finish when they have a regular schedual.",7,6,7,7,7,6,180,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
470,2332,A0D47C0DD67F,"Individuality is the idea of freedom of thoughs, but why we are concerned what other people think? Lets be honest everybody had copied at least one time in a test or quiz just because it was more eassy to coppy than being trying to remember the anwer that obviously you did not know. We own our thoughs, thus, we should do ours ideas not somebody elses ideas In the book called ""Maria Magdalena"" based in the movie ""The Davinci code"" states the ideas of one individual who thalk about the true behind the story about Maria Magdalena ( Jesus mother). To catholic people Jesuss mother is saintly. Their sanctuary, the church. To the author of the book ""Maria Magdalena"" she is just a lies layer. On those old times there were many poor people who were opressing by the church, they sufer in the churchs hands. The church killed to protect the true behind Maria Magdalena. On those times existed the crusades in spanish the ""cruzadas"" in which the church fought the protestants to convert them in their cristianity if they negated to accept it they killed them. The victims decide to follow their own beliefs and the consequence was the death. This is a good example of individuality similar to our way to live in the present. The politics want us to do what they want to their advantages opressing our rights just like the church did with the protestants during the crusades. The author of ""Maria Magdalena was very brave to wrote about those things. He was very successful because nobody used to talk about this, now they do. In this book he shared us a little part of what was to be different from the others and take their own decitions. Based on this I state that we can share our ideas of individuality and do not let our corrups politics to opress peoples rights. In the present we have a huge amount of successful guys because of individuality. The influential ideas of the past are not in our day to day anymore. Parents now teach their offspring to take their own decitions knowing the consequences of this. Now we, the tenageers, are more prepared to develop our ideas and beliefs. Constantly, my mom develop the ideas of individuality in our family. One year ago I decided to start to work, and I am very proud of my decittion. I remember my first day of kinder garden, All the kids playing and runnig around the field. To be honest, I prefer being painting rather than be runnig for no reason. My arts teacher gave us draws made by her.""Ready to paint"" she used to say, but I was so rebel that I made my own draws just because I though her draws were so bored. I was a little girl taking individuality decitions and I did not know it In my conclusion I am agree with individuality, If we want to spread the individuality, then we should start saying what we think, because the bravery of the unexpected ones, will persuade the shyness ones. Individuality can be hard but not impossible. We live in a world with influencers that try to persuade us to be like them. Do not choose the easy way. I prefer the hard way, so then I would be proud of my achievement just like Ralph waldo Emerson said: ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplisment""",6,6,6,4,4,4,2155,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Other students that gets in trouble all the time are just better off learning from home. There, at home, there is no one to to fit with.

472,52,56053054CB1F,"I believe that your character will be what you yourself choose to make it, The disicions you make can play a big role in how you turn out to be. For example the people you hang with, How you grew up and the type of household you were in, And my last example is is your motivation because being motivated can help you build good character traits for the future. The type of people you hang with play a big role in your character because you can pick up a lot of good and bad things from different people. They can influence you to do a lot and you know what they say ""you are who you hang with"" for example if you hang with people who do nothing but good you are going to want to do nothing but good but if you hang around people who are lazy and sit at home doing nothing with there day you are also going to become lazy and not motivated to do anything. The way you grew up and the type of household you were in also plays a big factor in your character because thats what you are around, Thats the energy with you all the time for example if your paerents are having problems at home all the time and you can become depressed and feel down all the time, Since thats the energy thats in the house, Which can make you start struggling in school since you would be down all the time. But on the other side if your household is very good, everyones happy and the vibe is good it can make you a very happy and positive person since thats all the energy youre getting, nothing but positive vibes and it can help you with school. Your motivation in my opinion is the most important part of building good character traits because its so good to be motivated and having a something to work for, If you have that the past does not matter and you can be the most awsome person that you can possibly be for example if you are really motivated you can become anything you want. Your past and all the things you overcame can motivate you another example is if you and your family is really struggling that is going to want you to push harder, And in that procces it would build a lot of good character traits that will be with you forever. In conclusion you make your character and choose the people you hang out with, The type of hpuse you are living in and the things that lead up to you being motivated and i dont think you can get influenced beyond your control because you can control everything you do for example if you dont like your friends switch things up, If you dont like how things are going at home go live with someone else. Everyone should always know that nobody can or should control you, Everyone makes choices bad or good you are the one who made that choice.

First of all, you can get addicted to basketball because its so enjoyable that once you play it, you dont want to quit.

This addiction can make you enjoy basketball way more than you used to. Next, some people enjoy basketball because if how fit you can become just from playing basketball. People find that so enjoyable becasue you can get fit and have fun from playing basketball. People even play basketball just to exercise and stretch. This leads you to working out while you run across the basketball court and shoot the ball into the hoop. Finally, it can make you mentally fit because of how focused you are on basketball.

483,604,C465964DA6D5,"Do you think that you need to fail over and over to become success. In this essay, I will argue about the important role failure plays in people success. people that become success is because they have failure a lot of time during the process, and they work harder each time to do it better. When someone success in something, they had failure in something one time in their career. Maybe the fail they took in their career is what make them successful. They knew, if they dont work harder they wouldnt do any better. A failure can teach you lessons to do better that last time. That why a lot of people said that never gave up just for a fail that you can have. Thats what make a person successful. Failure is something that all of us do. Thats what make us do better in life. If we all ignore are failure, we would keep failing over and over. That why we have become successful in something in are life. For example, when I was 10 years old, i couldnt ride a bike. I away fail trying to ride it, but i never stop trying. I try doing different way to learn. My success of riding a bike was based on failure that teach me different way to learn something and better. My dad have a company that he have work hard and a lot to archive what he have now. He never loss his enthusiasm to make his company better, years over years. All the knowledge that my dad have now is by the failure. Sometimes he have lost a lot of money, or work for free, because he dint do what the customer said. Some times was because the customer dint like the work. Now he know that he should do the work as the customer said and do the work better. He have learn that he should do what his job more better and do what the customer said. Some people said that you dont need a failure to become successful, but they are wrong. Success comes from failure that make you have knowledge. All the failued that you took make you work harder and do way better.

Their life is so important to them that they could make own decisions without people tell what to do or ruin their life. People should be wrong about their life not other people life.

485,549,F3E0762BFA43,Some people say working alone is more benifical. Well I think working in a group is more benifical. My first reason is it keeps you away from boredom. It keeps you away from starring at a wall for hours. And it keeps you away from sleeping in a class room. Its more helpful having someone to raise and boost your energy and being the confident person you are. Now days in a classroom were haveing 60 percentr on students being unsure about there answers and being unsure if they should even speak up. Being in a group helps you raise your voice. Manny Adult and students are suffering boredom and thats not healthy. Talking to your peers and being around people more keeps you away from depression. Making your self feel more confident about yourself shows who you really are its like the next step to being a risk taker. My second reason is you can talk and discuss with your group about your project or work together. Its more faster being in a group where you can actually discuss about your thoughts and idea and feeling more confident than ever. Having a partner check it look togerther for any mistake or errors. My final reason is you save lots of time for yourself. And not everyone is right. But creating these ideas from yourself and your group could make something turn out to be unthinkable. Being in a group makes your mind grow and learn new things and ideas from other people. Your having a good time with your friends and if not you meet new people that may become friends with you. You want to talk and move around and meet new people getting out. Not being shy or denying yourself wrong. Being in a group is like your bring peace in a table. I belive that everyone should try new things being in a groups and its okay if your wrong because there is no right answer. Being in a group helps you become bigger and bold about yourself your trusting you self and your classmate. I believe working in a group is more benificaial rather than working along cecking your self and thinking if your rong and feeling unpositive about yourself.,6,6,6,5,6,5,3615,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
486,2827,5AC16E188F1B,"Today technology is arriving into the schools. Some schools offer distance leraning as an option for the students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Do you think that this would benefit students? I believe that it would not benefit students because of technology distraction, student behavior, and the different in capacity and ability for a student to understand things. First reason, technology is an useful tool that people can use to learn or discover things, but it can be a huge distraction on young people. Today the technology is everywhere and it has everything which make it a powerful distraction for students. Also, the students can copy any work from the internet while they are taking their online classes. The students will not learn anything if they copy every single work from the internet. Most students on school classes get distracted really easy by something around him, and also get bored when the teacher explain a new theme. I believe that is going to be more bored and distracted being at home alone doing conference and watching videos about the class. My home can distracted me more than my phone or computer, most kids have a video game, TV, family, and so others things that can catch their attention. Second reason, student behavior can be a problem with online classes. A lot of students do not respect or listen to their teacher at school, and I am not wrong thinking that it would be the same at home with online classes. Most of this students do not listen to their teacher because they do not understand the way that the teacher explain or they do not like the teacher. So you can have an idea of how worst it can be i will give you an example, if a student do not like the subject of the day he can easily end the video conference with his teacher or he can just not listen to what he is explaining. The student can also not enter in to the class at the right time. I believe the there should be someone near the student to tell them what to do and how to do it. Last reason, not all students have the same capacity to understand things. Not all the students have the same capacity to learn or understand by just watching videos or looking at pictures. I am a person who need someone to be physically near by so he or she can tell me how to do things. All the students that have this disability would be affected by this type of classes and this would make them to loose their credit on the class. At the same time this new type of classes is creating a barrier between students, teachers, and school. Conclusion, the online classes do not benefit students because it can create a barrier between students, teachers, and school. The technology used for this programs can generate a distraction, and that can be a huge problem on future, the environment and behavior of the student can be a barrier too, and the different in capacity or ability to understand things can also represent an huge problem. At the end non one benefit from this online courses. ",7,7,7,7,7,7,1173,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
487,590,915D8BF74963,"Is it good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? For example, I got a academics scholarship into George Mason. With that scholarship I earned and worked so hard I could have a high chance of becoming a banker or someone who runs money and I been committing to this career from 8th grade. Knowing and committing to a career puts you on a very a head spot in life and also on what you want to become. First off, having a head start of knowing what career you want in High School puts you on a spot that youre a head. People who dont know what careers they want, gives them a struggle because when you get to College or finish High School they would be in a position of not knowing what to do after. The stress will build up, over thinking, anxiety, give up, depression, and lastly the most important going to the wrong path. But people who know what career they want in High School will be ready for what college they should go to, what classes to take, after college theyll be applying to jobs, and lastly, doing something they always wanted to become or do since High School. For example, I have a friend who just turned 20, He always told me about what career he wanted to do and his plan after High School. A year ago, I asked him about his career and plan. He already has a job of what he wanted since High School but at the age of 19 and also told me he was thankful for staying with the career he always wanted and never gave up. He also told me, It wasnt easy to become what he wanted and no matter what if you want something, keep pushing and never give up because soon youll be proud or yourself. Secondly, The stress of committing a career from High School is less than not having one. People who already know what they want to become or do will have their challenges because it wont be easy to getting up there. For example, people who already know what they want will face tests, projects, public projects, quizzes, finals, and etc. But thats only what they have to face. For the people who dont know what they want to do, will start worrying about what they want to do, stressing over why they didnt think of a career in High School, over thinking, and etc. Its better if know what you want to become early than late because it could waste your time if you start late instead of starting early or on time. Lastly, having to learn different careers is good, but itll some times be confusing, over whelming, stress, anxiety, and etc. But just knowing one career youll be able to focus on that specific career. Trying to push yourself passing those limits, making yourself you can do it, never giving up, and reaching your goal. Having to learn many careers is very good, because you know a lot and a high chance of getting many jobs. But learning and staying one career is better because you will know what to do in a mil of a second. People would want to hire you because how fast and hard worker you are. Its better to have a head start from everyone than being last. Therefore, knowing and commting to one career puts you on a very good spot. For example having a head start, less stress involved, and lastly choosing you love since High School. Finally, these are the reasons why it is a good idea for students in High School to commit to a career at a young age. So what, are you going to commit to a career at a young age because time is clicking and soon itll be too late.

Some example could be emotions, not giving up, and a quote ""Third time is the charm."" These are some of the things that people do in order to succeed though failure. First, when people can not got something right the first time they can get emotional such as upset, mad, and frustrated and many more. An example of this could be when you are working on a math problem and you did not get the right answer the first time people can get upset. That is why emotions can be a part of failing to get successful. Moreover, when people can not get something done they tend to just give up and do nothing. People should never give up because not everyone gets it the fist time. One example can be when you are trying to find information about an animal and you can not find anything on it so you just give up and not do the research information and now you are going to get a zero for it which is not good. This is why you should never give up even if it is hard for you Although, most people have heard this saying ""third times the charm."" This saying has a meaning to it because it is telling you that you have to keep on trying in order to get it right. Sometimes when you keep on trying it can turn out better then the other times that you tried. One example can be when are drawing something and you do not like it you can try again and do it better then the first time. Keep on trying in till you like it or in till you get it right.

In my opinion I believe that the limitation of human contact due to the use of Technology had positive effects on peoples lives. People use Technology to complete many tasks through out their lives. If their was no Technology their would not be any improvement in our lives neither country. people can contact their family with video calls to see their families that they havent seen each other for years. It has been 7 years that I am living in United States of America and I cant go back to my country for various reasons, but I have been in contact with my family everyday, which makes me really happy, and feel good about it. Nowadays everyone need Technology for everything. My friend father is an engineer, and all his work is with computer, and Technology. If their was no Technology he wouldnt be able to complete his task or learn new things neither earn money. Technology saves Millions of people lives in many ways. Many people do not have money to take tutorials for their kids, but they can use YouTube and Google which let them learn in a better way, and without paying any money. In fact even though if you had money you could save your money and use Technology/ Internet for learning. My parents never took me to any tutorials not because they didnt have money but because they wanted me to be independent and use Internet to learn more. Technology had helped me a lot, and will be helping me and millions of people in this world. I think in this Generation If their was no Technology people would not improve or even learn anything. I have learned from Internet that you can read books online instead of going and buying. Technology has let people gain education and experiences through our lives. Their are thousands of disabilities in this world which they cant go and work, but they use Internet to sale some stuff so they can earn money. My cousin is a specialist and he was born with not having one of his leg. He was so depressed and didnt have any confident that one day he could work and earn money, but with the help of Internet I have thought him to buy some clothes and other stuff and put it online so people can see and buy it. Technology has lots of benefits that we humans are so lucky of being able of using it which some people cant, because of various reasons. It has been 3 years that we have opened our own clothing business in Unites States of America, and as we all know its really hard competing with clothing stores here in USA, but from the time we started putting our clothes in websites and becoming popular day by day we are making lots of profits which makes us really happy. Technology has a positive effects in our lives which a lot of people agree with my opinion. I agree with that, that Technology also had a negative effects in our lives , but also that depends on the person itself which decides how to use Technology. Most of my friends make fake accounts on Instagram and Facebook to bully people which a lot of people die from being bullied. Technology has a lot of advantages and disadvantages that we can use form it. Some peoples use Internet for watching bad videos, making fake accounts and put putting fake news on websites and hacking people through social media which are really bad, but their are only 5% that they do those things, and not everyone which we should think of the other 95% of using Technology for their needs, and the benefits of gaining lots of education. In my perspective I believe that the use of Technology has positive effects on people lives, because we human are earning money out of Technology, learning new things, and gaining experiences in our lives with the help of of Technology. I think their should be a way of blocking the bad websites and making securities for people making fake accounts and for people that bully others to stop it. In my opinion we should think about the benefits of Technology than the negatives because. If their was no Technology our lives would never improve and we would not be able to learn new things. Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contacts with each other. My dad has been in Generic_City for 30 years and his job is sailing Fabrics and all his customers are from Generic_City, Generic_City ,and Generic_City which they have never been in Generic_City.

495,334,A72FE8731B45,"Ever since i started school i never liked the school lunch, i would always go the whole day without eating and I wouldnt take a snack or anything so it could sustain in my stomach. Most kids at my school dont like the school lunch either, because they either think it tast wierd or just they are just picky about what they eat. Normally, when I would go almost a whole day with out eating my head would hurt or stomach and i know most teenagers in my school can relate also because they prefer to starve and not eat the food that the school serves. In my opinion. I believe that changing the schools lunch menu and making it healthier is a good idea because kids would enjoy the food, parents would not conplain about their kids not eating in schhol, and it would be a great advantage to improve the school lunch. Most kids think that the school lunch is not very appetizing, but if the school cafeteria decides to change the school menu it would make a huge difference beacuse I know that most kids especially teenagers are very picky about their food or that its disgusting. When I was younger I wouldnt eat at school and until this day I dont because i didnt like and i would always have somach aches, and my head would hurt a lot, and i wasent able to concentrate in class. Most kids think that its not neccesary for the school cafeteria to change the menu but in reality most kids dont eat at school due the type of food they serve. Sometimes even the parents say something to their kids because they dont eat in school. When i would go to middle school and the beginning of high school my parents would always wonder why I woudnt eat at school, they got to a point where they thought i was depressed and i would always get yelled at because they thought something was wrong with me when in reality i just didnt like the school lunch. I understand why most kids dont like the school food because either it doesnt have flavor or it just doesnt taste the same as before, and also sometimes the food would make me feel sick from the stomach afterwards. Parents main concern is if their kids eat or not. I believe that by changing the menu it would would much better for parents to stop worrying about why their kids about why they dont like to eat at school. My parents especially my mom would barely have time to make me something, for example, she didnt have time to make me a snack or something real quick so I could have taken it to school when I was in elementary school, she would always tell me that she didnt have time that she was always in a rush and thats why sometimes I wouldnt eat. My mom almost went to put complain about the school food and that she wondered if I was the only one that wouldnt eat in school. I believe that if the school cafeteria has a advantage to change the school cafeteria food because they should think about why parents worry about their kids not eating and also parents putting complaint of why their chidfren dont eat at school. In my honest opinion i think that they should shange the menu because when I dont well or i dont eat at all it is hard for me to concentrate in class and that is a huge priority to pay attention in class and try to get good grades. If the school cafeteria plans to change the cafeteria food it would be really great because more kids will be able to concentrate. When i was in freshman an sophmore year I would always skip to go eat because I coudnt eat the school food, i think that kids nowadays do the same thing just so they wont starve. In my honest opinion i belive that changing the school food would be a great idea because most kids dont concentrate in class, parents worry about their kids, and also they it would make a great impact on the schhol.

I agree with Thomas Jefferson that, we have to accomplish in our life because when we will accomplish in our life we will get our goal, however, people might disagree with me, and they think that inactivity serve a purpose and thats not true. Its a great thing to be successful in your live. "" Dont work hard but work smart"". In another words, you have to keep yourself working all the time. When you success in anything you feel comfortable. For example, In our school you have to do your work so you can success. when you let yourself finish the work you will be successful. Let yourself to be accomplishment in anything and you will be successful for ever. When you keep yourself busy, you will never get board in your life. Being active all the time is healthy. Keep yourself working out, study, driving, eating, so you dont get board of your life. Always do anything to until you accomplished and do not leave it until you finished. For example, I go play soccer so I wouldnt get board in my life. If you dont want to get board, make your self create anything, keep your brain thinking in everything, play sports, believe in your self that you can accomplish anything in the world. Do not get lazy anytime because if you got idle you will not be an accomplish person in live. Everyone will be proud of you when you accomplish something. You will be proud of yourself too that you accomplished something in your life. Always work hard so you can get a good grade and you will be proud of yourself. For example, I worked hard last year in World history and Geography and I passed the SOL, my dad and my mom both of them were proud of me and the whole family were proud of me, so you have to being working all the time. In my opinion people accomplish when they always doing something . Always do your work and finished so you can success. Always work hard and keep yourself busy so you couldnt get boring. I know that some people will degree with me, but thats okay because everyone have different opinions, and my opinion was if you didnt work hard you will not get what you want. Let yourself work hard, so you can accomplish you work and success in your life. The best thing in life that you done work and proud of your work.

498,3680,6F9741277AB3,"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life. One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better. Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistakes helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistakes will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful. Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life. These are the reasons why making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts.",6,6,6,6,6,6,1452,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
499,2467,97C6E22BA8EE,"Working alone will always be a better progress to your knowledge. Some people think that is better to work in group than by yourself. But many famous people has shared their own stories of life and it show how working alone can open your brain to another level and acomplish more of what others think that just can be done in group. I read an old story of my favorite wrestler , and he explained how he worked really hard at the gym to become one of the best wrestler man in the whole story;thats why I think is better to work alone because working alone help to increase your understanding , it show that you are willing to grow on your own, and it will be one more step forward of your knowledgy. Consider,for a moment, working alone will help to increase your understanding and if working alone have so many people on the top of hall of fame why we should not try to be one of those people , but to be one of those people we need to work harder than ever. However, people must work alone and they must feel the pain of the hard work that they need to get done. Furthermore,to increase your understanding you must try to learn or do something new every single day of your life, In order to see the result of the hard work that you are doing , does not matter if that is a meantal or physical work as long as you are doing a safe work to succed in those goals. Besides, working by yourself is safer than working in group and when people work alone it show the desires to grow by their own experiences because a lot of times we trust people that we should not trust for many reason as envious of what you are cusseding at, pervert people in your group doing the wrong work that they should not do,and many times they do the wrong work just to see you down or because they are not interesting on the topic or kind of work than the group supposed to be doing. According with paragraph one ,working alone will definitely take you to succed in your goals and you will get each of your goals done. However, you must be focus and give all the motivation to those dreams that you have in life. There is a lot of people that think is better to be working in group than by ourselves because five heads think better than a single one. True , I agrees that five heads think better than one , but how about not every menber in the group is agree with the topic or the material that they are working on; what could happen there is problems between themselves because none of them have the same goals or thoughts. Moreover, it could even cause discussiones with teachers, and it will be worse for the group, so which means working alone would be the best option for everyone to take. That way every person can work on their goals and express their diffrent thoughts without getting into discussions. Concluding with paragraph one,two and three, working alone would be the best fit to you to acomplish everything you want as long as you work for it,. That is why I always try to work alone in all ways because it help to discover new things , a new person inside of you, but also it help to push yoursel forward and always do your best in every single thing that you do on your own because at the end of the way whatever you acomplish,that is gonna be your legacy,. If it were up to me , working alone would definitelly be the first option to people to take in a classroom or any place that you are working on.

Some kids say that science is the worst subject in school and it is boring. In my opinion scinece has a lot of cool stuff that you cant do in any other fun activity in school. my most favorite experiment is when we are mixing chemicals because you dont have a major clue of what is going to happen when you mix them up, and that is what makes it interesting and fun at the sma time.

Considering year-road schools they are good for students to attend too because they retain more information,students stay in school,and become more responsible students. In my point of view, I think they are too expensive,students do not spent time with family or friends,and dont have the opportunity to have new experiences in life; for example having a summer job. For example the experience I had in life with year-round schools was in Generic_City, when I lived their with my family for over ten years after living in the United States for nine years for my life; and for my parents for over twenty year of living in the United States; moving to Generic_City was a big change of life to my family. My parents wonted the best for me and my brothers, so we attended to a year -round school. It was not easy being their because me and my brothers did not know much Spanish but know is are first language. Also it was too expensive,and students did not spend time with family, all kids do is attend to school all year. After me and my brothers finish up are year in that school, my parents decided to move us to a normal school to spend more time in home, and have more life experience. It was so much better being in a normal school because I had more time in school vacation as a student, also had a summer job, and more time for me and family. Also I experence more new thing in my normal school like being part of a band, playing for the school soccer team,being part of the drill team enjoying school like kids shoud do. In my point of view student should not attend to year-round school because some students have part time job,it too expensive attend at year-round schools , and some students plan family vacation out of the country to spend time together. But having this year-round school some students retain more information and stay focus to learn more information. Also by not attending to year-round schools some students have more life experience and become responsible in life. In conclusion i consider students should attend to normal schools because they are less expensive,students can have a part time job, and also have some more life experience to help them become more responsible persons.

First of all, most people respect and value their parents. For example, when I consider getting another job,I like to discuss my options with my parents.

Secondly, I would ask not only my family, not also my teachers when I make decisions about my education.

When teenagers stay out more it because they want hang more with their friends. My friends and i hang out and we smoke. My curfew was 11pm and i didnt check the time then i know that it was past my curfew i ask my one of my friend if he can give me a ride home i got my house keys.

One night around four in the morning i was sleep and then i heard lot of noise. I got up from my bed and i saw my sister sink in from my bed room window and so help her to get in my room but around that time we are sharing my room because we had a room met. We both went back to bed and i told we will talk about this in the morning. In the morning i ask her why she sink out the room and she said that she need to think things over, she couldt sleep, and she want go outside. I told her what happened if someone just take you and then what happened. She said well no one did and i told yeah thank god. We didnt our parents. Most teenagers can get in trouble with their parents. When teenagers get in trouble it mostly with their parents because most parents are strict. When parents are strict it that they want what best for their children than they had.

Humans now at days think that life is all about planing the future, and they all just trying to avoid problems, trying to live only winning but to reach success there must be a long journey of lost battles, of big problems but you must stay put because it does not matter how many times you fall you most get up again, and again.

Back in 2014 it was my first day on the soccer academy I been playing soccer as a defender all my life but this time it was my first time training in such a good team I started training every day make some friends too. A few days later the first game came I was not on starting line up or on the bench I wasnt even call for the game I was upset but I though that it was because I was new in the team, or the coach didnt know me well. The next day during practice my coach call me out and told me if you wanted a spot on the team you need to work harder after that day I knew I needed to start training more, going to the gym more often, and I start eating more healthy a few days later during practice I started seeing results I was getting stronger, faster, and skillful a few weeks later I got called for the teams fourth game but I was not in starting eleven I was sitting on the bench the all game I was upset I though I was failure once more but I never gave up and the next day I was back practice, eating more healthy, going to they gym more often. Halfway during the season one of the the starting defenders left the team and I knew it was my chance I started and I play all the game and I didnt just prove my coach that capable more importantly I prove my self. Later during the season in one of the last games in one play I dislocated my arm and that meant that I was out for the rest of the season. After three long months of recovery after was heal I started once again training harder, eating healthy, going to the gym more often getting ready for the next season. beginning of 2015 that season I was chosen as team captain and I played all the games all that hard work was worthy at the end. It dosent matter how many times I failed I never lose my enthusiasm because in life we are going to have many failures and we will feel life given up but we most get up and keep going it doesnt matter how many times we lose a battle our main goal must be win the war because just like Churchill failed again, and again but at the end he won the war with his people I also failed in my team again, and again but I won my own war at the end.

Matter of fact he was cute, but he wanted just play with the girls. My best friend change with me a lot, she did not want to talk to me no more. About the things that I told her. Lately I realized that he had a twin brother I made a mistake, that my first impressions to him was a fatal mistake. After all, I wanted to apologize with my best friend, but she was mad with me. It was impossible to talk with her. I realize that my first impressions about the idea of his boyfriend had change my friendship with her. Today I just talk rarely with her, it was almost impossible to change my idea, but I did, but my friendship is changed. First impressions cause people change. Some people may say, the first impressions is possible to change immediately, because is not a big deal. They may say that the other people, does not care about their first impressions from them. But this is not case, people always get hurt when they receive a bad impressions to them, they make them to change even with themselves. First impressions are almost impossible to change, even if the problem is big. Thus, the first impressions is almost impossible to change, because what people say is not easy to retract. Is not easy to correct the mistakes, is not easy to correct the words that people do not meant say them. If people say their impressions without thinking them, and then apologized that is fine, but sometime is almost impossible to correct the first impressions, because people hurt someone else feeling. Also, there are sensitive people and they may not forgive people. People may change based on someone else idea, feeling, and opinion. The impressions are almost impossible to change.

513,472,3AFA78FFFC15,So I would be talking about how people should sign up for something at there own school because people should do something they love thats my first reason. Everyone should be doing something its not like your doing it serious but sports is hard in my opinion because you have to be really good at that sport thats my second reason. Not to be on the electronics all day that wouldnt be good at all compare that doing something all the time. But people should do something in there lives because you only live once so do something. Thats why agree to this so people wouldnt all that because if you really love something or sport then you should make dreams come true so your good at it that is all I have to say about people should do something activity at school or sport. Reason number one love something then do it because people should believe what they do also some people dont believe in there self they just knock there self down like believe that your good at it. What if there really good at what they do like people should follow there dreams by being good in that one activity or sport they love. We need really great people to do something dont be doing stuff you really dont like because u dont need to do something it dont make sense. This paragraph was about how to do something you actually wanna do and believe what you really love about your school like dont just sit down and relax like do something in your life its apart of life too. Reason number two everyone should do something in there lives shouldnt be lazy because that wouldnt take you no where when your all lazy and stuff dont do work or anything. Do sports and activity so your body could be healthy because a lot of sports will take you some where. Probably professional sports that would be really great for you like big time. Be active al the time so your could help your own body it could probably grow like that and thats all I have to say about my second reason. Reason number three is not to be in electronics all day long because its a distractions to others you need to practice what your doing in a activity. Be home all day you should really play outside with friends or make plans during the weekend because it would be fun for you and your friends. wont have much sleep at night because if your just distracted about being on your phone all the time youll probably be tired in school or even at practice or after school. So you shouldnt be on the phone all day your play outside go to the movies or chores doing something doesnt get you bored all the time. So this paragraph was about you should stay off your electronics all the time not all but sometimes just go outside and play. Thats all my reason I hope that a lot of people try something that there good at. People try something new in life because life isnt easy at all but you just got to fight for it and be at anything. We all should try something new it would be amazing for other some people got people to look up. To so look up to someone its good because there probably a great person with a great heart. You should look up to others because other people made a big accomplishment. So thats all I have to say about being a leader not a follower like do something once again u only live once make ur life go big. ,5,4,6,4,5,6,764,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
514,166,35D50C79C5CB,"Studies have shown that one way to improve student achivement is to start an afterschool homework club. Teachers and Students volunteer to meet those who either have difficulty in certain subjects or who want to finish their homework early. My opinion is that I find it a good idea to have a homework club, because when I was in 4th grade I went to a homework club and what I did there was of course work on homework but if you finished early you could finish work from later on that day or on things that you could do on the next day and I would always rremember I would be ahead on every paper she assigned to the class because I already completed it! When I didnt do homework club I would sometimes miss fun friday because during fun friday in order to play you must have all your work done and be caught up. But when I joined homework club I havent missed one fun friday game! In conclusion I suggestion having a homework club, it help with grades and getting ahead in class!

518,2152,58A9AE90D009,"What I think about extending two more hours in school would be a bad idea because school can be very stressful and give you so much work that can cause people headaches and wont even have time to do their homework at home and they would get really tired and sleepy that looks like their brain will explode with so much work they do and they would have health problems too a person would not resist too much of their body either. My opinion about it is that they should keep the five-day school week instead of four because I think its really unnecessary to add more hours to school and take one more day of off. I think if that happens they will take the time from other students time with what they are doing outside of school and activities. The idea would be very pointless and useless. I think five days of school is better than four because five days they have seven hours of school and its shorter. For me I would get really stressed with more hours of school be more hours means more work to do and I would get really tired of doing so much work and I would get really exhausted. People would have many things in their head and worry too much about it that would cause so many stress and a headache and it would not be good for them. I think there is some other way to conserve energy and resources than adding hours to school and work. For example they should take care of the earth by recycling and cleaning the water and save up energy. I think it is the best idea to conserve energy and resources because it really important to take care of the earth and learn how to take care of the earth. Many people these days are careless and would prefer to do it in another way like adding more hours to school which is not helpful and that wont do nothing of helping energy and resources, so we have to do another way to conserve it. What I think people should use their brains and do whats best for the whole world and every around us and be helpful. Like for example restore energy would be a good idea or volunteer would be another thing to help the planet, there are so many ways you can do it and how you can do it so it would be really helpful if Everyone would join doing it. Many people would be disappointed for adding hours because they are subtracting their time and very important things they have to do. A lot of people that over work themselves means their they would get really tired and lazy and the community would be very disappointing and out of control. Another problem would be that if they overwork and get tired and them while driving and could get into to a car accident and thats another why their are so many accidents happening lately and that is really bad so it is a bad idea. Know one would agree to work more hours and that would cause them to have health problems and their body does not take to much exhaustion in them and that is really dangerous and would risk their lifes for it, i would not over work myself if I were them that is too much to Handel and would get me sick too that my body would not take it either so no it would be a really bad idea.",7,7,7,8,8,7,1144,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Since technology appear in the world, the life of millions of people got a easier way to live, because it brought most of the things and supplies that we need to make our life better and easier. In my opinion i think technology has positive effect in peoples live specially in young people, because teens who are in school have more opportunities to learn a get the skills that they need for their future, they have access to computers at their school to get more information about their classwork and the benefit to take classes or tests online without even attending to school. Technology allows you to communicate with others without having contact, you dont need to be face to face to communicate with others, it brings people the facilities for those who dont have time to go out to buy the things that they need online like clothes or grocery without going to the store, and the capability to invent things that humans cant do. However technology has negatives effects too, have you ever seen a little kid playing with toys like before technology was invented, you can see kids of 5-10 years old that already have a phone or video game console , they are addicted to it but not only kids young people too, therefore people can lose their vision by using it to much but its not the fault of technology its our own responsibility to take care of our health.

Tutoring and and night classes and can help with everything you need in college. Students that graduate early helps you to get ready for college. This helps all the opportunity for them to understand the learning. The classes you do to understand all the things that happen in each course to help out all.

524,2159,A53DEC5A2DE8,"Think about the benefits of working with group or alone. Well for me working with group is better. The other day i was working with a group on some geometry work in my math class. It was actually very helpful and successful. Everyone in the group was able to understand the new topic. We started talking about it and help each other understanding it. Group working is so much better than working alone. Working in a group is great because they can help you out. And you can help them out. It is way better than working alone. They can help you understand and explain it to you more how they understand it. You can work on class assignment with your group. You can ask them to help you if you are struggling. They will try to make you understand if they can. They can tell you the wrong and help you correct it. The second, reason why working in group is better. You are doing an class activity its more fun if you work with a group. You can work faster and better with a group on an activity. If you are working alone on an activity and you feel it is boring. You might take a lot of time to finish because it is boring. And if you dont know what to do because you were not paying attention you group should know and tell you what you need to do. Another reason, why working with someones else its better. Sometimes student dont like the teacher for some reasons and they will prefer to not ask the teacher for help. Some students rather ask their friends for help. Students may feel more comfortable asking their class mates and not the teacher. Sometimes students dont really understand the teacher very well. Just because of the way she or he teaches. Most student find that is okay and dont let the teacher know that. Because they are not very comfortable with the teacher. Final, that was my opinion on the benefits of working with a group or working alone. For me i can work with the any group and without distracting the other people in the class. And i actually like working in group because its fun. Working in a group its more easy to do the class assignment and take less time. I enjoy working with friends because we can talk about other things to and get to know more people. Its always nice meeting new people and getting to know them.

525,1807,35C5C7E2BB5E,"Working with a group or working alone which one is more beneficial? Well to me working with a group is more beneficial for many reasons. First off you can get help from other members of your group, you dont have to do everything alone you can give each person one thing to do, and you can learn more about the topic. Now that you know my reasons of why i think being in a group is much better and more beneficial then working alone let me go more in depth about it. Working in a group is great because they can help you with the assignment. If you are struggling and one of your group members sees that you need help then they will help you. They will try and make you understand the problem so you know how to do it. They will give you different strategies and other ways to figure out the answer. For example my math teacher put me and one of my friend in a group for a assignment we were doing and i did not understand the concept. I asked my friend to help me and she sat down with me and showed me how to do it. She gave me multiple ways on how to do it and if it wasnt for her help i would still be lost and not know what to do. Another reason why working in a group is better then working alone is that each person in your group gets a specific thing to do. If each person gets a specific thing to do in the group then everything will go by much faster. You would not have to worry about doing everything by your self and putting that stress on your body you will have other members in your group that will do their part of the assignment. Last week in history class my teacher put me in a group with 3 other members. We all had a specific thing to do i had to find the citation for the information we got,Chloe found all the information on the topic, Marcus found pictures of the information, and Sean found videos to support the information that we had. We finished the project at then end of class and we also got a A as our grade. Finally you can learn more about the topic with your other group members. They could find information on your topic that you once did not know before. It can give each student new ideas and information to make the topic more clear for them and also find new discoveries. It will also help them for test and even a quiz because they just did group work and also answered questions and learned new things as well. This is my final reason on why working in a group is much better then working alone. You can learn more about the topic, you dont have to do all the work by your self, and also your other group members will be helping you if you do not understand the topic and need a little more help. These are my reasons of why i think this is much better then working alone all the time. Having a group will give you more advantages then just being by your self trying to do all the work. It is much more beneficial and i also gave valid reason of why i think being in a group is much better then working alone.

526,3874,2B69ADAD868C,"""some people may say that growth does not depend on doing something beyond what they have, for it is not unnecessary. However, that is a fallacy idea because we all know that is not true. Wise people believe that doing something beyond what they have will make them grow as a person, both physical and mentally. Unless people try to do something beyond what they have already mastered, they will never grow, because growth comes from doing something that someone has never done before, it comes from trying out new things, boost up our confidence and makes us progress. Doing something beyond what we have already mastered, will make us try out new things that will help us move on further. trying new things is the only way we can know what we are capable of. for example, i remember trying out something new which was beyond the things i knew, i felt different and new. the feeling that i felt was growth. Trying is what makes us know who we are and what we are capable of. If people do not do something beyond, how do you expect them to grow, when growth is defined as making progress in what someone does in his life time. growth is producing new things that has never been done before making someone realize how good it is to do some that is convince and improve in our skills. Not doing something beyond is as good as not growing. doing something beyond will boost up someones confidence in doing things. the ability to try new things beyond what we have already mastered is what we call self-esteem that alluded from confidence. How would someone have confidence when they do not try new things. Thinking beyond the box , makes some people become dogmatic with affirmative thoughts, because they would always want to do something with diligent. how do can someone expect a person with fallacy ideas become dogmatic? For example, how can someone define a person who does the same thing over and over without changing? It becomes irritating and unpleasant. growth comes from the things that we do beyond what we have already mastered. Some people might say, "" it is not necessary to do somethings beyond what you already have because, having excess of something is not good.""however, that is not right, we all know that having something in excess will always push us to doing more things. for example, Trevor Noah once said, nothing is enough not until you die from it,"" meaning nothing will never be too much. The more we try doing something beyond the more we intend to learn. we all learn from doing something that is beyond our imagination. Unless we try to do something beyond what we have, we will never grow, because growth comes from doing something someone has never done, it boost our confidence, and makes us become dogmatic with positive thoughts. doing things beyond, will always produce good results at the end, such as, advancement, making progression in our daily life. I firmly believe that doing something beyond what you have, will boost someones confidence because each day i try out new things and all i get i enthusiasm of doing more.",5,6,8,6,5,5,570,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
527,1905,C3668997E921,"If I were to be asked to share a lesson with elementary school students it would be how to be respectful, to always learn and, be good communicators. One of the first lessons Ill share with a student would be, being respectful. Being respectful is important to you and the people that surround you. For an example, you cant just go up to your teacher and tell them ""give me a pencil"" you should tell them ""may I please have a pencil"". Also if you dont be respectful to other people, people will not be respectful to you. The word ""respectful"" is not the only word you can use theres other words like nice, polite, and many other words, these ""other words"" are like branches of a tree that goes up to the main stem which is ""respect"". Another lesson I would share would be to always learn, because in life its always important to learn. To learn can be very hard or easy because how you learn is how you move along in life. For an example, when you first stared to walk how did you do it, by learning. Another example is, when your in school your always learning new things like math, history and, writing. Learning can be fun or boring, but in life you always need to learn for opportunities for jobs. The more you learn the better opportunities youll get. Lastly, being good communicators. In life youll always have to communicate if its your friends, teachers or your family, youll always be communicating. For an example, I cant communicate with people, for me its very hard and every year goes by and it makes it more difficult to learn. When I came to my new school it was so hard to meet new people and I dont want anyone to suffer how I did but I learned and now I feel better I have new friends and if I never communicated then I would of just stay quite. A way for you to be a better communicator is to talk more and talk to new people, its an other great way to make new friends. And those would be the things I would share to elementary school students to always learn, to be respectful and, be good communicators ",7,7,6,7,8,6,2638,"conventions 6, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
528,2455,82BA3E4396CC,"Imagine you are going to a diffferent country, and you do not know anything about that country or how it works and you have only heard people talk about it or may have seen it in movies. But you know you have to go there because the education is not well supported by the government, and the president is corrupt and does not care about its people in your country so that is your option to be something in life. It is good to hear what other people have to say even their personal opinions because you may never realize that you may be in their position in the future struggling. Knowing as a kid that you have to listen to adults, but you may think it is not neccessary, I have thought the same thing before I was a teenager and before coming to the USA from Generic_City only knowing 1 word in the new language that you are going to be using the rest of your life everyday. I was born in Generic_City 2006 and moved to Generic_City I grew in a town where snitching and getting into peoples life is a daily routine because people dont finish school bacause they are lazy and others who work to feed their family and never get an education and if you get to finish everything there arent many job options to enforce your career or to make money for yourself so you have to travel to the larger cities for work and you only get paid for day not by hours unlike the US.Everybody tells you to go to the US but everyone gives up because getting paper is super hard and stressful, the chance for you to get accepted are low so people just stay and get a job at a small store until they die and it is sad because they cant reach all the goals they wish they could achieve in such a developing country. Since I was 4 years old I wished to always go to the US because at that age I already knew I had no future back there and I used to watch tv a lot and the US looked like a promising place to live at and there were more job opportunities and I could be what I wanted thats what everybody told you back in Generic_City, and some of it was true you get more chances to be what you want and not end up as a ""vago"" and not be a blockhead. People used to say the language was their biggest obstacle even my mom said the same thing well I never thought I would come to the US of A I guess until my mom met my stepdad who brang us here but before comeing we spent a whole month and more on papers before coming to the US.It took a lot of money, work, and time which was the reason I did not want to come to the US because it frustrated me seeing my mom stressed out about some papers that we needed to come here where I now stand. Once I came to Virginia my mom, and stepdad told me to work hard because the language would be my struggle as well as his when he came to the US around 20 years ago. My first day of school I got in trouble in less that 1 hour and 27 minutes into the day, because some kids decided to bully me and thought I wouldnt say a word because I didnt know how to even say good morning in english well this all happened inside the hallway bathroom I beat them up because I totally forgot fighting was not allowed in the schools and they said ""He started it he was trying to hurt us we were just trying to use the bathroom and he came out of nowhere"" and I got in trouble I wanted to say something but I only knew one word in english which was ""hi"". My school was Generic_School which I used to get taken out of my class for a teacher to teach me english she told me I was the fastest english learning student she had in her entire career as a teacher which I was already starting to speak the language 6 months into the year with no background of me speaking the language in Generic_City. I was in fourth grade by the time I could comprehend almost what everyone was telling me and all the kids became my friends even the ones who had bullied me a year ago. I had struggles with my homework a big struggle my stepdad would come from work late and stressed out and he would not have much patience while helping me with my work and I would say I learned the language because I needed to become independent as soon as possible because it was too much stress on my back not being able to do anything on my own. I came to a whole different world where the school system was different even a math problem was different than what I used to learn back there I was 8 when I came. Something I really like i the fact that there is snow here in the US because there was no snow where I used to live, as well as water I noticed that there was water everyday and all night here in the United States. Water is something that lots of developing countries may not have while others have it for their wet weather and jungle like land where it always rains. In the town I lived you only used to get water for 2 hours of the day and not every day. ",6,7,8,7,7,7,1725,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Dont act like someone else but yourself because you will get caught for trying to be someone that youre not and get made fun of for being something that youre not.

Ralph Waldo Emerson was a Author who believe to be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I agree with that statement but not so many could say the same. There is many human on this planet who cant accomplishment being their self than being someone else than their self . Many people struggle to be their self because of society. Society brain washes people to be someone else than being their self. Nowadays being yourself is lame and being someone else is Amazing to some people. Their is con on being someone else like lying to people until they fine out who you really are.

It will bring problems to the relationships .However its always a good idea to talk it out and come clean. Being yourself make a huge impacts in people daily life.

530,2623,746A0BFABA84,"It has been said that first impressions are almost impossible to change. Why should first impressions defined who you are? Why are they so ""impossible"" to change? are first impressions really that important, why should something so small change the way you think about someone. First, no one is perfect. Everyone has very different personalities or ways of being. Second, it shouldt defined who we are. First impressions dont always go well, you should be able to change that. Finally, It could ruin your reputation. A lot of people care about their reputation a lot. To the point that it could be emotionally wrecking First, no one is perfect. We arent perfect beings, we all have different personalities. Different things we do that others dont and some people may think its weird or we are weird to do that. Thats when first impressions come to play. Meeting someone for the first time can often be hard to manage since is the first time you are meeting this person. Truly anything could go very wrong. They could think they way you talk, eat, and act is weird because you are trying way to hard for it to not go bad and sometimes that comes out as bad. Life sometimes will go wrong and we cant change that or let it get the best of us because we arent perfect and its okay if sometimes things dont go our way of liking. if it goes bad we should be able to change it or try again. Second, it shouldt defined who you are. Every human is not alike in any way possible, all of us are unique in our own way. Sometimes we make mistakes and theres cases where people dont like that. When you are on a stated of mind of anger, you could do something drastic but that doesnt defined who you are on your heart and mind. You have your own mistakes and flaws but that isnt you is just a part of you that doesnt think and does thing on impulse. When you are trying to make everything perfect that person it could stress you out really bad and anything could make you go off. when its the first time meeting that person it can really tress you out bad but thats okay. First impressions should be able to be change because if that were to happen it could really damage a person if that certain person was important to them. You should be able to reschedule the date when everything is better and you can be normal. If they are truly your friend they will allow to you to that. Finally, it could ruin your reputation. Lets say you are the most friendly person in your school and everyone likes you because of how fun or nice you are. you would love to keep that way. But one day a new student comes to your school and you introduce yourself but right out of the bat they dont like you without knowing anything about you. That thought could eat you up for the rest of the time, and you try and try to get that person to like you but they dont. Being able to change that first impression is all that you would like to do but it feels impossible. But it isnt impossible if that person wanted to get to know you they could but they dont want to and yes theres people like that all over the world. Having a second chance could change everything for you but we shouldt let it get the best of us that person will come around at their own time. We cant make people be our friend if they dont want to. If they want to get to know you they will. Conclusion, First impressions are not important things will go wrong sometimes and thats okay. We can always try again another day, it shouldt get the best of us or makes us feel some type of way if that person truly wants to be your friend they will not care about the mistakes you make or anything around that. You are human and you make mistakes sometimes. And thats okay, it doesnt defined who you are;only you know who you are on the inside. First impressions shouldt even be a thing they stress you out and makes you over think. Being able to change the impossible is something we should be able to do always.

533,1699,38203808F81B,"Should students be expected to commit to a career at a young age? Some societies say yes, by the time they get to high school they will be given courses to guide them toward the career they have chosen. With the students given the classes needed by the guidance teacher, It will get them a well paying job right after graduating because they will already have the classes needed for that job. If they plan on going to collage to become a scientist they will offer you classes for free and you wont have to pay for those classes in collage. By having students identify a career by the time they enter high school seems to me like a great idea. once they know what there career is going to be they can take the classes required for that job. Once the student has identified the career that he or she desires, the guidance teacher will step in and set up the classes that youll need to take for the career that youve chosen. when I first entered high school the guidance teacher pulled everyone out of class to ask us what our career was going to be. I remember telling her that I wanted to become a carpenter, she said""great choice we actually have another school that you can go for the second half of school"". I told her that seems great, she also put me some math classes because in carpentry you use math to measure. That was how the guidance teacher helped me achieve the career that I wanted by helping me get the classes that I needed to become a carpenter. By committing to a career at a young age actually helps the students succeed in life. How does it help the student succeed? It helps the students get a good job by the time they are out of high school, by giving him the classes required for the career he wants. For example some of the students that didnt commit to a career when they where in high school are now working in a low paying job. Some are even in a lot of debt paying for the classes needed for the career they want while they could of got some classes for free in high school. One of my cousins went to high school and every year the guidance teacher would ask him what he wanted his career to be. He would always say I dont know yet, time went by and when he finally found what he wanted his career to be it was to late. My cousin is now in big debt with the bank trying to pay for his classes that he needs for his engineering job. If one of the students decides he wants to become a scientist when he grows up. The guidance teacher will give him the classes needed like Biology and science classes. Once he gets into collage he will already have some of the classes required to become a scientist. He will only have to pay for the classes that are not provided in school. My uncles daughter is studying to become a teacher, when my cousin was in ninth grade she told the guidance teacher that she wanted to become a teacher. She was given some of the classes that are required to become a teacher but they told her that she would have to go to collage but they would give her all the classes that they could offer so she wouldnt have to pay as much when she went to collage to become a teacher. Other people argue that a students should not commit to a career at a young age because they dont know about all the careers that are out in the world. They could chose one and latter change there minds into anther career. The is a good chance that all the students who chose the career they wanted ends up being the job that they have in the future. With having the students to commit to a career at a young age is good because they will be given the classes they need in order to be successful in the career that theyve chosen.

These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside. Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday. One popular game from the 1800s is hopscotch, which is surprisingly still played today. Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isnt a really competitive game and can be played alone, its better when its played with other people. Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isnt usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game. This game is one of the most competitive outdoor games played my modern day kids. Comparing these two games, there is a high chance that people who enjoy running would go for tag, and serene people would go on tho playing hopscotch.

Second, the students that take class at home just can be absent, if they need to stay in home and dont take some class, they have the opportunity to explain to the teacher by text or just a call, then the teachers need to ask to your parents if is necessary dont take classes because you dont feels good. The students that take a regular classes in the schools cant do this because they need to be in the school everyday , if not in this case the correspondent sub school has the obligation to put absent in the class day. Finally, the students that take class at home cant missing a class, they dont have the possibility to missing the bus or miss some useful for the school.

538,1950,8F78E9AF1D0E,"Do you challenge yourself often? In this society today do you think we challenge ourselves by making harder goals or easier goals? Michelangelo had stated a quote that proves how society is today and how we set goals we know we can achieve rather than set harder ones and give up when its not accomplished as quickly as you thought it would be. For instance, it can be the littlest things that you wouldnt realize such as, doing your bed in the morning is challenging but you know you can do it so you make your bed every morning. Furthermore, Setting easier goals that you know you are capable of achieving gives you an opportunity to continue to create more and more goals as time goes by. When you accomplish something it makes you feel like you can do many more things leading to something bigger. For example, when you study for a test and you take the test the next day then later received an amazing score you challenge yourself to study every night before a test rather than take a risk and challenge yourself to study the same day as the test because you think you would remember it better. We give ourselves goals we know we can achieve and play it safe rather than challenges because its easier. Such as, knowing your limits and knowing what youre capable of accomplishing. For example, you would rather do something you already know instead of doing something you have no idea what to do in and no longer enjoy it therefore, you stick to what you know you would enjoy by knowing your limits. Finally, Giving yourself a harder goal and not achieving it frustrates you and can cause you to give up on your goal. When you dont know how to do something its frustrating and you just give up for example, In the movie frozen Elsa was forced to keep her powers a secret and to no longer use them but she tried using them and froze Anas heart because she was frustrated. Elsa tried to challenge her self and try to use her powers but since it was so difficult she got overwhelmed and started hurting people In conclusion, People prefer to set easy goals that they are able to achieve because it inspires you to continue to do multiple goals instead of one challenging one that you know is to hard. People need to realize that its okay to have many goals instead of one big challenge goal that can make you lose interest in things ",6,7,7,8,7,7,1907,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

So that means that they cant go out for sports or other activities they want to do bad. Thats like taking everything they have. What if kids want to become good at something, but now they cant because of that school policy. If they have a C average they should still be able to go out for sports or activities. A C average isnt that bad, its higher then a D average. If the school police was if you have a D average of lower they shouldnt do sports or activities. If they have a D average in school for not working hard, thats means that they in aint going to try hard. If they have a C average and there trying hard they should be able to out for sports or activities. What if all the good people in sports have a C average in school, that means that they cant play and were going to lose every game we have. Thats a good policy to get grades up but dont take away something they care about. Everyone should be able to go out for sports if they want to. If the school policy happens, schools going to be boarding now, because now students cant go out for sports or other activities. The students that are doing good in school should feel good about themselves but we shouldnt take the other students away from the others ones.

After that, they are done with the school early, so they have one year to chill or may be have a part time job, except that their parents make them join to college early. They keep studing, and then sometimes people have to move from house, because the college is at another state or city, so they have to rent a room close to the college. In conclussion, graduate in less time is better and worst at the same time, but people know what they do with their lifes, in my opinion I prefer to graduate like a normal student, in four years.

Imagination can make yourself happier, can help people, it also can find a nice job that you want. What are these things mean? Let me tell you in this essay. First, imagination can make yourself happier. Why? It is because you can imagine something that you like. For example, you want to fly like a bird but you cant do that. You can imagine how that feel. It feels free? Comfortable? Or tired? You can also imagine how you look like when you were 100 years old. Imagination make yourself happy. Second, how can imagination help people? Lets think about if there is a child crying in the mall and everyone look at her because she dress so weird. You can use your imagination at this moment. You may told her to imagine with you. For example,""Dont crying sweetie, think about everyone look at you is because you dress like a princess. Now you are visiting them. You have to be nice and elegant. "" Maybe she will stop crying. Lastly,parents always said "" You cant find a nice job that you want by having your imagination."" I think you can find a job with your imagination. For example, if you want to be a home designer but you dont have imagination. You make the house so horrible. You will got fired and you cant earn money. On the other hand, if you want to be writer and you can imagine lots of things and create 30 or more excellent books. You can earn lot of money even earn more that a doctor. So, I think Imagination can find a really nice job that you want. To sum up, I totally agree with Scientist Albert Einstein. "" Imagination is more important than knowledge.

I think that be yourself is an accomplishment. In the world is a lot of people that you can talk quite freely, but those people sometimes are hypocrite because they are acting like they are people that you can trust.

550,2068,24C508ED6FE2,"It is true that there are many ways to influence others. Its not your behavior that defines your actions. Its how you show people by your actions, having goals and to have motivation to be able to influence others. Sometimes you dont even have to be positive to be able to influence others. For example, in the movie ""The Princess and The Frog"" , she wanted to open a restaurant because it was her dads dream. So she kept working to get enough money to pay for a building she wanted. She didnt get it in the beginning, but at the end of the movie she did. What im trying to say is that she had one goal and it was to open a restaurant. she also had motivation to keep working to earn enough money to do so. For my first reason why you can influence others in different ways is by your actions. The best way someone can influence others is by your actions. For example lets say you help out by donating food to your local food bank. That wont make much difference but if you do it daily, word will eventually get out on how you kept donating food for people in need. Especially if it gets on the news about the good deed you did, then more people would donate more to help out their community. For my second reason why you can influence people in different ways is by having goals. Many people whit goals accomplish more that people without one. For example lets say that your trying to save money to buy a new game that coast eighty dollars. But you dont have any money left. So you do chores like cleaning, washing your parents car, or cutting the grass. You still dont have enough. So you start going to your neighbors house and asking if they need anything done. Eventually you earn just the right amount to buy the new game. Basically, if you want something set goals and accomplish them to earn what you want. For my last reason why you can influence people in different ways is by being motivated. You cant influence others if your down. You have to try being inspiring and energetic. Because if others see you being motivated they would most likely do the same. Being motivated is important because it shows purpose of completing a goal. It also shows how hard you are willing to work to accomplish something. some people may say that,a persons behavior is the best way to influence others because it sets the right mood on someone to be motivated. But on the other hand behavior doesnt show how a person can be influence to do something. Therefor the best way to influence people is by showing them your actions, goals, and being motivated.

Its a little creepy in all honesty but its the world we live in where people just wanna fit in and act normal to seek comfort and approval from someone else even when they dont need. another reason i do not agree is cause this generation prefers technology over human contact so its easy to see why they dont go their own path but instead they prefer to just follow the crowd and not follow what they want its mind blowing how we gotta take an sol too just to see if you smart when all you can do is just sit in a class and listen to a student and see how smart they are without a dummy boy test but im just a young student whos following the crowd just to get a diploma even tho at this point a diploma will barley take you far but it looks good on resume so thats why i am doing this exact test to follow the crowd of dead students just trying to graduate for a family that dont even care if im dead or alive as long as i got a diploma ",7,6,6,8,6,6,2064,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Even tho I had some classes with him I would not talk or be around him, because my impression was that he does not shows respect not only to other students but teachers too , therefor I wont talk to him so he would never know me and wont be mean to me.

Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, actually it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something can lead to successful. Thomas Jefferson say it is always good do something. For example,My uncle when my came to united States he always do somethings with his hand such as construction and fix people car my uncle always doing somethings new if thous wasnt good them but tried able to accomplish them as such files tax for people he was able accomplish them. My uncle now files tax people get pay a lots; when people do not know how files tax they came to him files for them by that he was successful because he accomplish more if always doing somethings now he has own company where people work for him. He always advisory worker in order for you to successful always do somethings new. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something. Another example, it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing lead successful for example,Bill Gate who always doing somethings he was the first person to create Microsoft. Bill Gate like always like do somethings with computer. He was successful because he always like to do somethings Bill Gate was rich man on the whole world today because he always do somethings build computer. This show that it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. for example, my brother who was doing somethings he able to accomplish more things. The first my brother do his internship how to construction wasnt good at all but he was also keep doing it instill he was able accomplish it now he know to how to fix roof and many more things he is expert construction build. This that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. Another example I wasnt good at Algebra at all I was fail the class also Got F on classwork and test to I decide to stay after with teacher start practical math question I understand little by little but the first take my math test able pass test got B on the test my first every to got B on math. I use thought that wasnt at my math class but always do somethings in my class able to gain experience in class. This show that It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you gain experience. The other side claim that it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose, because you can be more wise about around you however it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned for example, when my mom came to American she did not know how to speak English. She always practical how to read in English and write English. She was able to accomplish that because she always somethings with English leaned how speak English. This show that is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned. Another example It is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something you can learned . Always doing something you can learned from it for example I did not know how to cook anythings any time put dish on fire never come out good but when always keep cook it start to turnout good I was able accomplish always something new with my dish. Finally it is better to accomplish more if we are always doing something because can lead successful and you gain experience. Although some might argue that, it is better to does inactivity also serve a purpose they are wrongs.

560,1848,5ADD410B9783,"A student does not need to be success to be praised, an achievement doesnt always necessary to have a self-esteeming come from effort failure and motivation, First, success is not the only thing that can make a student be praise. It is their effort whats matters even though a student did not do well on hes work, but a least he tried to do it, may be he is good at it, but he is have been a hard time on his life at that time, if a teacher or someone said good job you did it well i am proud of you. He is gonna be happy of that someone understand him at his bad time, and support him. Second, failure is where a student achieve, learn, and gained experience, e never going to achieve at something without fail. Example, my on experience i have been seem achieve, and things that i did not succeed on it, in my life i had failed many school test or not get the score what i want to me it a fail, but to others it not, i always get mad at myself if i do not succeed at any tiny gold. When my teachers or someone tells me something nice, Good or they are proud at my work i felt so my proud of myself i am so proud that i have peoples who can understand me and support me. One day a teacher said "" im proud to have as my student and to be your teacher you had showed me that no matter what where you came from you can achieve anything you want, also in how hard you have worked maybe your work is no that good, but i had seeing you work harder keep being like this do not gave up on your dream or what you are doing "" she praised me with all her words made me cried , and to keep going believe in myself that i can do everything. Third motivation and self- confident, is what makes the difference, and changes a student life. being confident on what we are doing on our life or working on something even if we dont give our best at least we tried it, sometimes we achieve in something and we dont learned any new thing because we already know hoe it is done it, if a person praise someone it motivates them to keep going and and not give up on their dreams even if its hard and impossible self-esteem makes a person fight back. Finally, self-esteemed wont be always be for achievement, an self-esteem will be always on a student who are willing to do what is hard not the easy thing even though, they dont succeed and or achieve they know who they are and what they are able to do, lowers standard is better then nothing. some people may think achievement are required to praise while others think that is not, and for this reasons it doesnt be necessary to be success or achieve a gold to be praised by someone.

I am agree with Emersons statement about individuality because i can demostrate that they said is wrong, to show them what is defference between to make and to talk, and to be concetrate. Those thing i can show the people that i can doing with myself and that make me a greatest accomplishment. I feel to be myself, it is not depend what people said about me. If i want to change or to be something else in a world, i have to do what my mind say to me, for example if i wanna be a teacher. And they tell me to be a teacher is not important because their payment is trash, they just can earn $1000 each months. But if i like to be teacher do not matter what i earn. They will trying to make me confuse. Maybe they already tried it, but they could not do it , that is why they believe that i could not do it either but not all time is the same, the world change every day so i need to try to show them that what they said it, it was wrong. So it is important do not pay attention people who try to make me confuse. Also there are two defference between to make and to talk because i can believe in myself but if i just talk and to say i will do this, i will do that and i will not doing nothing. That way i can help the world even i lie myself. But if i did not said none and to show people that i change my life with my attitude. they will come at me and ask me what happend with me? because i am changing. I will tell them that i want to be something else in a world. That will be my greatest accomplishment. Even if i believe in myself i need to be concentrate because i am human and i am not perfect, i can fail with my decision if i am not concetrate. Because bad people will like to see me on ground they will tell something fun that i missing.

Im agree with the statement about the importance to have a positive attitude in life, because thats one point at favor that can helps us for work hard everyday and give the best that we can do and had a success in everything we can make and do in life. However, depend on people,how much they want have success in their life and if theyre a positive people for work hard and have what they want in their life and give a better life to their next generation. Success in life is not just to talk about the everything is going to be easy for us,but it the depend how the people think and how much they want to have succesful life,somethings youre going to feel the everythings is hard and not the way the you think but you keep faighting because you have one reason why you work that hard for give to their family a better economic and education, when we talk about a better economic and education were talking about to proper a better future for ours sons and daugheters for one day they can have everything and dont be worry about to work for have money for collage or university that one reason why people have a positive attitude and want to have a succesful in their life. Positive attitude, Change they way of people think, for example my father is man who dont have a good education but he has a positive attitude and the way he works hard for give to my family the best he can take is super wonderful, because he is showing me the when you want something you have to work super hard and put on your mind the you can do anything you want and depend if you like to do it, he is always tell me a goods advice and giving me a big lesson the i have to learn in life for have a better future. Another point the affect so much today in day is the way the people think ,depend so much how you look the things and think about it if you can really make or some people they fast get desolution when something do not work for they and the way they wanna, but everything depend how that person works and how much love him or her put for get a good result, but thats not the end of everything, people have many change and tryies in life, is something doesnt work for you have to let go and look for another change and you need to have in your mind a positive attitude the you can make or do doesnt matter how many times you try for get that job the you like or the car the you wish with all your haerth of the house of dream, everuthing depend how hard you work and how much you faight how have the things the you wish to have in your life and everything have a one reason why you work hard in your life.

Is good opportunity for the people that can not attend classes and miss school because they do not have transport to go school. But is amazing that can take one class online without attend to school thats a lot of benefit for people that dont work .Is offering a big opportunity to take the class at home and do not drive every day to the class in the school. Being able to to attend classes by home online is a good opportunity because not all school is offering the chance to take classes by home online. Taking classes online can improve the student and offering the opportunity to graduate without attend the schools and miss classes for not reason. This would be more benefit because some student skip classes when they go to school so they are losing his grades. But with the opportunity doing online student can make the class and not skip school and class for not reason. Student can learn more with this benefit doing online because they can no get distracted by his friend of the side and can get more focus in the class online. for instance The students would be better doing the class online because when they go to school they get a lot of distracted and not put attention to the teacher when they talk .But online no body is making noise by your side and interruption to you thats helping to you a lot .Is good benefit to can graduated and doing all the think well online at home. Some student can be more benefit because they have to work and be able to do online is good opportunity to all students can finish the school. For example they can finish extra work after they work a long they and be able the pass the grade doing all the step at home without go the school and miss the class offering the opportunity to do online without going anywhere just by doing online can be more benefit because can not be more stressing like in the school when you have to do a lot of work do not get the correct time to do it ,but when with this opportunity can be the best option to can finish late and extra work. and Also they dont have to find a transport to go to the school every day they only have to join online and make the work.

565,2257,57A750437C3A,"Ralph Waldo Emerson who wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greastest accomplishment"" I agree because if you do everything by yourself better things happens. Like how he saids be yourself can make you better by trying new things, so many reasons to be your own. First of all, to be yourself can make you great life or more better can open new opportunities, by saying this a refer to get ideology with a great future. A example, making yourself with rules or putting time for something you want to do can be awesome way to start, someone told me if you fight for dreams and you really want to do it, you will get it by doing yourself. Then you can be proud of yourself by doing something the you never imaginate to do it. Second of all, when you get staff done by your own can be a great example for so many kids in this world. Believe or not be an example for someone is the most accomplisment beacuase they want to do or be like you. Also by trying everyday something new can make you better. How this quote says "" Hard work beat talents when talents doesnt work hard"". Something useful is everyone learn new things by mistakes. Make mistakes is not a big problem, making a mistake means the you are trying to do it better and be better by learning how do it. Third of all, the last but not least frienships have a lot with this, one question very important in here is How can I be sure the my friends are real?. Yes, probably that can be a problem thats why be yourself is the greastest accomplishment because friends can take you down with drugs, alcohol and bads things. Thats doesnt mean the you can not have friends. That means you have to choose really well your friends because hypocristy exist maybe they want you down without future and great life. Hypocristy is the most danger thing in the world by hypocristy you can make people think about how they want to be or what they want to do. In conclusion, doing yourself can make you better and open opportunites the you never imaginate. Try to do something the you love or like thats a good way to start to be yourself.

566,2225,083E12F6B1D0,"Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. words that The British naturalist and politician John Lubbock wrote. Do we choose our own character traits, or is our character formed by influences beyond our control? My position is that we choose our own character traits. Why because Your character will be what you are and who you are. Your charcter will be what you yourself choose to do. A reason is each person has there own way of being who they are. There is diferent types of characters that make each person unique in there own way. I also think that there is character formed by influence. there is alot of character that we can have. Many have very little and many have alot of character. example some people have a very sweet chacter in something they love or some people have a diffrent charcter trait that dont like to show it . character traits is away to show your personality. When you go to a job interview the person that is taking your interview is looking at your characteristic is seeing how you are if you have a good charateristic or if you have a bad charcteristic. You are going to show your chacteristic by the way you inturduce yourself by the way you speak your body laguage. You are going to do what you feel conterble in doing. Many ask you to descibe yourself and by what you say they see if that is your charcteristic. Character Traits are one of the ways that descibe how we are as a person. For example people describe me as a shy person that likes to help that is always offering to help. I also get descibed as a person that gets mad easily but does its best to not show it as much and pretents nothing has happeaned. Thats how some people descibe me. For me charcter traits is something that is you that makes you special in some way. everywhere you go there is going to be someone seing your chacteristic. You make your own chacter, its something you do that describes who you are. Depending in how you feel thats what you going to show which is your charcter trait it all depends in us we make our own character trait in the way we feel and act. its important to always show a good atitud for we can be described in a good way and try to have some good charcter trait for we can have a good reputation in life. For example John Lubbock wrote ""your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. Is very true we all make our own character and that makes us who we are and is something that makes you speical and the way you are. Many people dont think that the charteristic is not as important they dont pay much attention to it because they maybe just like the looks but the charter has so much to say. charcter is not only in humans its also in animals. you describe a animal by its charcter by the way they act and take things. its very important to see the diffrents charateristic. Many people when they go out with someone first they ask people what kind of personality that person they are going out with or wanting know. you can tell even by there looks and there body languge what kind of chacteristic they have because everyone makes there own charater.",5,6,7,5,7,5,111,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
567,2542,3766B7A3A5E0,"There are many different ways to look at this statement. Even though Mr Lubbock does make an excellent point in his argument I do not support it. I believe that our characteristic traits have a lot to do with the people that we choose to surround ourselves with. We have all been influenced in a certain way by someone. Whether if that was being convinced into doing something that we didnt want to do or if it we were given a confidence boost to tackle the challenge ahead of us. There have been many cases where someone gets into a lot of trouble by doing something that they didnt want to do. They were brainwashed into doing what everyone around them told them to do because they were the people who they truly trusted. But in the end they where just let down by them. For example there are many known cases where some innocent teenager gets a drug addiction because they were influenced to do them by the people who they were surrounding themselves with. This one poor decision has now changed that persons entire life by someone who they probably wont even remember their name in ten years. They wont get the opportunity to play in any sports teams because of their current state. People will look down on them because of what they have done in the past. They wont get the same job opportunities as other people because of their mental and physical state. Because of this we should be able to love ourselves the way we are and we shouldnt need the influence of people around us to shape our lives, we should be forward and honest with people, if you dont want to do something they that are telling you to do you need to build up your confidence and tell them that you wont get involved in such a thing. Does this mean that you will loose a couple friendships? Sure but at least you did what was right and you were able to take control over your life and make what you think are the right decisions. Now that person is probably going to get into a lot of trouble by what they have done but you wont because you were able to take matter into your own hands and do what was right for your future. In conclusion take control over your own life and dont do what everyone tells you to do. Go with your instinct and if you believe that something is wrong then dont do it because it might change your future for ever for the better or for the worst.

This is a good intention from curfews, to protect them at the end the only beneficiaries are the teenagers. For example if they are in the middle of the night they can get a trouble , because they going to do wherever they want when nobody is watching them, for other part if curfews say not they have to respect the rules . Otherwise nobody are in the street playing or doing something good in the night, all people are in home resting or with their family doing other things, they have to apply the same for teenagers.

Often people comment about the classes that students are taking on school. They are agree that art, music, and drama should be electives because you let students think on themselves. As every person in this country we must let them take part of their own decisions. Let me remain you, when you were young there is a bunch of classes that you didnt like to take, you complaint a lot. Its the same with this classes. Students must decide what they want to do in order of their own benefit. Many students dont even care about those class and their grades look affected because schools required them to take those classes. People suggest that students must be required to take drama, art, and music classes because regarding to this classes students can earn a lot of experience in this area. For instance we are in at school!. we are connected to other schools we can make events and build good relations between students in order to let them gain experience. as soccer, basketball, baseball, and football also we can create competitions to motivate them. the kingdom university during 3 years asked to 100000 people "" How do they feel about competitions"" and the 90% of people said, competitions motivate you, is not matter what kind of competitions the human nature always wants to win. In other to this some schools are more likely to invest money on those areas. Culture is a good reason why students should be required to take art, music, and dramas classes. When we talk about culture we have to do mention that it does a huge contribution in the society. for example Tourism, some research showed that the 70% of people who travel to another countries just to know how their culture works. like in years before the music had been changing. The United States of America have long history in music like Jazz, Rock, Heavy Metal and so on. Thats why music classes should be required for students to maintain the culture of music in our country. When we talk about art everyone has heard about the famous Leonardo da Vinci and his picture of the Mona Lisa. Outside there is good amount of artist who became famous because they impressed the world with fantastic pictures. drama, our world is a age where we use the social media for many reasons and social media need authors. Example Hollywood every year produce movies. All those authors have a really good home, cars, and many facilities to live. Thats why students must be required to take drama classes because many of them can have the opportunity to enjoy a life like this.

570,3326,F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements. True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and its the cause of someones self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month. Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that cant start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they dont feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how theyre feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they dont want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who cant learn if she doesnt feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesnt feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning. Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If youre being praised for something good youve done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals. In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement.",7,7,6,6,8,8,3708,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
571,1712,4D7E52C79A3D,"Does students think that learning from home would be helpful for them? Learning from home wont be as helpful as much as you go to school and learn in the class from teacher. I dont think that students would learn anything from video or online conference because if they dont learn anything while their at school, so how would they learn from home. They might have work at home or at outside, which makes them distracted or disturbed them from their work, and they might have problems with it. Every student has the right to make their decision but this idea wont work out. Mostly, in every home there is problem which we dont want to share with anyone or we dont want anyone to know about what is happening in our home. Like fighting with mom, brother or father anyone in home or we might dont want anyone to know why are fighting. I mean people have privacy in their life or difficulties which they dont want to share with anyone, and even if they do the work from home it might not help as much as we are in school. Commonly, every student is not equally intelligent so they can understand one thing in one time. Most of the time and most student take a long time to understand one thing in this situation if they decide to put distance learning then those student might not understand clearly and of course they wont come to school, so they can have a day off. I mean if a student cant learn something from school how could he or she learn from home. However, every student want to learn more and achieve something and most of them dont even care. The person who want to achieve something always try their best to do it, but the person dont care would get a chance to not learn. I mean everyone want to relax in home because school work are really tough, but even after that every student try their best to learn and distance learning cant help it out. if you are out somewhere and youre teacher is trying to teach you in online you might not get what they are saying. However, some people might think that distance learning might help them but if they cant learn in school then how will they learn when they are not in school. I dont think if you are far away from school so you can learn anything from that. Anyway I dont think that students or the teacher might have that time to talk to every student or teacher to ask question or answer them. One teacher can handle a class together, but same teacher cant handle every student differently, so I dont think that this idea would work.",8,7,7,6,6,7,1009,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
572,2928,EA42A6028804,"People argue whether or not its a good idea for students to study or identify a carrier of their choice when entering high school. I agree that students should commit to a career of choice when entering high school because theyll be ahead in life than many other students who dont get the opportunity to chose a career they want to learn in high school and studying their choice of career at a younger age would have them college ready. Learning a specific carrier at the time when entering high school is very beneficial to students because it would have students who do chose to learn a carrier would have them very much ahead of students who their high schools dont even offer the opportunitie to learn a carrier during their years of high school. Learning and mastering a career of choice is something that students should take for granted because once mastered it can lead u to many opportunities while your in high school or have graduated. These opportunities can lead you to Paid internship programs, college scholarships, and even a Job right after high school. Students who get to study a career of choice during their high school career would prepare them for college. Having students identify a career during there high school years would give them a better feel to go to college right after high school. Your resume would look much more achievable when colleges see you have earned a certificate for mastering a career you choose to learn during your time in high school. Learning something you want to do in the future would prepare you for college because it would almost be the same as attending a college, but without all the nice technology or lab equipment colleges or universities have. Others would disagree when i say that students should identify a career of choice when entering high school and I understand why. While some parents would want there child to study a career earlier in life, other would recommend that they shouldnt be pressured in to choosing some sort of career when entering high school because it can be really stressful for the students to already having to chose a career to pick right after middle school and other parents want there kid to enjoy life as teenager and then worry about that later. The first reason I understand, but picking a career of choice is super beneficial to that student because studying it and then getting a certificate to when passed the class will lead you to many opportunities during your years in high school and would put you ahead of many others. This is why I believe students should identify a career when entering high school. It puts them ahead of the game and prepares them for college and the future. I also believe that we should have every high school in the United States offer some sort of options of careers that students can take during there high school career and that the schools can teach in all high schools around America.

574,2662,C968149003DE,So many people at my middle school want to start a after school homework club and this because studies have shown that one way to improve student achievement is to start a homework club. Well I think this idea is not going to work because student will think that they will only have to do homework at the homework club therefor when there no after school most kids wont turn in there homework. Also another problem is the volunteer work no kid wants to stay after school to help and if there only teacher I am certain that kids would lose focus. And the subject I dont think that 45 minute Are enough to learn 4 main class plus the homework thats not enough time to finish homework and learn. And many people just want to go to this homework club just to finish fast I think that people that really need it should be in this group not just cause they want to finish fast they can do that at home and after school wasting time and the teachers time. This one of the main problems I have with the homework club is that if kids go there they are only go to fool around with there friends. And not let other kids learn and do there homework and learn being a middle school er my self I have seen how most kids with there friends u would think that they are mauter but not as much. But many people say maybe if you let them they will change but so many people have goint chances but they keep doing the same thing. As a conclusion I think that this after school program has no use because homework is called homework for a reason and if u do at school they would not do at home when theres no after school so this after school program will not work for many reason like no a enough time not enough focus distractions. And people who just want ot play and not do work and volunteering kids dont want to stay extra and kids wont pay anttion to the teacher. ,6,6,5,5,6,6,2738,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

It will give them the time they need to get the diplomats or the dregrees they need for the careers the will chose after college. for the one who will be working after high school, it would give them the time they need to get to know their future jobs better.

577,3878,5132328226C2,"Afterschool Homework Club Most students do not enjoy doing their homework at home; for it can get quite frustrating. A lot of students favorite part of their school day is going home, but some other students favorite part of the day is their afterschool club. Now teachers and students are volunteering to meet with people who have difficulty in subjects or who want to finish their homework early,but afterschool. I think it is great that people are staying afterschool to help other people with school work and learning. It is a good to be a part of an afterschool homework club because it makes teachers do what theyre best at, it helps students understand certain things better, and a club made for troubled kids makes other kids not afraid to ask for help when they dont understand something. A teachers main job is to teach their students common knowledge that they will need when they become independent adults. Although the main job for teachers is teaching, they can, and should, also inspire their students. With this afterschool club students will be inspired to help others when they see their own teachers helping others to better understand something. Feeling believed in is an amazing feeling that students will feel in the club. The teachers who are helping the students arent getting paid to be their, they are volunteering to help the students because they believe that the student can learn and understand something better, with their help. The people who volunteer to help their students would also be helping their community. The smarter that the teachers make their students the brighter the future were headed towards. Not only can the afterschool homework club help teachers do their job, but it can also give students the extra help that they need to understand a subject. Learning and understanding something new is something a lot of people struggle with. Some people struggle with learning something new because the class period that they learned it in was too short. A lot of times when learning something new it is important to have time to understand it, and one class period is not long enough. The club would give students extra time to understand the subject, and possibly do the homework that the subject required. Doing homework at home can be stressful at times. A lot of times a home is loud and distracting, but with a one-on-one class with a teacher it would be quite and not distracting. There are different ways that a person learns best. Some people are visual learners and some are verbal learners. Some students dont understand what theyre being taught because of the way its being taught. A visual learner could be learning verbally, and it might just be very confusing because of it being taught verbally. The club would have teachers teaching in the students proffered way. Because of students getting extra help, more students are becoming unafraid to ask for help when they have trouble understanding something. This club makes students know that they arent the only ones that have trouble in school. A lot of people feel dumb because they cant do something properly or even understand it, but with the club they would see that they arent the only ones struggling to understand the subject. If a person that you knew was getting help from a teacher afterschool and the next day they completely understood the subject, wouldnt you want to go be a part of the club too? Most people think of afterschool clubs as a fun and relaxing activity to calm down their mind from their stressful day at school. Afterschool activities are like school, but its fun, and it is exciting. Learning can be made fun in afterschool clubs because they have students all sharing their struggles and getting help for them. The afterschool homework club would be a safe place for all the people who are afraid to ask for help, but arent afraid to be a part of a group. The club makes people feel welcome, not alone, and so much more. The afterschool homework club benefits all the people in the community. It benefits the students by giving them the help they need to succeed. It benefits the teachers by giving them a chance to inspire others to help each other. The afterschool homework club benefits the students parents because it prevents the students from coming home to complain about their homework that they dont understand.

578,3828,192D02CF8C9E,"Having good attitudes is the best way to successes. There is two types of attitudes : a good attitudes and a bad attitudes. Good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing, for example you dont agree with your boss about your paycheck, one thing that you can do is talk with your boss with a good attitude and get to a agreement or talk with a bad attitude and get fire. Good attitudes can also help during a bad or boring times. For example, you and your family are having a bad time in a trip and then you go with a great attitude and make everyone feel better. Some ways that you can be with a good attitude are : when you sleep well, when is sunny outside, when you get a gift, when you go to your favorite restaurant or you got your favorite food , when your friends go to your house, when you visit your family, when you go to a trip and your having a good time, and so many other ways. Bad attitudes can take you to the wrong path. A lot of people have bad attitude almost all the time and its really difficult to get along with them. That type of person does not have a lot of friends or they dont have friends. One example of a bad attitude is when you came to school with a lot of stress and a bad attitude and your teacher do something that you dont like, then you star yelling at him with a bad attitude and your teacher send you to guidance and you get a report card. Or maybe someone else is with a bad attitude and wants to fight and that can go really bad. Some ways that you can get a bad attitude are : when you are tired, when you got a lot of work, when its raining and you cant go outside, when someone else got a bad attitude with you, when you are mad at someone, when you are hungry and the food is bad, and some other things. When I am with good attitudes I always have the best time. Some thing that make me have a good attitude is when I got my favorite food , or a present , or when I am with my family. For example, yesterday was my cousins birthday in a really fun place, I was with a good attitude because I was playing with my cousin and then we ate really good food. Also I am with a good attitude when my family and I go on a trip, I love to travel because we can visit a lot of new places. Another example is, because my sciences teacher was with a good attitude, he give us one more day to turn in a project. There is so many benefits of having good attitudes. One of them can be when you got a important exam and you study and feel secure about it, then in the next morning you woke up with a good attitude and you take the exam felling secure about your self and with a good attitude, you are going to get a good grade. I think that the best one is having a good time because you are happy and being happy is the best felling that a person can have. In conclusion, having good attitudes can help you in a lot of thing like in work, school ,and even family reunions.

First reason why they should think about their career is because they could know some step of how to get into their career. They woukd know some steps on what to study or in other words know what classes are the right one to take. An example is that when i was in high school i didnt know what to study for. my teachers couldnt find the right classes for me to take. Most student get into high school without knowing what they would want to study for. Another example was that when i got into high school they ask me for my career i told them what i wanted to be. Once i got into 10 grade i change my mind and decided to change my career. When i try to get into my step for my second career it was already too late to apply which made me now find my own way to get into the career i wanted to be in.

Another reason is that when they dont know what to study for as their career, They dont find a way after in how to get into collage.

Last exapmple is that i didnt think about my career when i was in middle school and now in my high school year i didnt get into any of my career i wanted to study for.

In my conclusion, Most student should know at their young age what they wanna be. My advice to all the young student making their way to high school they should start thinking what they want to be.

582,626,8D1CD79C0F8D,"Thomas Jefferson once said ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing. I was so successful in life. You want to know why? it was because I was always keeping myself busy with work. We accomplish more if we are always doing something because you get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy. First, you get more work done, for example I had a science project due in one month and I decided to get working on it until I had finished it, consequently I had more time to work on my other school work. My friend, Generic_Name she is always working at McDonalds and she never takes any days off. She refuses to stay home and be lazy, therefore you will always see her working on something productive. It could be school work, her job, or anything else that benefits her. Generic_Name had a book project to do and since she was always working she accomplished more than her friend, Generic_Name. Secondly, you can be more successful, for example my cousin, Generic_Name was always exploring with cars until he found out he wanted mechanic to be his major. Since he knows a lot about cars he can always help people when their cars break down and can also make money that way. Generic_Name can later on open his own mechanic shop in the future. My friend, Generic_Name has also been very successful. She absolutely loves doing makeup on her and on other people. Generic_Names makeup looks are so amazing she has become a famous makeup artist. I also became successful when I opened up my baleada shop. Every one loved the taste of my homemade tortillas filled with beans, eggs, avocado, and cheese. Finally, you can be more healthy, for example I go out to run each morning instead of sleeping in. Running outside in the morning can be very healthy because you are stretching your muscles to start the day. Although some people may think inactivity serves a purpose, they are incorrect because inactivity can be unhealthy. My friend, Generic_Name got in shape because he goes to Golds Gym every day after work. He rather go to the gym on his free days instead of staying home watching Naruto because that will not benefit him. You can get more work done, you can be more successful, and you can be more healthy when you accomplish more if you are always doing something.

583,41,DE841BF24A2F,"A wise man always said "" Thinking out of the box can get you a better choice."" Seeking multiple opinions can help people make a better choice for several reasons. First, they will have more choices to choose due to this problem. Everybody will have a different idea because of their way to look at the problem, they might think the problem out of the box and give out some choice that you never think of. Recently, my friend Generic_Name were in a problem of what sport should he choose and we all gave out different opinions because some of us think that which sport can benefit our future better, some of us think that is important to match your hobbies and benefit to your body health after you play the sport, but we never think about the sport that Generic_Name like better. It is important to think the problem in a different way because after that you can find a better way to solve it . Second, seeking for multiple opinions can help you collect ideas and solve the problem with friends and family. It is important to think together with friends and family because it can help you with more ideas and power. Recently, my friend Generic_Name got bully in school two moths ago, Generic_Name cry in the restroom alone because the person that bully him told that Generic_Name cannot tell anybody about what happen, after he get home he told his parents and principal start to find out the person bully Generic_Name. After that, Generic_Name know it is very important to let parents know that his feeling. Third, seeking for multiple opinions can let people feel like they are not alone to this problem, most of the time people can cause the mind to do wrong things because they feel like no one want to help them and leave them alone. Recently, Generic_School did a report that said three percent of people died in the year is because they feel alone, they think that no one with help them. If everyone can also help each other when they have a problem, maybe we can make the world much better. In conclusion, seeking multiple opinions can make people make a better choice and it can also benefit other and make the world much better .",7,6,7,6,4,6,3159,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
584,53,B7A0347C68C3,"I know taking online or watching video conferencing class can be relaxing sometime, and sometimes student even pray for school to be close. but that does not mean student should take online classes or watch video conferencing , It not a good idea for student to be take online classes and I am not in favor of the idea for student to take online or watch video conferencing because they can find the online teaching to be boring and it will be very hard for student to understand the teaching of the video. Although some people might think that taking online or video conferencing class can be helpful because student can get a lot of sleep before starting the class and the student will be the one to choose the time he or she wish to take the class or watch the video conferencing. firstly why I dont agree with the idea of taking home school or watch video conferencing is because student find home school to be boring and they cant focus in the teaching of the video conferencing. like for example if the person who is teaching in the video speaks softly it will make that student feel sleeping and by the time he or she get up the video might be finish at the end of the day the student dont gained anything from the online teaching, and other student will turn on the video and still be charting with their friends on the phone while the video is playing, he or she will not focus on the video that is teaching. secondly why I said home schooling or video conferencing cant be beneficial for student is because student will find it very hard to understand the teaching of the video conferencing or the home schooling. like if the video is playing but the student dont understand the teaching of the video he or she cant get the chance to ask question about what they dont understand .And some of this video teaching sometime is really confusing the student that why other student prefer to set in class while teaching so that if he or she dont understand they can ask question about the topic. other student have their young ones at home while he or she want to listen to the teaching their young ones will be make noise so they cant get what the video is teaching about and that will make them not to understand the teaching. I am not in favor of the idea of student taking online classes because they will find it very boring which they cant focus on the teaching and it will very hard for them to understand the teaching of the video. for this way I find it very difficult for student to gained any learning from taking the online or the video conferencing class.

585,2274,98D8FF9E3C56,"The life is being more modern, people also need to improve themselves. Thats why some schools want to offer some programs which are good for students. Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. Most students who allow this plan must take courses during the summers or in the evenings or may not be able to take elective courses. This plan has two positions,some people agree, but others dont think its a good idea. Is it a good idea? It is. It is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early if the students want because they can save time, they can have new experiences, new challenges which help for their life in the future, they still can take elective courses also have vacations latter after college or work if they want. Lets start with the first reason now. Do you agree that the time is limit? The time is the only thing you cant move back. Because of this, a lot of people, especially students are thinking how to spend time helpful. These programs will help many students save time. They can save one year in school, that also means they can reach success early one year. Many people spend summer having vacations to relax, and evenings watching TV, but the other people spend this time studying. They choose have more time after success instead of have time when they havent had anything. The next reason will be the reason help students the most. Most students who follow this plan will have a lot of experiences also challenges because they must have the same knowledge in shorter time than, they will have pressure, but it will grow up ourselves. They can become stronger, independent by working on own and have more information about lessons because this time is not enough for teachers can teach everything, they must research more. The last reason refers to elective courses. Many students like these courses, but some students dont. These programs do not require to take elective courses, so some students can skip these course which they dont like or do not helpful for their career. They also take these courses after college or work if they want. They can choose also consider what is they need. Moreover, this plan dont require you skip these elective courses, you just may not be able to take these, so if you want to take courses, you can plan for this. It depends on your choice. On the other hand, many students do not agree this plan. They think it gives stressful for them, they worry about they cannot have enough lessons. But if you think that it means you dont confide your ability also dont try for your future. Sometimes, the life needs challenges to grow up and it will be interesting. To enter college or the work, all we need are knowledge or skill, not how long we took them. You can choose your way, success will come soon or later depends on you. Conclusion, we should support some schools offer these programs that allow high school students to graduate early if they can. Our life will change if we change, our success will come if we try, and it will happen early if we have a plan. After all, which one do you agree with? It is a challenge but many students can do. However, it will be fair if students can choose take or not these programs. ",9,7,8,7,6,7,2027,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
586,2760,EF2E939F92B2,"Generic_Name Pd. sol 3/21/2019 ""Commit a career at a young age gives time for students to approach their goals and advance towards the future"" During High School, many Juniors and Seniors are already preparing themselves for college, taking classes that would give them credit and would benefit them as they go, also there are some classes that would provide students lots of experiences, these experiences prepared students in a way for them to see how much effort they must put to approach their goal. The Board of Teachers in a private school have said that, ""The more early a student starts their way to a career, the less struggle is for them to accomplish it"", because at their young age they have more time, less worries and not that much of responsibility, as a person gets older the more problems and responsibilities come to them, Although students also have many struggles in school, their house etc, is more less then an adult, That is why teachers think that is better for a student to commit a career at a young age because they are less worried. The percentage of students that commit a career at a young age is high, many of this students received a schoolarships others financial help, because of their behavior and their effort,The other half of this percentage of students have a well financial situation and there is no need for help or schoolarships, although there is a low percentage of students that prefer to work instead of going to college, because of their financial situation,However many students with low financial situation have succeed at their young age because of their effort to accomplish their dreams by working hard and knowing what they want to succeed in. Commiting a career at a young age could be difficult or it could be simple, there is more students that had said that is a great idea, because your mind at a young age is envolving in everything that surrounds the student, such as important information that would benefit him, as i said, the brain has more potencial to store as much information as it can, because the student is young and is focus on its goals and there is no problems or thoughts that could disstract the student. Other students had said that is a bad idea in a way of making the biggest decisition, which is choosing what career you want to accomplish, because at that age they do not actually know what they really want. Parents and the societies have a big influence when students are choosing which path to go, some parents wants their kids to follow their steps, so they encorage their kids to take courses that would help them as they go, parents would always want the best for their kids more when its about their future. Accomplishing a career at a young age brings many benefits, one of them is that the person not longer have to be thinking about it, takes a big weight off their shoulders, also the person would have more time for the family and especially the person would have many opportunities to find a job, because that person is young and lots of doors would be open for them. As we see commiting a career at a young age has many advantanges the biggest one is that, the students approach their goals and advance towards their great future.",6,6,7,6,6,5,3504,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Seeking help and guidance make a huge different .Not only one mind that is speaking but there should be more so we talk and decade bout the issue and we can give more ideas and information. we dont need to tell our child to be followers there are leaders by teaching them these skills make a big impact . Leaders always seek help too they start off small but over the time the income until one point you have all knowledge you need but still to this day we still ask question grab more information. we can compare these skills and source to our family,jobs,lifestyles. Its not only students that need it .Having self-reliance and seeking guidance by seeking more information make us better in our jobs,lifestyles.

We would all need them reliance can be compare to leaderships standing up with you think it right for you and your career we believe that our answer is right but we dont want to be wrong but by seeking guidance and other people ideas always asking questions give you other option to choose from.

590,1719,EBEFF43F46EE,"If you could accomplish one thing in the future, what would you choose? Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. The first reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will make me feel successful. Attending college has always been a dream of mine since I was a little kid because Id always watch documentaries; in these documentaries people would talk about what they had to do in order to feel that their lives were successful, some people had the same reason which was that they had made the choice of attending and finishing college. Being able to have the chance to even attend college is amazing, not everyone in the world is given this opportunity. I know that college is a long time away for me but its coming sooner than I think. Before I know it Im going to be out of high school and out in the real world. In order for me to feel like Im successful I need to finish college. College gives you the information to be successful in the job of your choosing. To me being successful mean you never give up even when things get hard. These are all examples why accomplishing college would make me feel successful. The second reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because it will help me learn what I need to know in order to get my dream job. Most jobs out in the world require you to have a higher education than high school. College helps you learn specifically about the job you want to do when you become an adult; the job I wanna learn all about is a pediatric oncologist. Being a pediatric oncologist has been my dream job for awhile now because I think that cancer is such a sad thing; people die everyday from cancer. When I get older I want to be able to help treat and get rid of children cancer so that they an live their lives to the fullest; to me helping these kids get rid of their cancer could help prevent it form ever coming back; it doesnt mean that there is a zero percent chance that their cancer wont come back, but I want to help these kids lives last as long as possible. In order for me to actually have the opportunity to apply and receive this job, I cant just have a high school diploma. There are jobs out in the world that do not require you to have a college education; maybe your dream job may not require you to attend school after you finish high school, but not all jobs are like this. These are all examples why college will help me learn what I need to know in order to get the job of my dreams. The third and final reason why I would like to accomplish college in the future is because I wanna be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. A lot of people in my family have not attended college due to not having the funds to afford it, having to stay home to take care of a family member, and most just didnt see the point of even attending in the first place. I know that no matter what my parents would do whatever was needed to be able to give me the opportunity to attend college. Personally, one of the really big reasons why I want to finish college is because of my mom. While my mom was attending college she ended up having me; she was a single parent at the time and she did whatever she needed to provide for me. One thing she never got to do was finish college. She stopped all of her dreams just so she could always be there for me. My mom has such a big influence n my life and I want to be able to finish college for her; I want her to see that all of her hard work payed off and make her proud. Knowing I have my mom supporting me no matter what keeps me going everyday, I dont give up on things to show her that I can do anything I put my mind to. Overall, this is why I want to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college. In conclusion, not everyone may want to accomplish the same thing, everybody is different, but at then end of the day theres one thing that I want to accomplish the most. Something I would like to accomplish in the future would be attending and graduating college because it will make me feel successful, it will help me learn what I need in order to get my dream job, and I wanna be able to be one of the first and only people in my family to say I finished college.",9,8,8,9,7,8,3441,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

They are too young to think to go college. ex: Sometimes your age counts a lot when youre thinking about college because when you are older you can think clear what you want for your future. 3. Not every student have any plan to college some of them can go. but other student have different thoughts. ex: No all of the students likes go to school. so they cannot have though like have plan to take a career.. Students of high school cant expect what they want for their future, this can make harder the things because students can already start to think about college that can make more complicated, each student is different some of them want a career other dont wanna go to college they just want get a work and get money, so is impossible all the student want go at college when are too young. The experience always have point because if you dont know what you want for your future, it can make more difficult the things.

592,3883,41D9F5D10332,"I believe that students accomplish more when they are always doing something. That serves more of a purpose than not doing anything at all. Students learn more when they are doing something productive. Students accomplish more when they take action. Another reason why students accomplish more when doing something is that they get farther in life than others. Lastly they get mature and learn what life is about. That why i choose that when a students get all those thing in place the student will accomplish more that someone that is not doing anything in life in their whole lifetime. The reason I choose that we accomplish more when doing something is that we cant accomplish something when not moving doing nothing. My first reason why we accomplish more when when doing something is that when we do something we are learning. For example in the 4th grade i was really mad at math , so I took action and practiced everyday after school for the rest of the year. I would get good grade after i took action and studied every night. What Im trying to say is that i wouldnt have accomplish that if i wouldnt have done something. Another example is that studies show that students that are always doing things at home or after school do accomplish more than students that dont do anything at all. Finally they learn how to mange their time more better. Students that accomplish things get more farther in life than others. For example my aunt is a doctor and she put her mind in everything that she did. For example she took a lot of test to take and study for. So what did she do she always was multitasking. Another example is that a person that has made so many challenges in life is going to understand that you need too do something for it. Finally the reason is that students when they are doing their work they are going to understand what it means to be a adult.,and to be more mature in life. Students get mature when they start work and going to school because they start to mange their time more wisely. Like for example a students is going to work right after school and they have a lot of work to do. They make that time do do their work some other time when they have time or at work on break. Another example is that if a students have a goo example in life they will get really intelligent . Finally students that accomplish more are the students that are doing something in life other that just doing nothing. Students that are accomplish more are learning life skills. Students that accomplish more are going to get farther in life than others that arent doing anything. Students that are accomplish more things are going to become mature.

593,1615,24B8DF4DA85A,"Be active or not active in life, those are two options that we have. There is many reason why people are active in life, but there are many other reasons why people stay inactive on their lifetime. Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Staying active and with determination people have more chances to be successful in life. First of all, in reality things cant be done by them self. For instance, the first TV, car, plane, cell phone, etc... wouldnt be done with out a lot of hard work. Another example could be, the creators of all the things that we have now, they didnt stop or give up on their goals they were active and positive in the process to success. In addition, in order to accomplish great goals people must stay active and work hard for them. For example, the best basketball player of all time wouldnt have accomplish all the records with out dedication in the process. Another example, if Martin Luther King didnt do things or stayed back with out doing anything for the people, we probably wouldnt have the life that we all have right now. Perhaps most important, people have more chances to success in life if they stay active and working on good things, more than if they stay inactive. For example, a hard worker business man probably have way more success in life than a regular person that instead of working hard and do things prefer to stay back and be inactive. Some people argue that, inactivity serves a purpose. They say that, the fact that people are doing something doesnt mean that what they doing is right. This might be true; however, inactivity wont take people anywhere but to fail in life, and for success in life people must to do things constantly and dont give up. Without dedication and work people wont accomplish nothing, no matter the talent or the skills that they might have if they dont do nothing with it.

594,3451,D579D6F26A91,"Have you ever wondered if you have extracurricular activities are getting in the way of your homework time or study time and if the activities you take should be up to the school or the student and his or her family? Im going to explain why I believe the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers. My first reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because capable on choicen activities that would like to take and enjoy. For example if the school choices classes that you dislike and not enjoy you would have to be stuck with it. Also you would be very stressed that youre in that class and that stress can affect other classes in a negative way. My second reason why I think extracurricular activities should be left to the student is because idf students choose to do more activities they gain more expirence in diffrent types catagories. This is a good thing beause it allows students to test the waters and find out what thy like to do so they can think about studying in college and persuing it. For example if you have more activities you have a way better chance to find something you like than less activies. However, the school might say that if a student has more extracurricular activities it would affect the time students has for doing homework and studying. They also might say they know more about time managment but some students are fast at doing homework and are very fast at studying. So I think that the decision should be left to the student and his or her family memebers. The family and the student should know if they are capable to have many activities and still get their work done. That is why I believe the student should choose if they want to do many or little extracurricular activities.

The first impression is not the best sometimes, but that it does not mean that it can not be changed. You can not classify or judge a person for their first impression because that person can change. One reason why you do not have to say that first impression is almost impossible to change is because if the person that you are meeting is not having a good day that can affect the first impression because he/she is not going to be comfortable talking or having a conversation in that moment. If i would have to give an example it would be the history of me and my best friend. The first time when i met him was in my math class, He did not even wanted talk to me and be my partner, when i asked him about problems that i did not understand he ignored me and he did not answer. To conclude If i would have to to take a position on this issue i would disagree, the reason why i would disagree is because in my circle of friends there is 2 of them that they did not give me a good impression and if you look at us today we are good friend and that is why you do not have to say that the first impression is literally impossible to change.",5,5,6,6,5,5,3305,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
596,2973,7E48A7A7B400,"When I was in elementary school, Ive always wanted to have art lessons. Art is the lesson that I would like to share with elementary school students because it could help them in several different ways. The first way art would help the students is by making them more patient. When you are doing art and using paints, sometimes you have to wait until it dries so you can add more details and etc, that is one way that art can help them be more patient. You have to be patient when you are making realistic drawings, because if you draw fast you might forget to add important details and the drawing may not come out as good as it would if you had drawn it with patience. Another way that it helps the students being patient is that they also sometimes might have to redraw it if the drawing does not come out as good as they thought it would, and that requires patience, especially if make a mistake when you are about to finish it. And also, when they are working in groups they might have to explain for the rest of the group what are their ideas and how they want to do the project, which also requires patience. The second way art would be important to students is by making them more creative. When you are making art you have to be creative and think a lot. Being creative wouldnt only help them at school, it would also help their future. For example, if the student dream about their future, then it would help them to think more and be creative about what they want to do. Being creative would help them in several ways. And lastly, art would help them be focused. When you are drawing you have to focus on what you are doing. If you lose the smallest bit of focus, you can make a mistake and might have to do everything again. Being a more focused person would also help them in life. And also, they woul need to focus in the directions when doing their work. In conclusion, art would be helpful in several ways, It would help them to be a patient, creative, and focused person.

By extending two hours of school day, students for sure need to take a rest, take a shower, some students need to do chores, and also focus on their goals after school. If we extend two hours of school day, then students would not be able to focus on their education, because the brain cells need a break and need to refresh itself. Furthermore, if there is 4 days of school and 3 days of no school, then students will forget what they studied 3 days ago. In Afghanistan, schools adopted a four-day school week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Therefore, we are comparing the grades and attendance of students. With extending two hours of school day, this system had effect students educational life. Students are not showing up to school and they skip school because of the new system. This idea had discrease the number of attendance and the grades of most of the students. Finally, the regular school days and regular school hours are more beneficial then the new idea of extending two hours of school. If we want to focus and have good attendace, therefore we should not extend the school hours. In conclusion, we should keep the school days and school hours as it is.

There are many successes people out who had a hard time and that made them feel down and be sad but that did not stop them from working hard and have a good attitude to other people. For example,one day i had a very bad day when i was outside,then this very nice old man came bye me smiled and waved is hand and i did the same thing and that made me in a good attitude this is way when you see someone who is not feeling good go and take to him. In a other hand,my bother had a bed day in school so we were going home in till we seen a very old Lady sharing to cross the rode, but she cant so we want to help her, and she told us some positively words and that made my day and his. when you help other people or even show a smile or do something that will make someone be in a good attitude is thee bast thing that will make you feel good and them two. When you show a good attitude when you are having a difficult time the makes you a patter person,and everyone will love you,but when you are showing a bad attitude no one will like you. For example when i was waling to school this kid comes up to me and start saying words that made me mad and i had a difficult day,but i still showed good attitude to my people. when you have a good attitude,during a difficult time is a good thing people will learn from you people will was you as in example you will make new friends,will have a good job in life people will respect you even if your mad dont show it and make people mad and spread nigtivety all round just smile and make people feel good and if you have a bad day at dose not mane you have to make other people made with your attitude.

Professional piano players gets most peoples attention by knowing the right keys for the music that the piano players are playing. In addition, There are many tutorials of how to play the piano and learning the right key on social media to begin or improve your piano skills, due to technology. As a result, Pianos has been used frequently in the 1960s for music and people still listen to it everyday in the radio in their automobile. But sometimes Smooth jazz with a piano in the background is played at a cafe and restaurants to relief the stress that people are having in their personal lives. But there are way more instruments than just the piano. A saxophone is fun to use and its kind of similar to a piano according to the similarity of what music type the instrument is used on, except for rock, rap, and maybe orchestra. The saxophone is famously known by smooth jazz, jazz, and night jazz and night jazz are commonly used in New York cafes at night and other states. Next, the saxophone is similar to a trumpet, trombone, and tuba by blowing on the top part of the saxophone and at the same time using your both of your hands to make a rhythm. However, an electric piano has more than 20 buttons of instruments to choose from. It has guitar, trumpet, flute, clarinet, and even a saxophone for a different sound for the keys just for the people who want to change their style. In addition, Saxophones can be taught in music class in middle school, high school, or just a music school in general. It takes a couple of years to practice for beginners or couple of months to practice a new music for experts. But if you master a saxophone, thats where the fun part starts. You can create relaxing jazz instrumentals for people to listen to for meditation and stress relieving. And you can also be well known for doing those kinds of stuff. But, there is a last instrument that is really famous and also really fun to use. There are different types of guitars to choose from dealing with music. The acoustic guitar is one of the most calm sounding guitars in the world because it is used to make sad music and also relaxing. This guitar is fun to use by learning how to know which strings you should use first in order to make a good song or music with a acoustic guitar in the background. Next, the distorted guitar is mostly well known by rock and heavy metal. These guitars need to be plugged on an amplifier for it to work and they are loud. But thats what heavy metal fans like such as Intensity. The clean guitar is mostly used for country music and soft rock. This is another type of guitar that people really like the rhythm and can listen to it nonstop.

He want to see if we are responsible with our own work and left to lose the time just little things, he just want that his people can make their dreams. When he wrote this people was scare because their people was slave before Abraham Lincol become president of the United State. This show three reason why he wrote this. First, Thomas Jefferson spend his time with us because he want to see how his people really following his wrote. Many people dont think about what they can do in their life, if we still spend time with other people we dont accomplish our own dreams, sometimes people are shy,and scare with their dreams because other people can bother them because they can accomplish their dreams or may be they dont believe in them. Some people cant acommplish their dreams because they think that is lot stuff but the reason is that they never try, if they can accommplish their dreams. Second, if we look and read carefully we can find more about this wrote. We really cant thinking about because we dont have commitment to make our own dreams better. Some people are in school but they dont see the opportunity that we have for make a lot stuff in the future. We just go at school because our mothers dispatch us at the school. If we used about Thomas Jefferson wrote we can learn how we have work hard for make our life much better. We just have to think just in the our future and study more for have a good grade and accomplish the dreams we wish. Third, in this time we have much time in our own life for do a lot stuff because we are freedom. But we just think to go out with friend and have fun, nobody care their dreams in this time. They spends their time in party and doing lots stuff with our friends. If we still doing the same things with our friends we never get something better in our own life. We need to have more commitment about what we really want in our future. In conclusion, we can be better than other people because we are young and we can do more stuff. We can teach them thst we can do all this stuff, if we can think better. We have a good concentration in all what we do.

So maybe, some people are wrong maybe having technology isnt so great after all. Over time people stop talking to each other. Stop focusing in school, families, friends, relationships, All because of technology. If there was no technology there would be no social media. People see thing online that will make then mad and always want put it on other people and it all makes it a big problems. The relationships with those people then gets broken and never want to talk to each other again.

607,2059,FC9DA73D1EA0,"Even in classroom everything catch students attention! Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home? I strongly believe that there is no benefits from attending to classes from home. Next I am going to illustrate three reasons for saying that. First, by taking online classes at the end of the semester students do not learn anything. Second, students most of the time get distract very easily, they dont focus on what they are suppose to be focusing on. Last , is more convenient when someone is teaching you literally face to face. To begin with, sometimes students dont learn anything in classroom imagine in front of a computer. In other words, being at home students will do everything in a rush just to finish it quickly and go do something else. Another consequence is that they will not put any interest in the classes and later, when the time to show your knowledge comes, they will not know what to do. For Example, in my case when I am learning something something in the computer I feel like the light of the computer blocks my mind. To continue, is very easily for students to get distracted by something. Taking online classes at home means having access to any electronic device to distract them like, cell phones, same computer that you are using, TV, etc. For example, sometimes when your family sees you at home they will tell you to take care of your siblings; the student will have to be supervising the kids and not focusing enough in the classes. imagine that in the classroom friends distract students at home that will be more terrible because young students always have friends playing video games at their home. At last, is more convenient to be learning in a classroom where you can see the teacher. For example, In my case I like to interact with the teacher and my classmate about the topic that we are learning, to get better understanding and sometimes to get other viewpoints. Therefore, is more efficiently to be seeing the teacher literally teaching you to get all the knowledge needed to pass the classes. Most of the time that students are learning somethings in the computer they tend to forget it right away. In conclusion, being in a classroom and interacting with the teacher and classmate is the best way of learning, getting all the information needed to pass the classes. By taking online classes at home the only thing that is going to happen is losing the semester by not being able to score what is needed to pass. Electronic distraction is more available at home and get students attention very easily. Attending to a classroom is more convenient and better way of learning and get educated the way it should be. It is not just about classes but also how to interact with people and and everything that is needed outside in the world to be educated and successful in life.

608,3359,7F336F4B9442,"Yes,I agree failure plays in the pursuit of success. Some people when they fail they learn what they did wrong and next time they fix it. If they dont understand or learn from there mistakes. They cant get success in there life. If anyone did any mistake try to fix it. If you cant fix it. Get help from your family or your friends. When i was in 9th Grade. I dont like math. Because i dont understand math question. I read my question and find mistakes. What i did wrong. Then i fix my mistakes. I do my work again and again. I do my work very hard. I ask my teacher about anything that i dont understand. She help me lat to learn math. Because i did my work hard now i get the success. Now i am good in math. When i came in United State. I dont Speak and understand English. I made many mistakes to write the work or speak. I try my best and I learn English from my teachers from my friends. Any word i dont understand i look in dictionary. If i cant find word in dictionary i ask my teachers. I speak English at home with my brother and sister they fix my mistakes and its help me to speak better English. Some people when they loss they dont try it again. Because they think that we are not good at this. Cause of that they cant get success. peoples who are around them they need to help them motivate them so they can try it again. like Sport coaches motivate there team before they match. When someone motivate other they get energy to do something. Dont be afraid to loss next time try with more power. Everyone loss in there life and they learn from that. Reasons why people fail. Because no one understand them so they think that no one care about them. people need to understand other problems and help them. Tell them that you make this mistake try to fix this and you will be better. When someone break his/her leg. Then he/she is so afraid to walk. because he/she think that its very painful. Then someone help his/her put his/her hand on the shoulder. Then they slowly slowly put weight his/her leg. Like this you dont need to lose enthusiasm in your life.

610,3053,6C802D3F5F2A,"One topic that is frequently debated is ""Does true self-esteem come from praise or does it come from achievement"". Some people think, that praise that is given for deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. They believe that the source of true self-esteem is achievement. I believe that the source of true self-esteem is by praising a students work because that could help them grow more independent. By praising a students work, they are going to be able to; work efficiently independent, have a bigger self confidence, and learn better. First reason, When a students work is praised that helps them achieve there work more efficiently. It emphasizes that they are capable of working independent and being able to have a good job. When some one is praised for their work, it makes them feel good and makes them want to do more work. A students work should not get praised for their work if they didnt put any effort in the work because that would just make them want to not put any effort in the work, because they will think that they would get the same grade as someone that actually tried and actually wanted to get a good grade for something that they put so much effort into. Second reason, When a student has a big self confidence that helps them get their work done more constant and with more effort because they know that they can do it and that are capable of having a good grade. when a student is willing to put a lot of effort into the work. their work should be more praised. praising a students work can help them have a by self confidence, which can help the students learn more. when a student is willing to learn that is the true motivation that is considered being able to achieve more work and do it more efficiently and with more confidence. Third reason, When a students is willing to learn a lot and are always on track, paying attention, and turning in work on time. and always putting a lot of effort in school, those kinds should always be recognized and praised, because they show how mature they are and how willing they are to graduate and have a good job. If a student is willing to learn and put a lot of effort in work, that makes them mature because it shows how willing they are to learn. other students dont care if they graduate or not because for them being ""popular"" and not listening to the teacher, and disrupting the class and doing what ever they want it more important than learning and getting an education. Having a strong self confidence, being independent and willing to learn more are some examples of praising a students work. when a teacher shows an appreciation to their students it shows that they care about them and it shows that they are willing to help them carry on and push them forward and being their when they need it, and that makes the students want to go to class everyday and want to learn because the teacher is fun and knows how to work with students very well. and that is why it is good to praise a students work.

Self reliance is very important for person to become independent. If one dose not trust themselves how will they grow. for example, A famous quote by Micheal Jordan says ""You miss 100% of the shots you dont take"". this quote eludes to the fact that as an individual it is important to have self confidence in their decision making, because if you dont take a risk in making your own decision you will 100% miss the shots you take.

For example choosing your own apartment isnt anybodies elses job but yours. Choosing an apartment is very important and one must have self reliance in order to make the right decision for them selves. In conclusion being self reliant is the most important skill you could have, while, I could see the other side saying that going to an expert is the best way to make a tough decision while that may be true, they will not always be there for you.",7,6,7,7,5,5,1809,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Many schools look for the best for you to graduate and to have the best paying job, like I think its a great idea that the school lets them go out to discover many things that we dont even know and things we never even knew that it excited at all. Students this days dont even know what they want. I would and will do it of convincing my principle of school to let kids to explore bunch of things like I said before like trying to take them to field trips for them to learn how to use credit cards and take them out to explore nature and study countries. The oppurtunities to discover will take him to the highest of knowing what he will really want in his future and college for a fact that many kids dont take lead for being scared.

Lets say principle or manager to lets explore new things like better paying wage job like that you wont be killing yourself. That would help of us thinking if we learn something we love it we can even make our own business and will make lots of money. that will be a fact why asking your principle for many things of going out to explore bunch of things, like that you wont be worrying about money, paying stuff, and wont be dealing with bosses because I hate that they pressure you so much. If I ask to explore I would love to learn to read panels of when they build houses and buildings because they make a lot much money since their isnt much people to do that. If your parents dont afford shouldnt be a problem if you have good grades you can earn scalerships to pay for them, You just worry about going out and finish high college of 4 years and enjoy it because you will definitely miss it after wards.

Activity means when you are doing something like playing sport, going outside, or participating in some type of competitions. There a lot of activities, you can choose and participate in it. My favorite activity is playing with my friends at national parks. The choice, I chose is playing with my friends at national parks because it keeps you healthy and unstressed. To start, one reason I chose is that playing outside keeps you healthy. For example, I had one friend like some years ago, but now we dont talk because we kind a faded, so we used to play a lot. One time my health was getting bad because I stayed at home all the time and doing nothing then I talked to my parents about my health and they said that I should play outside with my friends, go somewhere special where you havent been. Then, I went to the parks and played there tag, played hide and seek, and played soccer. I had fun and after some months, my health got better and I just continued playing those 3 games. Its important because nobody really wants their body to have some problems and then they regret, so thats why you should go outside and play with your friends. In addition, other reason, I chose is that playing outside doesnt give you a stress. For example, in 2016, I had this big stress about school and about homework and what we do in classroom. I just couldnt focus on my studies and got like bad scores on the test. Then I tried to find the way to get out of the stress and it said that you should go outside, do activities with your friends that you like. I asked my mom about this and she said yes to me then I started to go outside with my friends everyday and I was kept forgetting about my school and homework which was good for me. I didnt have any stress after in 2016. its important to be not stressed because then it affects on your study and also it affects your health, so thats the other reason, you should go out and hang out with your family and friends. In conclusion, playing outside helps you not stressed out and keeps you very healthy. As a result pf these reasons will help you in your life and honestly these two reasons are actually reliable, you just have to follow them and there you go, your life will be amazing. Playing outside and doing more activities help you a lot and it doesnt give you any bad day or anything like obviously you dont want any and bad situation to be in your life, so follow them.

In my opinion, the former Birtish Prime Minister Winston Churchill was right about his statement, saying that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Because in life, before you achieve any of your dreams or goals, youve to pass through some difficulties. Some people may disagree with Winston Churchill saying because theyve not experince any hardship, or any failure in life before. The reason is because they were born with silver or gold spoone in their mouth. They dont even know how hard ship is or looks like. Those people have no idea how it feels to be a failure, or a loser, or to even loss enthusiasm in life. Even though, some of them are rich today, but they when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and they even lost hope in themselves to the point that they couldnt believe that they will make it in life because of the stuggle or hard ship they when through. In addition, failure plays an important roles in our pursuit of success. The reason Im saying this is because if you dont have any experince of failure or without the loss of enthusiasm, you wont know the important of that wealth you have or your parents has. For example, my mother once told me her story that when she was in Africa in my country Liberia, she when through a lot of difficulties, disappointments, and hard ship during the civil war and after the civil war. According to my mother, she said things was really hard on her, and she said that she had no one to helped her to the point that she used to asked people in the community for food to eat just so she and my oldest sister can be able to salveged from hunger.

What can change us can be the people around us, the things around us, and even the friends we make. A other thing that can influence us is our family since DNA can give us some of our parents personally and the way they treat us can change our personally as well.

617,2789,F758E275C993,Generic_Name Todays technology allows people to do many different tasks without having contact with others in a positive way. Technology today is now making it easier for us humans to do things and also showing us what the furture could look like in a couple of years. Why would this be a negative thing ? if people are just trying to make are lives easier. For an example lets say you need to get some where but fast and you dont have a ride there is now a app where you send your location and give the address to place you need to go and somebody will take you. Technology is such a great thing and its becoming greater each and everyday. There are many different types of apps that you can download on your phone today for anything. lets say that your at home and your really hungry but you dont want to leave the house you can download an app called grubhub that will make sure you dont miss a meal. what is grubhub its an app that delivers food from anywhere. All you do is tell the person what you want to eat the location of the place to pick up the food and your address so they know where to drop it off. And its that easy this thing that we call a phone can make all this happen with a little bit of typing. these apps are for free too but it may cost for the food but not everything is free in life. Computers are also a big part of technology. Computers and laptops are used everyday could be for school for work for anything. Computers help out a lot in school for anyone who needs to do research and any type of information he or she did not know about. Laptops are great aswell its a computers that folds and is for on the go great for anyone that travels a lot or somebody that works on computers alot.

618,670,ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. Its like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family. First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important. Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). Ive seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing. Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However youre just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world youll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad. In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has its flaws it also has its pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything. This is everything on why I think we accomplish more by being active. ",9,8,8,8,9,7,2322,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
619,1616,3651697D855B,"FAILURE PLAYS IN THE PURSUIT OF SUCCESS. I agree with the statement by the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who said that "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". The word ""failure"" is been pictured as been a disapointment to family, friends or to oneself. Mostimes,everybody wants to succed in anything they do, but faces some challenges at the process to acheive that expected goal. This challenges are not necessarily proposed to affect you in a bad way, but sets a room for improvement and perfection. Failure brings a feeling of confidence to a person, working on a project for a long time and fixing mistakes you came across. Makes an individual confident,understanding everything that concern that work and feeling more relaxed doing it without so much anxiety. Mr Rubio, was told to come up with an Architectural plan for a building close to a water fall. Rubio knew this project was close to impossible for him to complete this task, but he accepted it and started making the building plan. After he taught he came up with a suitable plan for the building, it got rejected by the state building commitee, because they asked him why certain things were placed this way and he couldnt answer effectively . He had to go back and identify hes faults in the building plan, and come up with a bettter one. Rubio had sleepless nights, communicating with various Architects and Civil enginers to get some idea on hes work. When Rubio was convinced he was ready to take the project to the board meeting he felt confident in himself and knew he could explain evrything corncernig hes building plan to the comitee. When he turned in the drawing, and was asked some certain questions he quickly answerd them with absolute confidence and got approved. Secondly, the more you face challenges life throws at you makes you stronger. If everything in the world moved in a positive way we wont invent things inorder to satisfy our human needs. Isaac Newton and other scientst encounterd a problem and decided to solve this problems by making inventions. So work could be done faster, reduce Man power and done more effectively. Before isaac Newton got the light bulb to work , he failed ninety nine times of hes experiment. This failures didnt stop him from acheiving hes goal, he kept on striving hard making research and later came up with a long lasting light bulb. Which helps us see clearly in a dark place. Although it takes time, to achieve this goals after failing. Most people would get frustrateed and quit, there is an old saying ""nothing good comes easy"". To achieve whatever you desire in life, you have to be ready to encounter difficulties and failure, but approching this problems knowing that you are going to get better it just takes time and patience. After acheiving this goals what would be seen is your acomplishments rather than your failures. ",7,6,8,7,6,7,707,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

School districts programs would be making a big mistake on allowing high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional 4 years. If they allow high school students to graduate in three years , they would be making everything harder in the Generic_School because students would have to put more effort than ever on passing their classes and the SOL. In any other state would agree on graduating high school students in 3 years because their rules are different from the the state of Virginia, For example, in Virginia high school students are required to have their SOL passed with more than 400 points, and the 22 Credits instead of graduating for high school. Other states like Kentucky or Chicago will agree to this because they are required to have 22 credits for their graduation , and it would not be that hard to get 22 credits in 3 years. It would be a a bad idea to allow students to graduate in 3 years instead of 4 because students would not like to come back to school in summer to do more work, get the credits they need, and make the SOL , as a student i would not like that to happen because we would not get a lot of time for vacations in summer to spend with my family, and i would not like to take courses during the evening , it would be like to be doing a lot of extra work. People in different states would like to allow this new rule of graduating high school students in 3 years because they can prepare them more everyday doing their work so they can graduate faster in 3 years .

624,2548,39492CE9549E,"Teachers can justify students knowledge more accurately than students. Teachers are very experienced compare to the students because they gained so much knowledge in their life. By doing the teacher designed projects, students can learn something that they did not know about. Teachers would know what topics they really need to focus on and what are the most important things they need to know about. Students summer projects should be designed by their teachers to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being effective during the summer break. Teachers know the academic ability of their student because they know how the students answers some specific types of questions, they know how the students think and understand. For Example, In my fifth grade there was a math teacher named Generic_Name. Ms. Generic_Name and I spent so much time with each other to discuss my mistakes on a test, She asked me do to test corrections on a paper. I solved all the questions correctly without a time limit, She came to me and said, ""I knew you could do it, because I have seen you working very hard these days"". Then, I realized that I knew how to solve these problems but I was scared to complete the test before the timer goes off because I did not know I could complete everything. This examples describes that the teachers know our academic ups and downs than ourselves. They also know what we need to learn to succeed in our class, So when they design a project to their students they make sure that the students are going to be effective on their break and learning something new which will help them in their future. Summer projects of the students should be teacher-designed to make sure that the students are hardworking even during the summer break. Teachers know the capacity of hard work we do in our class, they observe the amount of effort that we put into different things like talking, reading, writing and singing, etc. For example, one of my teacher in 10th grade was really nice to me, she always used to ask me about my hobbies and interests. I had a presentation in her class and I went to ask her for help the day before the presentation because I was preparing for almost a month, I wanted to ask her if I did any mistakes in the slides. After I showed her my slides, she gave me a big hug an said ""I know how hard you worked for this presentation, I gave you a hard project to see is you are capable to do it or not. Even though you came to United States two months ago, you did a fantastic job"". I was very happy to hear her saying that I did good and on the day of my presentation I felt really confident on my work. This example explains how the teacher knew that I worked so hard to do my best. By assigning me a hard project based on my level of understanding, I worked hard to understand and analyze every single detail. That helped me to gain confidence on my self and my level of hard work improved a lot. When teachers design the project they make sure that the students are trying to work hard and they want to see how your working level is improving. Summer projects of the students should be designed by their teachers to make sure that the students are being responsible for their work during the summer break. when teachers design the project they know how long it is going to take the students to complete the project and how well focused and responsible a student need to be while doing this project. For example, My history teacher in 10 grade was very strict, she always wanted our whole class to turn in everything that she posted online in one day. After 2-3 months of struggling in her class, everything was going really good till the last day of that academic year. All of my work was completed on time. This example says that even though I worked really hard in the beginning, when it came to the end of the year I was really happy for being responsible for my own work. By learning how to be responsible from that teacher, helped me a lot in all of my other classes too. Summer projects given by our teachers can make us feel responsible for ourselves, by doing the projects teach us how to be focused and concentrated to get them done on time. when the students design the project they take it easy because most of the students just pick something they already know or they already feel confident on, which will not make them feel responsible. Teachers are very experienced to know how students think about something, they can understand what students know and what we do not know academically. They always try to teach us how to build our academic skills. They want the students to be in an amazing position, they always want to see the best from us because they know how the student are. Summer projects of the students should be teacher designed to make sure that they are being effective, hardworking and responsible for their work during the break.

627,2470,C868C220A380,"I disagree,and here on my reasons. If you just believe on your imagination then knowledge it wouldnt end up go for you. 1,people would think your crazy. 2,people would not even believe it would even work or would ever come true. Lastly,people would just think its plain old dumb if you believe in that. I think people would think your crazy because if you keep living on your imagination then youll get to stcuk in your own little games your in,and youll sometimes forget what the real world thinks of you. The worst to come is that youll get to scared to come to even go out into the real world. Knowledge is a powerful thing that everyone has,and its more powerful than your own imagination. If yo keeping thinking about your own little world your own little world you live in,then you would just forget on how the real world is a scary place. Second of all,If you have a big imagination,people would not even believe that it would ever come true. Reson number 1,people would just believe in whatever you do. Think about it,their are so many ideas that just shut down,like how bills get made but they dont even get to the second step of becoming a law. Reason number 2,Everyone judges on what you think and what you believe. Some might agree,but most of all they just think your werid or crazy. So yes, its scary to think on what people believe in what you imagine. Finally,People would just think your plain on dumb. If your imagination gets to out od hand,people would just think your dumb or disagree with you. Yes,its werid or even sad to have people judge or think your done with your own fantasy. People wont take you seriosly. And if they dont take you like you mean business,then they just wont talk to you at all. And your left with nothing but your own ideas. So,its risky to have a really big imagination because people would just think your plain on dumb or they might take your ideas and leave you with nothing. In conculsion,I dont think it would be a great idea to have a big imagination. Knowledge is best because people wont judge you,they wont think your crazy,and they would believe you a 100%.

628,3455,E70DD00622DB,"From my personal experience back in middle school, I had to use technology for many different reasons. One of the reasons were for research purposes. I was able to use technology as a tool to provide information on my assignments and projects. So far technology has made a positive effect in my life not only in school but in real life. Technology has helped me accomplish and complete many difficult task in life. I believe that technology has made a positive effect on peoples lives; consequently, it makes peoples lives a lot easier and convenient. One reason that technology has a positive effect on people is that they are able to study without having to go out on a library and pay for books or a tutor to teach them. For example, people who are disabled or unable to travel out of their houses are able to go online and research for books and look for a site to teach them what they need to learn. The availability to go online and research for information also helps students who are too busy to go outside and ask others for help. Many schools started providing laptops and iPads to students who are unable to connect online. Schools are using these electronics because they provide an easier way to help student learn and complete work. Technology can also help people do many other things online other than researching for information. Furthermore, technology may also be used as a way to shop whatever and whenever. For example, eBay and amazon is an online shopping website for many things such as: furniture, clothes, food, and many other reliable things. This has made it a lot easier for people to purchase items that they want at any time. Online shopping helps a lot of people who are looking for items that cannot be found in local stores. For example, many custom equipments and items can only be found online and in places that may not even be located in your place. Not only does technology may be use as an online tool, it may also used as a way to communicate to others in the world. Lastly, communication has been a major part of the world; in addition, technology has been one of their ways to communicate. For example, our military has improved a lot throughout the years due to the inventions of many technologies. Technologies such as: cellular devices, radar, satellite and many other communicating tools has helped us win wars and accomplish many things around the world. Another reason why technology has had a positive effect on people is that they use it for emergency purposes. For example, if an adult needs to call out of work for the day because of family problems, he may use his cellular device to call and inform his supervisor about it. Many people say that technology is a way to showcase yourself as a lazy person and I disagree with that. I believe that technology allowed many people to accomplish and complete many task. Technology is not only important to the civilians who are either students or adults who are working in the industry, but it is also important for the military who are using these tools to provide protection to our country and keep our people safe. In conclusion, technology has had a positive effect on peoples lives and that is due to many reasons such as online researching, online shopping, and wide spread communication.

By Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in proplem, and get to finish on Time . First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us, Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time. Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone.

631,2555,C656A870B2B7,"Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college or the work force one year early?. In many schools districts offer programs that allow students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. This program make students to take classes that can help them to graduate on time, and many student take courses during the summers or in the evening. This is a bad idea making students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. First, when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course. For example, many students are interesting in elective courses, but they not got enough time to taking elective courses because they are take the basic courses for they can graduate on time. When students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting. In conclusion, students need four years in high school for they can take courses where they are interesting and they can start to grow up in that courses. Secondly, student are not joy in they last year of high school. For example, school where are make student to graduate in three years, in they last year student have to take courses and SOL for they can graduate on time, if they dont past students most retake, and this make students frustrate. This program is making students to rush. But if they fail any classes that make students add more classes to they last year and all this make student to no joy they last year in high school. In conclusion, Last year for students dont have to be the worse year. In other hand, there are people say, student just need three year in high school, for student can enter college or the work one year early. They argument, that student with three year are ready to graduate and enter college or the work, because many student may finish with their courses and SOL in their third year and the last year they dont do nothing. This argument is incorrect because in the four year students are doing what they need to finish and they planing where they wants to go if college or work. For example, students want to graduate on time, and they need to catch up or retake anything they can do it in the last year. In conclusion, student need a four year of high school for they can get anything what they have to be done. In conclusion, put this program in school is a bad idea because make students to finish high school in three years. Because when students are try to graduate in three years, students may not be able to take elective course and student are no joy they last year of high school. Because when students just take the basic courses they are not make progress in which courses they are interesting and student are not joy in they last year of high school.

But for the work weeks are better because they are going to have more time or one more day for have fun with their family and they dont have any problems because they just have to stay two more hour and they going to have one more day off and that is better for they, because is like that they are working that day ,and they get the same pay and the workers just go to work and then go home.

To truly understand what thee author is trying to is saying you must understand that to say that you have mastered something is to be able to do it without failer. In order to grow you must set goals for your self. Even if those steps that you take are small they help you walk the path of achiving greater things. Not everything comes easy it may take years to master or even learn, but with the right amount of confidence and self confodince you can reach mastery. If you can ride a bike than learn how to ride a mottercicel, if you are able to make a cupcake than learn how to bake a cake, if you know how to float then learnand teach your self how to swim. Small tasks like these can help you improve skills that you already know and have. By improving those skills you can reach higher places and do bigger things. Untill you push your self you will never reach the goals you set but with the right amount of dedication you can reach your goals and move beyond what you already know. Just becuase you cant do one small task doesnt mean that you can not master it you havr to keep trying and trying till you can master it but until then you will never grow.

634,3432,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us. New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think its also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes. Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation. Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing. My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents wont be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents wont have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that dont they are going t get used to it. Thats going to help every students and people from outside are goin to see the changes in the school and others schools should start doing the same for their students.

635,3196,495A94390744,"Technology is a super useful and daily component we use in our daily lives,however in my opinion technology is being misused and taken advantage of by society. For example your social life becomes different, it gets addicting, or changes you as a person, it shows that people change overall. Those are some of the many reasons why people take advantage of technology. Technology can change your social life, for example you stop communicating with friends and your social skills start to grow weak,such as confidence and being specific while talking. Secondly technology can be an addiction or something people depend on a lot. For example spending hours on hours on your phone or a computer could be consider addiction. While taking tests or quizzes you cant depend on technology to help you and that shows that you depend on the internet. At last technology changes you as a person. Another words whatever you see on the internet it becomes real to you which means, now youre living in a fantasy instead of reality. It also makes you think differently instead of using your brain and you also depend on the internet way much more. Technology can be useful and can save our life sometimes. One out of the two reason why technology is useful is the time your saving. For example if you have to get work sent to your boss, the internet comes in handy, or if you have a project due at school you can also use the internet to turn it in on time. Technology will forever be useful for educational purposes. For example if you need any type of information you can find it on the internet. Theres a lot of things you could learn on the internet also. Technology can be a very inconsistent feature for people, therefore it can benefit people and change someones life in a negative way. Use technology wisely because it brings a lot of negatives with it. Theres many ways to solve the problems that come with the usage of technology. Your limitations to the usage of technology could be lowered so the addiction doesnt get out of hand. The things you use technology for should be only things that benefit you, therefore it doesnt become your social life. Always try to be yourself and dont let things on the internet change you because technology is will forever be here and will always change, therefore you dont want to adapt to it for the rest of your life.

Caming the summer break the students wait it with antusiasm, and work hard to finish the schools work and enjoy summer break, it help them as a relajation after a schools stress, they have to forget the school by a mommet, and relax their brains. Second reason, during the schools time the students doest have a lot of time to spend with their family, and the summer break is a good time of the year to spend it with their dear, persons, friends, classmate, girlfriend, and family. After it, the students are more prepared to star the schools year concentred at what they have to focus in the school with a clean brain ,and do all the schools work. Third reason, some students have some obligations in their homes, for example some of those are: pay cellphone, pay room, buy food, and pay car, so some student take advantages of the summer break to make some money to helps them to pay all their obligations in their homes, and dont take the schools time to spend it in other obligations, and take their time just to teh schools. Finally, the student doest need the summer break shorter, they have a lot of things to do during the summer break, and it wouldt be justly to them, I am againt to the educators that feel the summer break is too long.",6,6,6,5,5,5,1443,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Second if people ideas are being ignored then the people ignoring are taking away their freedom of speech. third people should have the right to say if their idea is good or not. However people are being ignored and not having a chance to speak and have to listen to someone ideas instead of standing up to people and telling them their ideas to see if people would agree. If authorities wont let people put down their ideas then they are breaking the law of freedom of speech and denying people to speak and say whats on their mind.

644,2783,079FDB42E429,"Some schools offer distance learning as a option for students to attend classes from home by a way of online or video conferencing. Schools offer this so that students who are troubled or dont like coming to school can still have a right to to learn and it also helps students who are very sickly to have access to all their classes and homework that they missed when their not at school. Some students can not focus in class because they are easily distracted by other students and by these distractions they end up getting bad grades and it causes them to lose hope in school and even what they want to become in life. they could also have something happening outside of school that could affect them to not want to be in school anymore and they can also get bullied by other students which would make them stop coming to school and some kids are just better off staying a home and doing classes at home. These online and distance learning classes can help students get back on track with school and catch up with their work that they missed. The students who want to be home schooled can wake up at anytime that they choose and do the work that is planned for them and the ones that dont like coming to school or the ones that get bullied can stay at home and get their work done without missing class and getting bad grades because of them not being their to do classwork or take test and quizzes. The students who are taking these classes can benefit from these a lot. These programs can help students be able to their work on their own time and a have teacher who can teach them but online like at school and this can help students become independent in being able to do their work and help them stay away from trouble that they could be having at school and give them confidence to be able to do their work. I think this can benefit students because they are in the comfort of their homes and its like a regular class but it just online and you could get all your work done and by that you earn good grades. If students who dont like coming to school,sickly and get bullied,always miss class and get bad grades because their are not their to take tests or quizzes then these online and distance class can benefit them to do work at the comfort of their home. It will also persuade them to not give up on school and give them a right to get their education before they throw it away. These online classes and distance classes can help teach these students as if they were in school and if they work hard enough they can get good grades.

But the problem is if a student want to take those classes they have to ask for a permission from their parents first, because a lot of students want to take the class but their parents theyre dont agree with their children and also sometimes to take those classes its need time and some kids dont have compassion to take it easy and they ruined it.

But i am agree with people who believe that students should required to take music,drama and art class because they can learn something new in their life and someday they can find a job to be an artistic or musician to play song in any events and drama they can get to record for the TV shows and that will be a good job for them in the future.

Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever. These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyones personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments.

On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just dont pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different. For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it. These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to.

They say that is better working with more people because when you work alone you get bored or you dont get motivated as the people that works in groups.

Also, the work can be divided in equal parts, and thats fair, in that way everybody have the same amount of work to do. Some people think otherwise, they prefer working alone for many reasons. First, it is a little bit boring because they dont have nobody to talk and to share their ideas but they know what they are going to work with. They can do their work in their own way, they can take all the time they want to do the work. Second, they do not have to wait for people to tell them what to do or to ask if the work that they did is correct.

The first impression of a person about you could change over time just like your first impression about someone youve never met before could change as time passes and yall get know each other and hang out, go out to eat just like in a relationship, when the girl meets the guy and he looks so handsome, respectful, polite, nice, generous, very responsible from her point of view, when his at school, work, even when his home or even to the point of calling him sexy even if he is the skinniest guy ever you would tell him ""Wow baby, youre so sexy"", even if his not you would say it because you wouldnt want him to feel bad or anything to ruin that bond but when you guys start talking even more, start to hangout more often that bond will start to grow stronger in confidence and trust so when that time hits, It gives us a whole 360 degree spin now you start to be more open with your partner and you actually start saying the real things, Im not saying you have to lie but people in specific try to cover their lies with other lies and some times it dont even work or it dont add up at all but what Im saying is that when that right time actually hits you start being more open and youre not afraid and for the same the reason, you guys develop your ways up and work it out to the point of building a really strong trust, that confidence in you guys eyes, that key to your heart and let everything be free. It will take a while for you to see the prove but probably not to long but the results will come at one point and dont doubt it. however, with your first impressions you will represent yourself to the people or the way you act or the way you act in the beginning it will make them know if your child dish, immature, or the opposite. If you put that respect and honesty in the beginning people will treat you with respect but if you like to mess with people yell at them without respect dont expect something else because it will come back to you and theres this verse in the Bible that I like that says "" what you plant, thats what will grow"" I dont think i wordily got it right how i said so what its meaning is if youre a lair dont be mad or dont ask God why is he doing this to you because thats what you planted in the beginning.

You get more things done, you will not be considered lazy and you get to learn new things. When you are always doing something you get more things done and out of the way. You will not be behind on anything. This is a good habit to have because it can affect you in the long run. For example, when you get older and have to pay taxes or bills. You will be caught up and on time which is really good for your credit score. You will not be considered lazy. Many people in your life will notice how you like to get things done. This habit will definitely get you a job. No employer is looking for someone lazy and does not like to do things. Keeping yourself busy can be therapeutic. Many people do this to relive stress or think about things instead of being useless. You will learn new things. Take advantage of the things you do because it can lead you to new opportunities. You can experience different things which is phenomenal. It is always fun keeping yourself busy because you feel great after the things you have accomplished. The more things you learn the more things you can try to keep yourself busy.

Thats the meaning of this statement and Ill explain you why I am agrre with this powerful phrase. I believe that immigrants who came to United States are the strongest people because they have to do a lot of sacrificies before to come here, for example, some parents live theirs children with their grandparents or take the risk to come with them even knowing how hard is the way to come to America. Its really difficult to come to a new country without know the lenguage, the city, and what kind of peolpe will you find in the way, some are good persons who helps them some of them are racist, they start from cero without a hosue, a car, a good job, being alone and so far from their families, this is how they get the strength to keep moving up and help their families in their countries. They are the best example for this statement to teach us how can we start from down in a new place and get the opportunity to be in the top without never give up making clear our goals and purposes, sometimes we want to do something that we really love but we feel afraid to fail, but if we never try we never going to know how it feels like to see ours dreams realized. If you believe in what you think , then it worths and do not let anyone tell you that you can not. Im agree with this statement because it shows us a different way to see what we call difficult or imposible to make. When the things are getting hard just think in the price that you will earn at the end or how proud you will be for made that thing that you wanted to do and someone told you that you could not make. Just be as an immigrant, brave, able, capable to risk all that they have to get a new opportunity, a different way of live but always thinking about the yearned price.

Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers. Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it. Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young peoples lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they dont know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they dont listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew. In conclusion, the importances of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble. Some people says that curfew is a force on young peoples lives.

In the other hand other people think that inactivity also serve a purpose like we can live our life no matter if we do something, or not like if we dont work hard for our goals its fine, and some people say that what happen in your life is for a reason or like is your destiny. but i think that they are wrong because we can decide what we going to be in our life, thats why God left us the free will to have the opportunity to choose what we going to fight for, and make a decision that going to help us to accomplish whatever we want in this life. In conclusion I believe that we can accomplish many awesome and great things if we work hard for our goals and maintain our mind doing something good and something that we love like in our jobs, our school, our career etc. also if we maintain our mind occupied in something productive at the same we win something because its help our life and also we have to be careful to dont get distracted for others bad things like drugs, alcohol etc. I believe we have to take care to our life like a treasure because this life is what God give us and we have to be careful the decision we take and if we get wrong we can learn from our mistake, and I think is wonderful how much may be done if we are doing something that we like.

659,3029,9C76CF46D791,"Students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. When students enter high school, they begin to work at a specific job to earn some money in order to be prepared for their future career. It is not a good idea for students to commit to a specific career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work, students are still getting education, and specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because it will cause distractions from school work. In high school, teachers and other faculties take education seriously and gets harder for students every year as they develop. Students get a lot of homework and tests they have to study for and need to focus on education in order to graduate from high school and get to a good collage. Spending time on a specific job before their actual career can distract students and decrease their grades. For example, a high school student goes to work at a salon after school but they have so much homework and a test to be prepared for, but they have dont have enough time to study and accomplish their homeworks since their specific job is in the way. So they begin to get a low grade and fail tests, which can also give them a low self-esteem. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because are still getting education. High school students are still young and are still developing, they need to spend their high school years to study and get a good education in order to develop. In their high school years, students begin to get an idea of what they wish to be for their future career, so they are still learning about it and thats how they get a better amount of money, be well-educated, and live a good and healthy life. For example, high school student is not well-educated and is still developing, so they need to keep studying and learning in school to graduate and get to a good collage to study about their future career that interests them and the dream job they are wishing to work for. A specific career will take them away from their dream job. Students should not commit to a career at a young age because specific jobs will distract students from activities they enjoy. It is important for students to do activites they enjoy to be healthy and have something positive and enjoyable to do. When they get a specific job during their high school years, it will take them away from these enjoyable and positive activities they and will have no time to do it when they have a specific career and school, which can also cause stress for students and will never find anything positive that they enjoy to do. For example, a student plays football and really enjoys it and it gives them positive energy. But they have to go to school and need time to do their schoolwork and study to pass. When they get a specific job, they dont have time to do their favorite activity and also not have enough amount of time to study and do schoolwork, which can cause stress to students. In conclusion, students should focus on studying and education in high school and not get a specific career that will distract themselves from school or any activities they enjoy to just to get money. They have to keep developing and study hard to get to a good collage and be prepared for their dream job to get a good amount of money and live a better life.",9,7,7,8,10,8,2083,"conventions 8, grammar 10, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody. As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow.""

I think its a good idea to change the price of the menu, because some students do not have money for buy lunch, and some people dont eat because dont have money, more when the cafeteria has a good menu. In my opinion its a good idea to know what menu has every day in the cafeteria, all the student want to know what is the menu every day.

Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives? A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption. If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives? The city councils debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives?

No one want to live their life with the negative way that not good for everyone, their family, and everyone around them. Let thinking about that when you have positive attitude and good energy and give it to everyone first thing you got is people will love you because that make people feel comfortable when near by, they feel your positive energy you giving to them,and you will have a good friendship when you give them the best feeling they need after all the problem, stress in their life. The second thing is that make yourself happy, life is tired you will not happy if always have a negative attitude in life, no one can make you happy except yourself. The last one is some people think they are having very bad life, they always get the worse thing than other people, and they want to give up but if they looking around them they are not the one have the baddest life. Follow that way you will never become success. When you do a good thing make everyone happy and you will feel like you are so cool, you are very good, anyway you will feel happy because you was did a good thing and when they happy they will give their love, their respect. They like you and when you get in trouble they will help try their best to help you without your money like the way you make them happy. Or the long time no see they still remember you in the good memory, and not forget you make feel you important in the world everyone not forget you, that is the success in life. I am very sure most of us learn from teachers and parents are always the positive way and positive attitude, they will not teach you some thing bad and negative, what is mean? That mean they want you to live the most happy you can because they know they cant go with you or following you forever. The success not mean you become you must be rich or must become famous, you can think it the easy way is make yourself happy. For example, when you rich but you not live positive attitude and people not respect you, love you, support you, or you always worry about your money, you get stress or some people always say they love you but for real they just love your money when become poor they will leave, I am sure you still not happy for that way. People think they have very bad life and always think the worse thing that the negative attitude and it will go with you forever and you never have the better life, the life you want and you never become successful. Why people always say never give up or you dont know how far you can touch your dream, you think it very far away, some it next to you but you just dont take your chance and your time to finish your dream. For example you think you dont know or not good at anything, why you dont try it? whatever you are you still not doing great for the first time just do your best, you can do better for the next time, you will never know what you can until you try it, you believe you could and you did it. When you touch your dream by hard-working, and you will know the challenge in the life make you grow up. in conclusion, the success in life is can be base on the attitude you have, the positive is always good thing for your life, that make you life is easier dont make you life become too hard. The first of all you need make yourself happy, then you can make other people happy, finally dont give up make your life going up by your hard-working if you can do all of those thing you are successful not by your career or your money but by your good energy and positive attitude make it become success.

For some students this is a big privilege. Find out who they are. A few of this students are not really insterested in this opportunities. They tend to think that is useless just because they dont have the program they are insterested in. Normally people get use to the things they like, and they dont want to learn new things. Sometimes is hard to see that learning about new things could give huge benefits. Other students realize that it could be fun to learn about new things. If they are lucky enough they could find the career they like. When kids start to go to school teachers always ask them to think about what they want to be when they grow up. Almost everyone wants to be a policeman, a fireman, a teacher, or a doctor. When they grow up their way of thinking chances. Kids realize that there are a lot of other things that they could like. While others grow with the same mentality. Some of them make it happen, but some others change their mind in the way. It does not only happens when they are little. It could happen when they grow up, so they should give it a try to new things. It might be better than it looks. Also, If they find the program they like and try it out they might find out if they truly like it. I had a friend, and he really loved psychology.

Although it was too late to back up he realized that psychology was not what he was looking for. Sometimes people believe they have what they want and that there is nothing that could stop it.

Some others see that there are a lot of benefits in it and go for it. I classify myself as the kind of student that takes new chances. I also have two careers in mind.

Like the more you imagine about things you experience through your job, the less knowledge you have to learn about something that havent exist in the ability of inventing something creative that is very useful and better than anything.

In school a person learned skills to help a person in the further such as, wrighting, reading, vocabulary, history, and math etc. A person will learned, how to talk to other people, and how to act, by making friend.

669,2787,8C645419E1B4,Others would not appreciate kindness. First acts of kindness has an impact on others because others may not be used to being kind to everyone around our environment. Next showing kindness to other people is not something everybody does on a daily bases however that does not mean we hate each other we just dont show what kindness really looks like. Finally its not always good to be kind to others because other people like to be treated good or bad. Kind isnt always the best choice. First being kind isnt always the best choice in different situations. For example picking if a student should get bullied or choosing a friend for you to help on the test like who would a help. Next kindness can also lead you to big trouble. For example u standing up for a student who gets hurt and bullied by the bully if your school has no cameras around its easy for the bully to lie about the situation that happened with the kid who got bullied if there are no cameras in your local school. Finally about the bullying part the person who is getting bullied by the bully and the person who is standing up for the kid who gets bullied they can even get in trouble for interfering. Dont be kind to those who arent good people First students and others who are being mean to you they are probably not a good person therefore dont talk to them and shouldnt be kind to them. Also a reason to not be kind to those who arent good people is because they have the discipline to teach themselves to treat others right. Finally if you are getting annoyed by the person who is being mean to you than talk to a teacher about it and they can talk to the student about being kind to others.,6,8,7,8,8,8,1867,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 6"
670,24,2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything. My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out. My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything. My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time. Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

671,2849,89857315A1A4,"How to distribute forty work hours a week most usefully? Nowadays, a four-day work week is very rare, because this system is new; people always being careful when something new come out, but then they understand it is better. The four-day schedule is more balanced, energy and money saving and variable. This is why, I believe, our school should should follow the new schedule. First, the forty-day school week is more well-distributed, because the students would have more time for rest, doing homework; so their ability to study will have been raised. On another hand, ten hours in school might be exhausting for the pupils, but the school administration may make breaks longer and more frequent to solve the problem of tired students Second, the four-day schedule lowers the use of energy and resources. The school would use less electricity to heat and cool the building; it will spent less money for servicing the students and investigate saved money to science researches, equipment and study program development. Third, with the sour-day schedule the pupils become more free: they might share more time with their family and friends; spent more time for their hobbies and working. The students may hardly learn if they are late for making project or plan the interesting and fun weekend in the three days; the bad thing about rest four days: you will not rest. School days will be very busy, hard; but maybe more educational and efficient. Long ten hours in school might be uncomfortable for the students, who do extra curriculum activities like preparing courses, art clubs and sports. However, our school has all comfortabilities to do extra curriculum activities inside the schools building, so the students do not need to go anywhere else. To conclude, the four-day school week seems experimental for people yet; but when something new is thought the people realize an idea is innovative, then the idea becomes an action, which becomes regular.

Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, youll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle. My second idea is walking. Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now im not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us. My third and last idea is to find a job. Working with my Dad has given me a lot of money, I bought nice shoes, cloths and bought my family things too, but it wasnt just about the money. Working with my Dad really has given me another way to look at life, gave me a reason to change my ways and made me see that the real life isnt easy. And its amazing to see the building now, to see how much its improved from last time i was there and now its just like a maze to me. This is why I believe its never okay to be board, or idle. Because just imagine all the things you can get done, therefore, this is was i think Thomas Jefferson right when he said,"" it is wonderful how much you can get done if we are always doing.""

673,1931,A1BFCDA12FB1,"People should make their own decisions about lifes important matters. i agree with this statement because once people get older as a person they know what they are doing and what they want. another reason is high school, people are a teenagers and people are still learning, but sometimes make mistakes. moreover when people are eighteen they start to make important choices and actions about their life. When a person gets older they learn between right and wrong. for example a person should never spend their money on something they dont need and knowing if they do theyll be broke and have financial problems. people know what are the needs and wants in life, they learn this through out life and the one to make the decisions. High school is where people start to have an idea or know what you wanna do as a career. In high school you get to meet a lot of people and make new friends, in addition you make a lot of decisions. The decisions people make and ask their self are, should i be friends with this person, should i go to this class, and sometimes people dont wanna continue school. more over people wanna experience a party in high school so they sometimes make the decision to go and drink or do drugs, but end up getting in serious problems. In the end people make the decisions. When a person turns eighteen they are an adult now and probably out of high school. People are either in collage or working when eighteen. Thats a decision people make before graduating and thats a very important life choice. Sometimes people make the decision not to go to collage or sometimes go to collage then drop out and thats a decision a person makes because they think its the best for them. in conclusion people make decisions and learn from it. People know between right and wrong, need and wants, and what they wanna do in life. You also make mistakes in life and sometimes you need to make that mistake in order for you not to make the same decision again. At the end of the day people know what they want in life and know the decisions they make. Guidance from others is a idea or option, people will still have to make the decisions.

Sometimes you will have a lot of impressions of people,things,or animals..However some percent of humans can not change their first impressions ,because they think that ,they are sure about their impressions , and there is when your mind has to change,so you can check first to make sure that yours impressions are rights,and I will support my response putting myself like a example; One day , I was at my house doing some work out ,and then I started to having some strainghts impressions, That I had the impressions that my girlfriend was cheating ,with my best friend, so I get mad ,because that impression was to difficult to believe, also you have to be carefully, when you have a bad impressions of someone, you have to know how reaction will be. Also you have to make sure that yours impressions is right, so I called my girlfriend and we had a long conversation , but the thing is that I did not know , how tell or ask her my impression that I had with her and my best friend, however I was trying to change my impression, but my mind and my brain was confucing, because that impression can put me in problems with my girlfriend or somebody else, so the thing is that I did change my impression ,knowing that not all your impressions thyat you think are rights, some impressions that you get sometimes, its because you are not sure about something, or you no truths in that person who make you have a bad impression. My point of this statement is that the first impression its possible to change, in the way that you, always will have a good impressionas or bad impressions, so on my example is that sometimes you have to keep your impressions and just let the things happens or like passing the time you will know if your impression was right or not.

Fistly, When you talk to others, you sometimes gives a example about other people experiences. For example, someone who was a bad person in the past and now he change. You can change bad relations or yourself . You are influencing that person with reasons, examples and actions, he can change himself. If he wants. Second, always we influenced people with reasons, maybe bad reasons or good reasons but is the only way to influence others.

When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things. Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days. First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesnt like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time its going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person. there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldnt figure out where ive seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didnt we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and havent seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

For example; My brother took his master degree when he was 22 years, now he wen back to school to take his master degree again .He regret what he already took his master degree in the past and come back to take it again it didt help him it all. another example my friend decided open his old store after the government shut it down. he open store and the government came and shut it down again.

Although technology might be taking hundreds of jobs, technology is one of the best things we have in this world. Ford industry is a great example they make their cars using robotic technology! by using these big instruments they are able to make a car every ten minutes, thats incredible, and not just that they have the capacity to sell trucks without specking to a customer, representative its all online no need of customer service. Having to buy parts has never been easier thanks to Ford/store. org get the piece you need the next day. Near my local ford dealer they have a great restaurant where technology is all they utilize. Who wouldve known by using technology in restaurants everything would run much smoother, by using technology ordering your favorite meal off a tablet was never this cool. Yes that means there would only be a few people employed and less contact with waiters/staff members but there is a good side, no need to worry about tip, especially no human mistakes, order everything off your finger tips. while your enjoying your meal staff members will have a chance to be doing somethings else unless called by a customer. Have you seen how long it takes to check out in Walmart! thanks to technology now and days?

A student has more benefits if they attend to classes in schools because if the student can not understand a topic or has questions about it, the teacher can not explain by video conferencing as a teacher that can explain face to face an be sure that student understood. My second reason is a student does not have a person who trust or a person to appeal if He/She are passing for any personal or familiar problem. In schools We can find a lot of person as a teachers, counselor, police members, and psychologist to help students. My last reason is a student has to socialize with other students to be prepare for his/her future. Firstly, if a student can not understand a topic and has questions about it, they can feel more comfortable to ask and said ""I do not understand, can You explain me again?, if they are with the teacher face to face. Generic_Name (My friends name) decided to take the classes online, in the beginning He was so excited, but after one month He told me that was not a good choice because He does not feel comfortable asking a lot of question about one topic by the computer, and when He not understood something, He just do not said anything to the tacher who is given him classes by video conferencing. Secondly, in schools we can find many ways to be help if we have any problem in home. Teachers, counselors, any person who works in the school can help us. In my junior year I had a classmate who was attending to the school but then she change her classes to online, When I ask her why she change her classes She told me that her mom was fired of her job and She had to start working to support her family. She was 16 when that happened she felt alone with nobody who help her. Lastly, students has to socialize with other students to feel the sensation of surpassing. If they just does not want to attend school because they are shy or they does not like to interact with other students, We are not educating a good citizen. Students has to feel the sensation of surpassing when they do their homework or when He/She finished their assignments, that sensation the student can not lose. I read in a newspaper a case about Generic_Name, He was 16 when He attended to online classes, He never like attend to school when He discover the option for students to attend classes from home he decided take it. because He never like to interact with other students. After 2 years he graduated, but he never were prepare to socialized with persons, and that affects his personal life.

I do not agree with the schools that offer distance learning, because it could be difficult for students to understand the online notes or videos, the students always need a teacher to ask questions, and the students parents need to pay internet at home. Also the internet is expensive and some parents can not afford. First, it can be beneficial for the students to attend at school because there is more activities and sports, where they can have fun with their friends. Also, the teachers are always there to help and explain better the subjects. From my own experience, I need to be with a teacher to understand what is the topic about, that helps me to pass my exams and my classes. Even thought, there is some teachers that are very strict and irritate the students but the teachers know that is beneficial for the students future. Therefore, being at home the whole time it is so boring because the students need to be studding and not having fun. That is why some students cannot develop them knowledge because they do not take fresh air and entertain them minds with someone else. For example, my friend Generic_Name she is at the Community College and the teachers offer some online classes and she decided to take it. But now she is frustrating because she have to watch some boring videos and she have to take quizzes constantly. She told me that she miss all her friends and her classmates. After all, certain student do not have their mind clear enough attending to school; now imagine how difficult would be for them to take online classes without a teacher. For example, Generic_Name was taking online courses because he got sick so he could not attend to school for one year. Then, he came back to school, he was so disappointed because he mist a lot of stuff from his subject. He had to stayed after school and he had to go to summer school. Well, so far I have not take online classes but I take my friends experiences that is not easy. Finally, in my opinion is not a great idea that the students take online classes, if they want to move faster and achieve in the future. Some teachers think that online classes is easier for the students, then attending to school because the students take them own time to study. But the consequences is when the students fail their subject and they had to take it again in school. ""The more the students attend to school. The smarter they grown.""

Another reason is that the students can save a lot of time working online at home, because they dont need wait for the bus, or walk directly at the school. For example, if you work at home, you dont need permission to use the bathroom, because youre at home, so you can use the bathroom anytime. Another example is that some times work in the school can be so noisily, also can be uncomfortable, but if you prefer to work online you get not problems because you can be more focus in your work, and also you can feel more comfortable working online.

I do not have experience at all but, I can show you that I am a good candidate for this job and I could handle the job very well. Here are some few reason why I would be a good candidate for the job. One reason on why you should hire me is that even though I dont have experience I tend to learn really fast and do multiple things at a time. Usually I memorize them very easily. It has a greater impact on me because I learn fast and customers are more happy with the service. Also, I could do many things at a time which is good for the job and good for the customers. For example, in some restaurants it takes long for someone to do your order or even get to your table to get your order. It is better if you have someone that is fast and shows that the customers are there number one priority. It is good that the customers feel welcomed and feel important when the workers are giving them attention. Another reason is that I have an amazing, outstanding attitude with people. I am a very joyful person and what I feel like is right, is giving joyfulness to customers who need it. For example, I have friends that sometimes have had a rough day and I tend to help them and make them happier and change their perspective to a better one. I think it is good that if a restaurant has someone happy and joyful the customers would want to come in because its a very joyful place. My goal is always to see poeple smiling and keept encouraging them to always be happy. The restaurant can always make more money when customers feel like its there home. Lastly, I like meeting new people at jobs and working as a group. What I love to do is bringing everyone together and making new friendships. Ive seen that when working as a groups it is better because you get things done faster. You also make greter connections with your coworkers. For example, If someone needs something for a customer and your busy doing something else its better to ask a coworker to help you out. I like bringing bonds together and working with them. These are some of the reason I would love to get the job. I want to learn something new thats not from my perspective. I love trying new things and getting to know the different types of jobs around the community. I also learn very fast and I love being commited to anything and working as a group.

690,651,863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldnt be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they dont let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law. Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. Thats why parents would feel like its a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids dont even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldnt feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didnt have parents. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and theyll have to face their actions. If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think its not important to learn like if it isnt important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults. Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they dont. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldnt be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they dont listen after theyve been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful. In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",7,7,8,8,9,8,1775,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
691,455,42F8715D04A3,"What would be your lesson to elementary students be? If I was asked to share a lesson to elementary it would be not to cheat. That lesson is important because the students could get into big trouble, show what they dont know, and loose their teachers trust. First, If a student does cheat they could get in big trouble. One, they could get a zero on the test, and a zero on a test will lower the students grade. Second, the student could get sent to the principals office and could get a call home. The students parents will also be upset. They would be in trouble at home and at school. Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesnt know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesnt know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade. Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated. Those are the three good reasons why my lesson to the elementary students is important.",8,8,6,7,8,7,873,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
692,1706,D3C9A3C2BB08,"Does technology have a negative effect on people lives? People believe that technology these days is a big part of society and that its effecting people lives in a negative way. They say it makes people feel lazy and depend on it so much and without they feel like they cant get nothing done. Although, technology has a negative effects on people lives, I believe that its positive effects is greater for few reasons. First reason, it allows people to do much more in less time. We can complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, shop, and learn without having to go no where or speaking to another person. Not only that it saves us time it also saves lives. Another reason, it helps us and others on emergency situations. For example, we are able to make emergency calls at any given time for help without having to go no where. Also, we can call to report someone or something that will harm us and others. Not only we can call for emergency we can also call people we care about that we cant reach. Final reason, We are able to talk to people we care about and love that we cant reach. For example, If your parents or someone you care about are in a different state or country, and you want to check in on them you can just call them without having to go or travel to them. This what makes technology a positive effect on our lives because it makes everything easy. In conclusion, technology has a positive effect on people lives because we can save time, save lives, and contact people we care about. This why technology has a positive effect on our lives. But at the end of the day it all depends on you and how you want to use it you can make it positive or negative to your life.

These are the reason why I would love to go to Korea beacuse of there food, the beautiful places, and the time I can get to myself. One reason, why I love Korea as much is beacuse of the food. The food in Korea is so tasty for example the korean BBQ (Barbeque). Korean BBQS is where everyone sits down at a table order some raw meat, they also get some side dishes like to go with it. Once they get the raw meat they cook it have ever they want, in the small grill in the mibble of the table. Kimchi is another type of food that I like beacuse its spicy and I love spicy foods. But the best part adout the food in Korea is the street food beacuse its so cheap but yet so tasty that I could die for it. Another reason, is the beautiful places in Korea. Visiting the Han River a great first place to go when you get to Korea. Han River has lots of beautiful pink bloosom trees which are great for taking photograghs. Generic_City is a city that is very populated with people. Generic_City is just like California here in the United State beacuse its where all the famous people live at. The best part of Generic_City is the performances beacuse you get to see so many talented people show off there skills with rapping, dancing, and singing. The beaches in Korea are a great place for families to have bonding time together, especially in Busan. Finally, the best part is ""me time"" which means I can get time for myself. Decent hotels are really hard to find but every single hotel in Korea looks amazing from the inside and from the outside. Every single thing in the hotel in is clean beacuse korean people dont like to be messy they love to be organized. The relaxition spas are great, to have some ""me time"" they do foot massages, faciaul treatment and more. Yoga is even more relaxing then anything else beacuse it helps your mind conitrait and balance its self in order to distress. These are the main things I suggest you to do if you want to realease the stress and have some ""me time"". In conlusion, I suggest you to take a trip to korea. One, is beacuse the food is great, especially the street food. Second, it have the most amazing places to visit like Han River. Last but not least, is the relaxation time i can get for myself. Well its time for me to catch a flight to korea. I hope i see you there too.

694,3761,78C22313F58E,"Generic_Name ONLINE CLASSES ARE BETTER THAN GOIING TO SCHOOL. Talking online classes are way easier and better then attending/going to school. Some schools offer distance leaning as an option for student to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. If students get this opportunity to take their classes online, I think it will be a good idea and they will benefit from being able to attend classes from home, Because Many students cant be at for many reasons,they can be sick or injured. Two, online classes help to students to take class at anytime they want . Three, online classes save students more time and money. Many students cant be at school for many reasons, for example the student can be sick or injured. So the student getting the opportunity for taking or getting his/her work done on online classes will make it easier for the student, instead of students going to school when theyre sick or Injured. So a sick student can stay at home and get his/her work done so they wouldnt be to spread the sickness or the disease around the school. And it can prevent people from getting sick too. Online classes are easier because, students can take the class at anytime they want and do what every they want do after the class. For example Students get a job and make some money to pay for school fees and bills and also they can support their family with the money. And they can take the class after work or before work on online. Also online classes makes it easier for students who have jobs and the same time going/attending school. Moreover, online classes can save students some money and time. Because driving to school everyday is a waste of gas, money and time. Students can save that money for gas and do something else with, for example they can pay bills with that money or even they can support theyre family with money. In some cases the student can have family (kids and wife) and online classes can help the student to spread more time with his/her family. In conclusion, schools offering distance leaning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. This opportunity will help students in so many ways. Students will get more time to get theyre work done on time and also save money for them self. The students can do whatever they want to after taking the class on online ( spreading time with family and having fun). THE END.......

695,536,44E2726DA1B3,"Your principal has decided all students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity. I agree because now days all kids do is stay home and be on there phones and do nothing. I know that because I used to do the same thing before and i didnt like to do anything at all but then I started playing a sport and it help a lot but i think that. Participating in a extracurricular activity may help you by staying healthy, get you out of trouble,and get you in a good college. one example is staying healthy by playing a sport you can help prevent a lot of things like maintain a good weight, and keep you from getting sick. Keeping a good weight is good for your health because it keeps you from getting other diseases,more than 1/4 of the people in the U.S. are obese. Why not start at a young age and prevent from being sick and other things. Another thing that can help is eating healthy, we can prevent sickness to in order to do that you might want to think about trying out a new sport. Another example is getting you out of trouble you can avoid a lot of drama. I learned that social media can get you into a lot of trouble, half of the time a lot of the drama comes from social media. Maybe if you join a club or a sports team you can think before doing something that can get you in trouble. One time my friend made the soccer team but she got in trouble so they kicked her off the team and she learned from her mistake and never got in trouble again. When in your in a cub or playing a sports half of the time you dont have time to be in drama get in trouble. Last example is joining a club, working on the year book,serve in the student council and, playing a sport can get you into a good college now a days colleges are looking to see if you have participated in any sports or clubs. When i graduate high school i want to go to college and a study to be a general surgeon and participating in a sport or joining a club can help me get into a college. You meed new people when you join new clubs and make new friend ships. When you want to go into a club or in sports do something that you like not something your friends like or something that can help you in life with. In conclusion staying healthy,getting out of trouble,and going into a new college can help you when you participate in a extracurricular activity. staying healthy by playing a sports and eating healthy can prevent you from getting sick. Staying out of trouble can avoid a lot of drama from school and social media think before you do something your going to regret .

Like when you think about a subject that takes you way over that your brain wont handle itself. but mabey sometimes your knowledge can be more efficient than your imagination because your brain is acting more mature when it comes to obstacles that are difficult. your brain acts more when its come to a problem like that time you got stuck on that question on that math test youve taken. sometime even when you are reading a book. reading a book may help you vocabulary when you read. but therere time when they both help each other. both knowledge and imagination can help when you construct something. mabey you wanted to built something but you had no idea what. thats why you have you imagination comes right on in to tell you many ideas on what to build. once you think of the build you knowledge is there to help out to figure out on how you should build it. your brain get all the knowledge to help to build that dimension of the building there s how both can work together, but still therere some negative times when it come to imagination and knowledge. like that time you are felling a bit down and your imagination said that you cant find anything to make you happy. sometime when your imagination goes a bit to far like that time you play with friends when you were younger you can make thing a bit unfair with your imagination and can loose that friend. in middle school with that knowledge of yours can change many things on a test. you can do good or bad. but say you did good and you were the student that had the highest score but you friend go one of the lowest score but you bragged about it yo can also loose that friend. imagen if a 16 year old boy wanted a job. he may have not be the smartest but he has a few bad grades. either he will get a get a good job or hell stay jobless cause if how much knowledge he had since he does no study hard enough. so other students may have better knowledge and have received the job they have wanted. mabey t he 16 year old boy needed the job to pay for food but he had to ask all his friend to buy food since he had no ob nor the money. so in the future he became homeless because he had to pay the money back to the friends he had cause he needed money. young children have the most imagination since they have nothing to expect. but at night children think they see monster are on closets and want to have their mom and dad to come see it for themselves but their parents say that there are no monsters. later the night they start hearing noises but cant tell were its coming from so they scream mom dad again because the child thought there was still a monster in the room. but the parents still say that there are still no monster in the room. later on the child starts to think that there it still a monster so the child went on outside the room and notice that it was no monster it was just their parent just making noise just to scare their child just for fun.",5,6,5,5,5,5,1965,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

698,2600,8B155840CA6D,"Summer is the time for students to take a break from school, but some educators feel that summer break is too long and it needs to be shorten. As for me, I am strongly disagree with this idea because summer is the time for student to visit their famiy, their relatives, to do whatever they like, to enjoy whatever they love and sometimes learning too much might be somthing that some students could not handle. First of all, summer is the time for students to come back to their hometown to visit their family. Some students, like me, came from another country so a lot of times we do miss our hometown. That is why having a three month summer break is truly a huge chance for us because that is pretty much the only reunion we have in a year. I will take mine as an example. To be able to come back to Generic_City it is not just about time, sometimes it could involve money. The ticket is just too expensive, not to mention that it is in summer. So if I can visit my family this year, I might have to wait a few years later to be able to visit them again. Secondly, this is a period of time where students can do whatever thay want to do like doing some volunteering or club activities or playing sports or just simply doing their favorite hobbies. If we shorten the summer break, students will easily get bored when they come back to school because they do not have enough time to do what they like in summer. Nobody wants to study when they are bored. So if we want a student to return to school with lots of energy, we need to let them have a break. And that give me an example. One of my Vietnamese friend told me that even in summer he still have to take a lot of tutor classes. That is why if we shorten the summer break then lots and lots of Asian students will not even have time to do what they love! Last but not least, learning too much might be something that some students could not handle. A short summer break meaning we have to go to school more than we need. I know that if we shorten the summer break we will have a longer winter break, but that is not the case for the country that does not have a winter break or a week off in fall and spring. A student could get stress if they do not have a proper break. Just check some examples on the news or internet, especially in South Korea or Japan. A lot of students suicide just because of learning too much. Too many homeworks and tests, pressures from parents and teacher,.... Very stressful! Not to mention that Asian students usually have a shorter summer break and winter break. On the whole, I am not agree with this idea and along with fact that I am an Asian and I used to go through a very strict and tough education in Asia, I can never accept this. Students need to have some times to release their stress after a long year at school by visiting their family or doing whatever they like.",9,9,7,9,6,7,1848,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 9, vocabulary 7, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
699,494,C15EC5707409,"To conserve energy and resources, some businesses have adopted a four-day work week, with each day consisting of ten hours. Should your school follow this model by extending the school day two hours. I do not agree, with this model by extending the school day two hours. I Think my school should not follow this model by extending the school day two hours, because two more hours of school will be very streful for students and students will not have the enought time to do their homeworks after school. On the other hand this would be a big problem for schools. In first place, I think this will be a big disadvantage for studets who have others responsiblity to do after school. For example, I have a job after school and I need to be there at four oclock, but if my school follow this model I wouldnt keep my job, because school will finish two ahours late and it will be very late for me to go to work. This show, that if school follow this model this really will affect me and not only me- but also other students who, also have to work after school. Second, two more ahurs of school will be very streful for students, because classes will be longers than what they usually are, so students will get tired and they will not concentrate in what the teacher is saying. Also students will not have the enought time to do their homework after school, becuase they will get very late and tired at home and they will not feel like to do their homework, knowing that they need to rest for the next day of school. With this in mind, students, also will be affecting with their grades, for the reason that they will not turn in their homeworks. Some say, if schools follow this model by extending the school day two hours, would be a big problem for students attendance because students will not show up to every single day of school, for the reason that they will be tired from the day before of school. Therefore follow this model would not be a good idea to deal with, because attendance is something very important that schools require to students can pass their school year. In the final analysis, this rutine will not be easy for students to face, even know that there is going to be only for day of school, for me this still not a good idea to agree with. As a student that I am this would affect me in my daily rutine. Students will be very streful and tired during class. This would affect the students attendence which, also will affect their grades.

I disagree with that because, many students have other activities after school. It could also affect the teachers by them staying after longer and kids would just have to take in a lot of new material including homework and its not healthy for them. I feel like when they add extra school hours to the day it would mess the students schedule up, they could have sports after school or tutoring. They could really enjoy their activities and for them not to be able to do any of that anymore does not seem fair.""I have soccer practice every day after school and I love it and it would be a shame if i had to give it up because of more school.""The parents would also have to change their schedule because they could be at work and then have to leave to pick up their children, they would also not have as much time hanging out with friends or family because school would be their main focus when they could be outside being kids. However students enjoy seeing their friends at school and saying ""hello or hi"" we need more time to communicate as well so our friendships dont fade. Teachers as well would have to work longer shifts, and they already stay after grading students papers while they also have to find out what the next lesson is going to be the next day. They take time out of their day to help the students who are falling behind in the subject and need a little more help to make sure they succeed in school and in their future. Teachers also have families just like every other person in the world, which means they should be able to go home at a good time and help their children out with their work or be able to cook dinner and take time out to care for their kids. Teachers need breaks as well they work very hard to maintain the material we need to understand. They leave the school late like 5-6 and when they leave they look exhausted just imagine them leaving at 7-8 including the fact that they sometimes would stay after helping students and that makes the student tired. We need to give teachers some credit and not push the limits for them as well. Students stay at school for eight hours each day and if you extend it to nine and a half hours that does not seem like a good amount for students. If they get a lot of work on top of their homework that could stress them out, and because of that their grades could go down because of to much work. We only get three months from school and some shorts breaks and then we have nine months of school, and then you add another hour then what is the point of a break when you just make the school days longer. Kids love going outside and doing there hobbies they cant just sit in a chair all day that also just makes them more irritated. Students also have tests and quizzes including homework each week. If you add more hours kids are probably going to fall asleep and not pay attention which would lead to not participating, students would not have a good attitude either because they would be grumpy and upset that the school day is longer. Our brain can only take so much and they would over due it which is not good for our health. We sleep 9-12 hours a day and have another eight hours at school and then we come home and do more school work and study which leads us pretty much with two hours of they day for us to eat and get ready for bed, just so we can do it over again the next day. As a student I feel like that would be to much. We are people not robots we need to live not be stuck in a building all day long. We have family and friends that we want to spend time with and that wont be able to happen if they change it because,"" they think we need longer days.""

Fight for what you desire in life, dont let anyone get in negativity go through your head just turn it to them something postive or take that negativity and use as motivation to make you work harder in life to show them what you can do by yourself. Life is everything you have one live to live to fullest your parents has brought you into this world becasue he knows you have something speical hidden you that can maybe change the world . I believe everyone can achieve there by just following there heart and mind with no one interfering what you like to do for a living, but if you get lost or need help along your path to success ask someone that is very close to you that you know who has back no matter what that understand you that aint trying to ruin your life should always choose people wisely.

Most of the student have reason that is to much break during summer break, but I am disagree with the idea of change the schedule of vacaction time. Could be during summer break the student forget some information of school, but all student wait for summer because much student like to travel to their country during vacation time, or some student only can see their family during summer break and their like to pass time with them, I guess is better time to take vacation in summer. Also the eductors need to think about the thing they can do during summer break because during winter the weather is really bad and also is too much snow and is too cool for to go out side. Another reason that why is bad idea to get break during winter is because in winter the job is slow, and the center recreational are close like the pool, beach, park, and the fair. I think 3-4 week break during summer is a little be of time to have fun with the family, and enjoy their vacation I dont see the main point of the change because if they change the longer break for winter it take the same time because they also want that student take a week break durin spring and falls; Is more complicated if they change the schedule. Therefore is a bad idea to change because it should be the same way it doesnt matter what time or what station is the break it should be the same way, because if they do in winter they going to forget information, eather is not good idea because the student cant enjoy their break for the weather. In conclution I am desagree with the idea and is better during summer break, because could be the same time that the student loose.

706,2684,0316F6288791,"The new generation of students decide to take their classes in online. Although if the students take classes in online they might allow to finish high school in a short time,also they might be safe at home, they can take more free time to work or enjoy with their family, and graduate as soon as possible and start the college. Even thought some people might say students shouldnt take classes in online because they can not learn good enough, they might be distracted or even ask any question to solve their problem, regular high school have different program to help students to be successful on their grades. In this case students need to talk with any consular or teacher in school to give some advantage and disadvantage about online class, student might need to know their benefits on what they going to do for their own good. Most people care about education, students need put some interest. concluding with this state argument student should take any classes in online because they dont put much interest to learn any assignment, students might need to attendance to a regular high school to learn and have better apprenticeship, and abilities for their accomplishment, students in high school are more successful, they have good opportunities to get in the best colleges. Nowadays teenagers are more focus in having fun, some of them do not know that education is very important, if we want to have a good job and better future, every child need education first, but students are following good rulers. according to this argument I have this experience my brother want to take his classes in online because he does not want to come to the school, i still in a normal high school almost at the end of the first quarter and my brother still waiting a call for his classes. He said it was his best choice but in my opinion that was not a good idea because if come to the school i learn and understand my classes, when a teacher is explaining and helping me to do my problem i feel more exciting about it. I want to be a great student and learn everything instead of be at home waiting for an acceptation for classes. concluding with my argument students would not benefit to attend classes in online, attending to the school is more important and benefit, they take serious their resposabilities in everything,they became more measure,classes in online never going to be same as the regular school, students never are going to learn very well, teeneger really need to attendance the school for a better education.

709,3603,4E13812BC1ED,"Meet new people and make new friends is fun. Having social relationships; is a good way to have a good community. Always, when we see new people that we are about to meet, we have first impressions- ideas, feelings or opinions about a person based on the superficial. For some people, first impressions are almost impossible to change. However, I disagree with this statement, because this can change by: introducing each other, know more about favorite things, and ask questions about their life, then our first impressions will change. When a person is about to meet another person, they act differently as they are in their daily life, which is totally fine, because they are going to introduce each other and it will change. One day, when I was in my freshman year, I was really nervous and exciting at the same time, and this because I did not know anyone at the school, but I meet one girl; she was really kind and friendly. So, we introduce each other, and my first impression before introduce each other was, that she was serious and shy. The importance of this, is that our first impression can change after introducing each other, because we can have an idea of how the person is, based on their look or way to act, but this idea can be totally different after cross a few words each other. Furthermore, a good way to change our impression is knowing more about the other person, know about their favorite things such as hobbies, sports, and others; putting this in practice it can change the way of thinking of both persons. In my way of thinking about the impressions, these can be bad or good impressions, and a personality is part of the impression because it shows the behavior of a people. So, it is important to know more about the person; about their personality and by this could have a clue about the personality of the person. Finally, different person has a something important in their life, and that is what makes special to a person. For example, all my friends before they know me, they think that I look shy, calm and serious before they know me, but time later these impressions change for them. They told me now ""when we saw you for the first time, we though that you was so quite and serious"". And they said this, because they know more about me and about my life now, and they think that I am a fun friend and happy, so this is what makes me special, that I always look serious, but when the people know me, they think that I am friendly and happy. And I think that always, when we see a person that we never seem before, we should think to ask about their life, because details about their life can help us to change our way of view and think about the person. Therefore, first impressions can change, they are not always accurate in the way of how the behavior of the people can be. We could think that people are as the way of their physical appearance, but that is completely wrong. In order to meet new people, we have to introduce each other, know more about them, and ask questions about their life, then we can have a clearly personality about the person. After this, our impressions would change to a positive or negative impressions. We should not trust in our first impressions about a person, we should meet the person and our first impressions will change.

If a person being themselves then they just want to do anything they know and do not care another person. However, they live in the modern world and have many things to worries. Although people have their own decision, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment because sometime they need to change and over time people have done the tasks they hate. First of all, people have their own decision. So, we know that many people are accomplishment by their own decision but only for who are smart or brave challenge themselves. Some of them just live and do anything they like when they success. However, not being themselves should not change the physical world. For example, a man who has a dream that he can travel around the world. He always thinking about it but he can not. Because he know it is a modern world and has many things to do and worries. So, he put his dream on the side and focuses on the job. He hopes it will make his life better and can complete his dream later. Also, sometime they need to change. Some people they never change their life, and they just live by the rules. Of course, they will feel boring and nonsense. They want to do with something else. For instance, a person who live with his family and he recognizes that he likes to become the doctor in the future because his family want it. Absolutely, he knows what he wants to do. But when he do this job for the long times and he feels that he does not has more interest. Everyday, he is so busy and he does not has times for his family and himself. So, he knows work to lives, not lives to work. After thinking about that, he wants to do the jobs that makes him comfortable and can enjoy the wonderful life. In addition, over time people have done the tasks they hate. Task is the mission from the boss give them to completing. So, they force to finish it while they do not like. When they go out to work they need to follow all the rules of the life. Also, they can not do anything they like while living with their family before. For example, a trainee person who is young and do not have an experience in the job. Because he just graduation and he wants to become the employer in this company. So, he will manage by the marketing manager and he so happy about that. For the first day, the manager just wants him to do some work likes buy the coffee, copy papers... And he thinks it will better for the next day but the manager just gives him these jobs and no more. So, he hates it but he never give up because it is the rules of life. He recognizes that help him too much to create more skills and learn more experiences. Thus, people should not being themselves are great accomplishment. So, people should not being themselves because they do not know exactly about themselves. Some people want to become another one to success. When they look at another people they can learn more lessons and experiences in life. Sometimes, they need to change to know the outside of the world have more fun than if they just stay at one place.

Giving students the choice to attend classes online is a big responsibility; Causing the demand that they must follow instructions,and complete class work tasks. It is true that most students have no problem with this , they complete their agenda and assignments; Thus why they are more comfortable with this method of learning. But this method of learning is not always the case for some students, because it gives this students an opportunity to become nonchalant about their classes; Consequently, they start to fool around and get distracted at times. Attitudes like this can lead to: not meeting up with deadlines, missing daily classworks, poor understanding skills, and ultimately failure. Students that have poor learning skills would be incompetant to take online classes, Which mean at all costs their must be guidance for this kind of students. It is possible that due to a lack of connection with the Teacher in the classroom and the student, it is most likely they would not have the chance to ask further questions or recieve reliable advices from a teacher. In some cases students can benefit from seeking assurance from other students with more knowlegde about the subject, group activites ,and asistance. In conclusion, distance learning and its method of teaching is not helpful to every student, because a stystem of learning that benefits all students,and give students opportunity for futher understanding is more beneficial.",6,4,7,6,6,5,3436,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

However not everyone would agree with this position, because it benefits of working alone is most students dont have to wait on others to do their work. For example The teacher assignes a project and they have to be in groups of five and two of the students do their work and the other three dont do their work. It brings everyone else down. Working alone makes students not have to worry about others not doing their part of the work. Most students get to use different ideas when they work on groups. For example students get together to start talking about how they are going work together and start giving differents ideas on how to work better as a group Working in a group makes students jobs less complicated and stressful by having others helping each other Working in groups students get to help each other out. For example each student gets to be in charge of one part of the assignment so everyone contributes and work gets done faster. Helping each other out is really important to the group and communication is key when students work in groups. Communication with each student in the group is really important if students working in groups want to get work done. For example each member of the group comminicates with each other and work gets done faster. Communication helps in different ways,helping someone if they dont understand something,Giving advice to another student if they feel like they are stuck or need a different opinnion or not agreeing with someone else theres always a different way to communicate that to each other. communication is key to work in groups. Working in groups benefits one another by working faster, communicating with each other, helping each other out when someone is not understanding something and giving different ideas. Working in groups can be helpfull if students know how to use it and take advantage of the opportunnity. It should be the best way to get work done and be able to help each other out.

This connection is established from the joy of physicle and fitness related activities that health/P.E can assure. I find this activitie mostly enjoyable since it has some of the sports I play in after hours outside of school grounds,which builds a strong connection. I also enjoy the connection i make with others such as the other students and the teacher since health/P.E are mostly social based activities, were teamwork and cooperation are needed. This is an art in which others and you could interact with each other which if to the right exstent can bring joy to those who socialize in educational manners, but with that also brings educational activities which is much more of important when it comes to P.E because education always comes first when it comes to any class in the education atmosphere. P.E may bring a positive inpact on others who need social activites to interact with others,which is what makes P.E enjoyable and impactful for me and much others.

Working in team also prepares students for future careers and job. Whoever they will be required to learn to cope with other people and personalities, it is valued by employers. Even though students are not agree with each other all the time, working together is ore beneficial than working alone. Every body ha heard someone in their life say "" two minds are better than one"" before right, this quote has never range more, and all of the idea it promotes reflect crystal clear off of group work. Working in a group can be drastically reduce the amount of work you need to do as well as make thing of more efferent, whether it be a group project paperer presentation. Because it cuts down on how much work one person has to do. It allows for group to achieve more as alone. Things are also finished much quicker because of the way many people can split up different jobs in a group an people with different skill sets can do what they are best at and do not have to worry about what they are bad at, this broader range of skill can also be used to help other people members develop their own by learning from their team members. The diversity found within a group of people is one of most powerful resources a person can have when it comes to finishing a task. it lends a group of people to have many more ideas to come up with and bounce off of because many people are working ""The best way to have good idea is to have a lot of the a quote from Linus Pauting dealing with dilemma new ideas. When dealing with abdicating an idea from thin air, it be best to have multiple people instant of one because it brings multiple ideas all have fair and different point rather than multiple ideas no opposition or diversity. Another benefit of having multiple people working in one group is that this can cause an evolutionary like phenomenon with multiple, stronger idea that complete and mulute, creating one in tribute and exceptional idea. This also comes with the help of a group, as a group can decide which idea would be main idea and smoothe out the edyes. Another problem that can come up is well problem. Having a group of people can become extremely helpful for solving a problem that may come up in situations where a problem can arise, having a group of people can allow for quick and easy way to get out of a situation. Now working in a group does not have its advantage but some things are best done alone Though working in a group can seem to be good working alone can be better depending on the situation. Being in group full of adult and unfocused group members is infuriating and may seem like torture. Although, some people prefer working alone because they can focus better and make decision faster, in the end, it is a better to working in a group. if one does not do work the only they fail. Also being in a group fell safe. While being alone means you are much more impotent so working in group Though working alone can be better for one reason such as anxiety. paranoia worry about other preference, or simply because they would prefer to work alone. Working in a team is advantage over some others who are unaccustomed to doing so , it helps develop people skill decision making skills and general expertise for putting up with others. working in a group is also good for getting other peoples opinion on group member work, as long as they do their part, oftentimes students will learn and experience more in a group of their peers than working alone which is definitely better for their future an possibly what lies ahead. Developing these skill will most likely help in the coming times of college, careers their future family and even retirement. Overall, working together is beneficial because it creates less work and allow work to be completed faster. Working together promotes constructive criticism from other member of the group , which produces a better final product, working together create different points of view with different points of view new ideas are generated.

739,2576,7A552DBA7D71,"The effects of allowing students to have and use cellphones in the classroom is not listening to what the teacher has to say, not using it property for your educational purposes, and disturbing the class from learning. The students with not pay attention to what the teacher, because they are so busy in their cellphones. Some students decide not to use it for educational purposes and uses it for other purposes. Using cellphones in class will also disturb other from learning, because they are so in to their cellphone. These are the reasons how using cellphones in class can effect them from learning. First, you will not be able to learn if you are using your cellphone in the class. Using your cellphone in class may get you off task and u would not know what u learn today in class. Some days u would be mad and take it out on other, because of what you heard on your cellphone. Overtime your cellphone vibrate you always going to want to see what it is and that will have your attention. You will not be able to focus like you use to with our education and be on your cellphone at the same time. Second, using your cellphone for other purposes can not help you learn what you need to learn. If you do not use your cellphone for educational purposes you would not know noting from school to know about. You can get in some problem for not using it for education. They should not have it out unless the teacher say you can for your assignment. This is why people should not use cellphones in school for these purposes. Thirdly, people will disturb other people from trying to learn with there devices that can cause a disruption. The cellphones will ring and stop everyone from learning, because they will pay attention on whose phone is ringing. You will not be able to know how to do the work if do not know what to do. you are disturbing your classmates that are trying to learn the material they need so they can do something with there lives. You should not disturb your classmates from being successful in life. As you can see, the effect of having a cellphone in class while you are trying to learn to be successful. You should not be ignoring what your teacher has to has to you and your classmates. The use of the cellular device can only be use for education and not other purposes. Last but not least, do not make your classmates fell just because you do not want to successful does not mean your classmates do.

740,135,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you dont study yourself at something you failed at, then you cant become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that wont happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice. Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didnt feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then dont worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and cant move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past. Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you wont reach to the top to become successful. For example, you cant swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont wont to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up. In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better.

741,1644,5CAA840DD4C6,"AFTER SCHOOL HOMEWORK CLUB Generic_Name INTRODUCTION: Havent you ever thought of starting an after school homework club for students who are having difficulty in certain subjects?. BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school its call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or dont understand. 3rd of all you get to meet your teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again. FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those students could be are next president or are next doctor, police. this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot. MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesnt want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well thats what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because its really helpful for the students. outside in the worlds there some kids who dont even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes its good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured.",5,4,6,6,4,4,1198,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"
742,731,F673BCEC3BD1,"People who value self-reliance define dependence. Following your own instincts and making your own decisions is the whole point of life in my opinion. It makes a person more independent and trustworthy. Also, helps a person learn from own mistakes. A person will always have guidance. Whether its from parents, teachers, police officers, or even a person you dont even know can give you some type of guidance. It always goes back on how the individual is going to view it. Independence is very important. Having full control and capability of standing alone can make a person realize what is best for them. Also, not being easily influenced can help a lot. Understanding what is best for you can make your decisions much easier. People need to learn from their own mistakes. Mistakes happen every day. A persons instincts may not always be right but it will benefit them in the future. Another person is not going to tell you something you want to hear or give you the assurance you need for something. They may think they know whats best for you but personally for you, it could not be the best. Knowing yourself and knowing how you like things to be done is another example of self-reliance. Seeking guidance from experts and authorities can be the right thing to do. It can save a person from debating too much on a decision. Help a person plan better for the future and not really let the person struggle. As well, as to prevent the individual to stress out of what not knowing to do. However, a persons own instincts and ideas is what makes the person value self-reliance. And know whats best for them. Who knows you better than you? To conclude, its all about self perspective. On how you view things for yourself and your future. Being independent and not rely on others opinions. Having your own thoughts and opinions.

Then, I want to change the work,because I tired of the chefs,fire,bad manager or bad pay, and I can look for another job. Now I start again,because I take a different job like a Secretary.

So this is the Surprise,the life change all the time,but we need to have positive attitude and face up to all the bad things that coming. Is the same with the school, some times the attitude change,because is impossible that somebody knows all the information about one class or two. We have differents impressions impossible to change. Because some people hate some class, for example math, but some liked. Normally I hate this class, because is just number,equations,square rules. I disagree with this class, but I know that in the future I need. But all we have differents positions, because some people love the numbers and others love another class for example, I like History why.

744,1964,2F7B0CE01B4B,"People who take decisions with guidance from experts and authorities have a higher chance of making a correct decision then others, although many prefer going with his or her own instinct or idea. Seeking guidance helps to see from a different perspective, which could allow for a better choice to be made. At some point and time we all need advice from someone who is experience or would like to know what is there perspective of another person, even though may think that they need to make decisions themselves without anyones advice or opinion. Taking decisions is a tough thing to do in general, but seeking guidance from experts and authorities can help you make this decision with less frustration or confusion. For example, we seek advice on a daily base from our teachers, following our parents foot steps, but we rely on our own thoughts, we listen to our elder closely because they have more experience. People who lose sight of seeking guidance usually end up making a wrong or bad decision. Most people tend not to think about the cause of what made this decision come back or the effect it can have on others. As for, Someone who seeks guidance it is likely that they have gone through the same situation or something like your situation and can help you make a decision that can help you but also consider the effect it may have on others. As a result, with the advice of someone whom is more experience can bring a positive outcome. Decisions are made on a daily bases from when people get up to when they go to sleep. For example, If someone has to take a decision some may fall into pressure and that led to take a decision that may not be the best and can have a negative outcome. When asking someone with experience there can be various ways or choices given to or ways to approve the situation. They can also give feedback on a decision someone was planning to take that could work out but also, could have been something that effected the person who was making the decision. As a result, If the person who was making the decision had not gone to get feedback or advice the choice of the decision could have been a decision that made to another decision allowing the decision process to be repeated and stay with a negative effect until that person has asked for advice from someone with experience. People who make their own decision get ready for life guidance could help in difficult times, although they think that It Is smart just going with the idea or instinct they have it is also a good thing to ask for someone opinion or advice. Because, they may not being seeing the bigger picture or maybe they are not seeing the pros and cons or the decision they are going to take. Asking for advice is also another way to assure that what you are going to do Is right. Therefore, whenever taking a decision it is best to ask someone for advice because it is likely they have gone through the same thing that someone is going through.

Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that. Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career.

One city I would love to buy my mansion is maybe in Calabasses or Hollywood, There are many cities to get a mansion it just depends on how much it costs and how big it is on the inside and out. Last reason I would like to live in a big mansion is that it would be my first time going to California. My mom used to live in California, in a small city near Downtown Los Angeles called Generic_City. She moved from Generic_City to California when she was fourteen (which is my age currently) and she went to high school in Generic_City and learned English there and had a job. but then after finishing one year of college she moved to Virginia and had me when she was around twenty-five. But ever since then she has been telling me stories of how it was for her in California and what places she would visit over there like Disneyland, the Hollywood sign, sporting events, and more places. I would like to visit San Francisco with one of its famous attraction the Golden Gate Bridge or Go down to Venice Beach and enjoy the beautiful ocean and its hot temperature to cool off. And those were my three reasons of why I want to live in a big mansion in California because Ive never lived in some type of big house with no houses that are connected together, It will show all the hard work that payed off o get the house, and It will be my first time going to California.",8,8,8,9,8,8,96,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
752,1946,A5E9417DBC88,"Have you ever thought about how many people are ""success by going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm?."" This are are the words that British Minister Winston Churchill once said, and I am totally agree with him, to failure without loss of enthusiasm will creeate a person with experience and knowledge. Once I fail one time people think that I am a losser, but I see it in different way because I learned what I did wrong in the first place, and I can fix the problem to make it perfect the second time. Moreover, every single mistake that I make give the opportunity to be success in life, so I will never give up for any reason. This remind a few years ago when I was in nine grade when my class took a test and I could not do it, so my teacher involve him self to make it try again as mush as I want it, so I decided to try the second time and still fail, for the first time in my life I was going to give up, until my mom told me if you never fail and keep trying you are different than others. Hardly, but I decided to try again and this time the third time I new every single question and at the end I was the kid with the best score in class. if you ever thought about giving up with your first mistake youre wrong or because you fail one time you will never be successful, keep trying until you overcome every silgle obstacle. Many people that are simbly of knowledge and success now were failure once. The important role that failure play in persouit of success. Failure show what kind of people I am and from where I coming, what makes me special and different from others. On the other hand, people might say once you fail you will keep failing for the rest of your life or that I will never be successful person, but all what people say I can use it to improve my self. To resume, what the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said "" success consist of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm.""? Its absultely true, if one day you want tio be succesful person you have to learn that there will be mistakes and fails no once,twices or maybe more times, but do not lossing enthusiasm will keep you in right way. Failure give knowledge and a better change to improve yoursel. ",5,6,6,4,5,4,2225,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
753,3015,1DB195AA7BE3,"Well the best option for my is what you attend the classes from home by way of online . My reason or my thought is, what you cant learn, in online classes, and thought what you can do it , doing others wor,k in you free time, and the school has good ideas for student what take, classes like after school just in home . So in my position is that because if you work so is you cant take the class for one hours, and you work ,and is more benefit for myself but ,each person has diferent ideas . Examples: If you not have work is more time for you ,for what you keep doing you class online. If you wnat the class . you has more time for to think best for work online and make a good work and your class. With this examples are much more for what you take any option or my option what is the best or most better already is in you home . If you not have time like time complete is for that what you take this option ya what has work and not time like for stay in the school all the time . Others examples is whent you have 18 year old has to much resposabilities and others case it s not easy . I think whent a teacher said you need that class is for one reason, and you nedd take that class but you cant took with you teacher what, is most better for you. So and my opinion or my position is take class from home in online, and to much better what ,take video coferencing. One reason because im take that option is because in my home is relax, and with food and alone and not voices and nothing, and in my home take my time for think most better i think is the most important for my work in home and i think what the work in online is not easy so need my time for to think, and good ideas and good answer, and the idea is what you learn with any option you take for this case . The student in this time has more option for any problem . One reason for what i take this option is for the time ya what much student are major or not have much time for coming a school because the work or others case. Other reasons what the student take this option is beacuse is home not in other pleace ya what not has ride or cars for take that class or classes en other pleace . My intentions is what others student take this option what is classes from HOME because is the best ,option for any case too if you want free time is more easy for you take this class or classes home by way of online, and is more choice that idea and minus dificult just what in home or online you not have teacher for explain any question so for that reason is little complicate but not impossible make you work so you cant do it , forever you want , nothing is this life is impossible but too not is easy everthing is sacrifice. Abd you has see you work good and past the class sin difucult . My reference is the option class FROM HOME BY WAY OF ONLINE. Is the best option and more benefif for learn in home, and more easy for the time or others problem and i cant wait what everthing stay good for my cass or classes .

754,162,197F95A99618,"Self-reliance allows one to follow their own path and make their own decisions. Guidance is taking advise and having other decide what one should do. while guidance can be helpful, it can also be misleading, and people arent completely following their insticts when other decide for them. Being self-reliance is important due to the fact that if someone make their own decisions, they have the freedom to problems solve. Making mistakes enables one to learn and grow. With the use of Self-reliance guidance from other human beings unneeded. Those who are self-reliant believe that other human are capable of doing the same tasks that they are. In nature, most animals have to be self-reliant in order to stay alive, for example, as a bear gets older, their parent has to, let them go off in the wild alone. Bears are able to maintain life by finding their own food and shelter. With the use of guidance, humans and animals learn what works the best for them. Self guidance allows for mistakes to occur, be corrected, and allows for people to find their own solution. Even though not knowing anything or not being able to complete the tasks alone; it is a trait that allows individual to grow and better themselves by finding their own way. Self-reliance is more than the choose and make ones own decisions. It requires integrity and the will to face up to the challenge that, ultimately betters ones character and work ethic.

I disagree with this plan because everyone will be in a bad mood they will start to skip school and do bad acts, teens will be late to work and lose there jobs, and i feel like if we add more time to school there will be no tine for family. First, the school bored wants to add more time to school. Kids and teachers are already tried, adding more time will make it worst it will start making kids wanna skip school or even start acting bad. I have a friend who will already skip school some days. he said, ""school can get to boreding who will wanna sit in class longer inside of playing soccer with you friends."" I think there will be more kids will skip school like my friend. Then, some kids or teens like the high school kids, will be later for there jobs. My sister work at PizzaHut right after school. Adding more time to school will make her late to work, they will even fire her for being late. If the school board adds more time they will be taken jobs and money away from teens like my sis. finely, family is every inporden if the school bored adds more time to school there will no time for family.

757,3523,F47F7676912A,"I met a friend online from Generic_City, therefore I went to visit him and learn a lot about his culture. In this paper I will argue about that the use of technology haves a positive effect on peoples lives and human contact. In my opinion technology haves a positive effect on people lives because they can find new jobs, meet new people , and communicate with other people that you are nervous to talk in person. Having a hard time finding a job? Theres a lot of jobs available online and you can sign up online without going to the store and ask for a job application. If your sick and cant go to work, therefore you can contact your boss online and ask for a day off and avoid getting fired by not coming to work. If you need to talk to your boss and he is not in work you can send him a online message. You can see that technology helps your job to be more easier without having any problems. Dont you feel bored knowing only about your culture? You can meet people from different culture online and learn more about there style of life. Technology helps you vision other peoples thoughts and opinion from another country. Technology is the glue that helps a lot of people from different culture work together and hate each other less. people can learn how to fix there mistakes by seeing other people online from different cultures instead of fixing it on your own tradition way that may be harder or useless. For example i learn how to fix a car much more easier by following my friend method from Generic_City. I havent seen my family for six years and only talk to them by sending text messages. Im shy and nervous to communicate with them in person. Technology helps you built that confidence to talk with other people from around the world or people that you care for. It Doesnt matter if you only communicate with them sending only online messages. At least you are expressing your feelings your thoughts and your opinion to your loves one or your friend that you are shy to talk in person. Some say technology is ruining human contact with other people in person . But they are wrong because technology helps you to meet new people, find a job, and communicate with people that your are nervous to speak with.

In some schools the principals are probably gonna require all the students to do community services because how they probably act or maybe she or he gonna make they bad people do community service.

759,1835,515244292F97,When people ask for advice from more than one more person it is because they want to be sure about the choice and they might want to be sure that they are not wrong. People will also need other peoples choices because they are not sure if they are correct or wrong. Seeking for more advice will help you know other peoples opinions and how they feel and it will also depend on the question they are being asked. People might want others opinion because they want to know if people agree or disagrees with them and they might want to see if they feel the same way or different. When people want more advice it is because they want the best for them or they want the best others. Some people might also need more advice because they are confused and they might not know what do in the life and might be worried. Advice from other people can be good or bad because some people will just give a lot of bad advice so life doesnt go good for you some people will give you good advice because they want the best for you. Asking other people for advice can help a human make a really good choice and for a human to go good in life and so that later in life they can have a good idea of what they need to work on. People will be needing other peoples advice because they dont want to have a bad vision of life because if they do they wont know what life is actually about.

760,3754,F3550CF50ABC,"Have you ever wonder how our character is formed? John Lubbock once wrote, "" Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us. Many people believe that we choose our own character by being ourself and not caring what anyone thinks however, I think that our character is formed by our friends since were always with them. For example, if my friends are always skipping school and they ask me to skip school with them and I am going to say yes since, they are my friends. What most do us do is ,that we can not say no to our friends and by saying yes, it makes up our character because now people see us as a person who skips school. Another reason on why our character is influenced by other people is, because of social media. Social media plays a big part on how our character is formed. For example, on social media there is a lot of models, and singers. A lot of young teens want to be like them so they will change the way the look and act. Since society has made it seem that if you dont look like Kylie Jenner or any other famous person that youre not pretty and because, of that people want to change their character. Finally, our character is formed by who we are around is because we want people to like us. For example, if I am at school and I want to be friends with a group of girls I will do what they like and do what they do all the time so, that they can like me. Since I want them to like me I will end up changing my personality and look just so that they can like me; this makes my character be influenced by others. I urge you to think about your character if its formed by the way you choose or if it is formed by who you surround yourself with. We should not let people choose how they want our character to be. I personally think that our character is formed by our friends, social media, and so that people can like us.",6,6,8,6,7,6,3605,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Well, many people do want to continue studying because the more knowledgeyou know, you will have a more benefits in your life. Furthermore, like the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" Hes because we never stop learning the little things in life such as: explore the world and to never stop your dream of continue your study. I agree with Emersons statement because we want to get in our goal in the survey and to never stop growing with mentality. First reason is that we have to explore the world. For example, by exploring the world we will know like the different cultures of each country or by having friends that are different country. Like my mom always said ""You have to get out of the box to learn more, to see and explore what you have at your surroundings"". Second, to never stop your dream of continue your study. For instance, if you want to grow mentally you have to study more to get the knowledge you want. The more knowledge you have, then the more great will be your job or even more better you can be your own boss. However, people will never grow if they dont continue their survey. Finally as you can see, Emersons statement ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is true because we will never stop learning, and the more you study the more knowledge you will know.

762,736,3A38B9DD6723,"In every success of a person there is always a humble story of how did they start from the beginning of their journey. At some point, being successful does not mean you have gone through a lot of struggles, but it was destined for you to be successful. In every story there are different types of story because it is based on where you came from, what education you have finished, and your status in life. However, I agree with Churchills statement because success comes after failure. Failure is really an important role for every success. If I fail, I did not hesitate to stand back for myself to pursue success. The greatest blessing in my life is being successful after I have gone through failures. For instances, Graduating high school, I wont be graduating if I did not fail and try harder to reach my goal. At some point of my life, failure is within me because I am not making any move to pursue my planned success. Planning ahead of my success is not bad actually it prepares me to become a successful individual, if I will fail at this time maybe planning my success is not a good idea because it was planned and I know what kind of success is waiting for me. Id rather be a failure with clean conscience than a successful cheater. I conclude that in every success of a person is within you. You hold your own fate. If success is really for you be thankful of what kind of success you are receiving at that moment of your life. Be humble, keep your feet on the ground.

There own way to be, the way they go through situations, makes people take decisions or actions that someone that has gone through the same situation can help them inspired or make positive things in there life. Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life. There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful. A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you. Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you. When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things. Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again. Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that. But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self. There always going to be good or bad moments sometimes you experience something that can make them be that person who inspires, I think it can definitely inspired someones action. A behavior can influence others, but everyone has different ways to think and it is not necessary if they watch someone doing a positive or negative thing will influence them is all in they way they want to act, the kind of person they are and the way they think.

764,3618,DC2E6750CDEC,"Nowadays we live in a world where everything has to be perfect if you wanna fit into this society, therefore humans have made up an exteriotype of how people are supposed to dress, look, act and live. We all have the right to do whatever we want and be whoever we are unless you want to hurt someone. We are free to do what is better for ourselves without being judge, so why do we let society control us?. People should not be afraid to be who they are and show the world what they are made of. All humans are different, we all come with different shapes, sizes, personalities, skills and that is what makes us beautiful, the power of being ourselves. Experiences make you grow and morph you into a better person, life makes you realize how bold and smart humans are, in addition to this we all have been raised differently so trying to follow an exteriotype is like letting go the opportunity you have been given by life to find out what you are made of, to find oud your power, your way of doing things and solving problems, and last but not least you are letting go the opportunity to make up your own thoughts just because you are giving people the chance to control your mind and the way you think. I totally agree with this statement, to be yourself in an environment that is constantly trying to make you something else is one of the best decisions you could make, perhaps just by being yourself you could teach someone else how to improve its personality, or maybe you could show them how to act when it comes to solve an issue, theres is multiple opportunities we miss just by trying to be someone else . All humans have a superpower within their selves that they could share with everyone, therefore, trying to fit in, follow an exteriotype and trying to act the same way the others do is equal to not take advantage of our power wisely.

Their courses of study In high school are selected to guide them toward a specific career. Many young students do not have the capacity of choosing a career at that time of age. I believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. Student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on. Inexperienced of not knowing what they want,students could make the take wrong choices about their future career. When students enter to high school they are normally around fourteen years old, young students of that age are normally not worry about their future career yet. Students mentality starts changing abut their career when they are having more knowledge about what they really what to be. When kids are around sixteen is when are maturing about their future and looking at things differently. students do not have the capacity of choosing their whole future career at the young of age. When students are force to choose a career when they first enter to high school, they could choose the wrong career. Most students know that choosing the wrong career could affect the later on in the future. Lets say that they choose a career when they enter to high school, but they are unhappy. They are going to be stuck their whole life time with something that does not makes them happy. When people work with things they like or enjoy they attempt to work harder and better. Most people change their mind almost everyday about something they like or do not like, well it is the same with choosing a career. Wasting time is something no one likes to do, and specially when is about their future. Making kids choose their career at a young age could mess them up and they would have to do things all over again. When choosing the wrong career, accepting the consequences and restart over again with a new career of their choice. Making good research,planing things out first with a good process will help with their future career. Most students are not prepare to pick their future career during high school. Most students have no knowledge of what they want to be later in life. Some students could make the wrong choice of picking a career they do not want.

Itll make everything easier. Especially the way people look at you will be changed to positive and respect. Good habit also help you create a good process. An active process creates the positive success. Restaurant would not able to serve a delicious meal, if they didnt have a good preparation. We are the same.

770,3269,ABEA8B5724EF,"The World We Live in More than 4 billion people with different culture,different background and different mentality live in our planet Earth; and each person have their own way of life style. Naturally, we have to associate our self with others, to manage our way of living. It means life push us to open our doors and see different people quality and life style. Emersons statement "" To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" In my opinion, this is wrong. Sometimes, we have to allow our self and live other people lives. It means we have to change our face mask everyday to be a head of somebody. this will help us to avoid conflicts, to accomplish our personal goals and to live in any environment. Sometimes, I fell like we should change the name "" world "" to "" different."" It explain the meaning a lot more. our world is different. every living matter have their own characters and identity. Birds can fly but lions cant. Plants, they cant move but we can. This can show us how our world is divided in many ways. This is leading us to conflicts and fights in every aspects. For example, we can see a political conflict between Donald Tranp and the Democrat. Personally I don,t agree with Donald Tranps ideas and terms. But if my community agrees and supports Tranps ideas, It is mush easier if I put a new a mask in my face and put a fake smile on top of it and pertained that i am on same track like them witch is supporting Donald Tranp. It will help to avoid conflicts between me and my community. Every strong person uses methods to accomplish their drams and goals. focusing is one of the beast way a person use it to be on the top of everybody. strong person fight to win and to be number one no matter what the situation is. Giving up is the beget enemy in their life. Not being somebody else cannot be the reason to give up in a dream. For example, If your goal is to be number one fighter, you have to fight first. Even if you have a lover personality. If you want to be a fighter you have to fight. thats the reality. You cant love some one and punch them in the face at the time. you have to switch up to get to your dreams ( to being number one fighter). American secrete service agents go to Afghanistan to catch terrorist. They are not Muslims but they have to dress up like Muslim and learn their language and culture just to make their country safe from terrorist. Being somebody else help them to achieve there goals. I believe, becoming somebody else, can help you to learn about that someone personality. This can help you to adapt the behavior of that person, witch can help you to establish a good relationship. For example, I am originally from Ethiopia living in the US. Sometimes I have to act like American just to establish a good environment around me. Thanksgiving is a well know holly day in American culture . But we dont celebrate it in Ethiopia. Just to respect for my community, i celebrate thanks giving with fake smile with others just to create a good environment in my area. In my conclusion , sometimes we should be somebody else to live in our divided society. This can also solve our conflicts , helps us to accomplish our goals and to be live in any environment. I believe we have to be logic and see the other side. This could be the smartest way to live our life with our crazy the society .

Wanting to ask your friends is nice of you, however they could be lieing to you about there real opinion. Therefor asking more then on person is better then asking just one, and you get honest opinions on what you may have asked about, or what you may have wanted to know about. People think if asking more people for there opinions on what they asked about is better then just asking one person about there opinion. For example, somebody wants to know the best why to make some great yummy cookies. Nevertheless, there may be some times were when you ask people you may get a tie between the two choices, and if you do get a tie just go ask one more person for there opinion. Many people ask more then seven to eight people some people dont have even numbers, however if you do get a even number there can always be more on one side of the vote or opinions. I was drawing in my note book and I finished a drawing, but for some reason I did not know what colors I should use. Then I asked my two sisters my mother and my father for there opinions on what colors I should use. Most of them picked the same colors, but my mother and my two sisters all picked the same color. Therefor, if you ask more then one or two people then you can find out which is the most best out of the two things you wanted opinions on. Even though some times asking more is great you still have to pick which one you like the most if there were to be a tie and you dont want to go ask anymore people for there opinions about the topic if not your fine. Either way the most voted would be best, but if you pick the least liked am pretty sure that other people may not like it. Like my grandma used to say, ""more votes are more points in life"". There are most likely 10% of people who dont ask for others opinions, and 89% of people who go out and ask people for there info about the topic or there opinion about it. Go ask your friends or family if they ever asked more then one person for there opinion. See almost everybody has asked if they havent they well soon.

774,2773,C2F34D6A76D4,"""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"". Although the word failure is the lack of success, is the loss of the ability to work normally. As humans, we all know that sometimes instead of get better in life, we currently loss our capacities to start over and follow what we want for us because as British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said ""do not loss the enthusiasm"". To being, humans fail every time in life, every episode in our life there is always a failure, it is always there for us like if we need it and maybe this is why we always wondered why failure have to happen during the most incredible episode in our life, we always think this is because we did something bad or we did not tried our best as much as we can for get that job, pass that test or even keep all our problems in line, but why failure became a big role into our daily life?. The reality of failure is not only fail, is to see what we did bad to get better, is to understand that we need to fail, understand that fail is good for us and help us to do not make the same mistakes that we did in the past because every time is a failure it is also an experience and a new lesson to success. For example, scientists tried many experiments to just get one result and they fail very often but at the end they discovered new things not just only what they were looking for. This shows that not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer and new things to discovered. Furthermore, stay positive for humans could became a big issue in our community. Every human try everyday to stay positive and see all the mistakes as much positives as we can but this became more stressful after a failure. What we all need to know is that feel stress, feel insecure of ourselves is good. We all are humans, our feelings make us more stronger than we actually are however, most people could feel depress after a failure and this is why we goes down, we loss our hope and most people stop to keep working in their goals and just get tired and feel depress. For example, there is a book that the students of Generic_School were reading last year called ""The life of an Indian"". This book is about a poor Indian boy that lives in a reservation, he has no hopes after one day his teacher introduced the Indian to a different world out of the reservation to find hope and believe in himself, follow his dreams instead to keep poor in the reservation. He fail a thousand times, but instead to get back, he goes thought his issues. This shows that stay positive after our failures even for a poor little boy is not always too hard. Clearly not everyone could do it that way, but we always want our happiness, and to get happiness, failure could became our big right hand. In conclusion, join from our mistakes is the best way to be successful, to be better in life, to keep in mind that every failure is a new experience and a new lesson. Not matter how many times you fail, there is always an answer. I am completely agree with Winston Churchill, feel enthusiasm for what go next in our life is more excited than we all think and as humans, if we start to believe in ourselves and stay positive and start to dream and also understand that failure is part of our daily, we will become more successful with the knowledge to how life really works and that life is not too hard as we all been thinking.

775,3716,E433745B3F87,"Michelangelo the artist once said, The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving mark. I agree with michelangelo statement because we want to aim our goal right, or we will ending up missing. However, there can be a better statement to explain this more. When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. Its like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that dont really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But theres people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. Its mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot. Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they dont have any papers to work , dont understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind, and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest peoples that end up missing there shot. But there are other peoples that wont let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesnt mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I dont think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us.

But online or video conferencing are very different. online can be probably a website, YouTube, (Example like be able watch how to do math) or other. video conferencing is probably like a chat room or some video live. Online is a great way to learn because I use on homework, essay, Google, YouTube, and other website. And here an of example. If I wanted how make a cake and when I used online website. It bring the website how to bake a cake. And there simple as that. But sometime if I ever get like a hard assignment and I checked it online, and it gave me the wrong answer, then sometimes the website cant be everything right. But I go ahead and tried other website to see if there a correct answered. Now let say that I had to studied a lion. I can go online to checked in Google and it bring me to whole bunch of website, and click one of those website to see if there a way to studied some lion or go to YubeTube to watch how scientist studied theses creatures. Video conference is probably like talking to a teacher or maybe live chat. And the way I think of the video conferencing is not to bad. It like youre teacher or someone is teaching you, and its like simpler to school. If I wanted to do it, like if there a problem that I need to fix then I go to video conference so they can helped me and the question. But I think its a great idea to do it.

So changing the cafeteria lunch menu to healthier options is a good idea, kids will have a better diet and will have better options when picking out what food to eat for the day. Kids will also start having an open mind to a different varieties of food. ",8,8,7,8,8,7,2943,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
782,2525,BBE8AE3B2B09,"- Is it a good idea for students to finish high school in three years? In my opinion it is not a good idea because the normal time to be in school and the normal and traditional years to spend in high school is four years. Graduating early is not a bad idea but neither is a good idea, why? because some students need to learn more before graduating. In school you just dont learn math or English, for example you also learn: How to save up money for a better future How to have a better behavior You learn how to spell some stuff correctly How to write essays There is a lot that you must know before graduating. Most of these stuff you learn in high school, and yes it might be a possibility that you can just learn all of that in three years by doing extra tests maybe staying after school, extra work, and not having any elective classes. Most of the teenagers would love to graduate a year early but doing all that stuff its a lot of stress, maybe instead of enjoying the weekends with your friends or family you just stay home finishing work from school. Some teenagers also have a job after school and doing extra work not spending time with your family nor friends can stress you a lot take a lot of time and yeah it could be worth it but what if you dont pass any of those classes or you do but graduate without even knowing whats the difference between a debit card and a credit card. In my opinion graduating early should not even be allowed because for example i have this one friend that is doing that and taking extra classes, she doesnt have any elective classes, on the weekends she doesnt go out nor spends time with her family, every time i see her instead of seeing her happy i see her stressed and tired, because she works and comes to school but shes most likely graduating this year and that something that you should be proud of, thats something that is going to help you a lot in a future and you can also start saving up money earlier than you thought, but in a future when you look back and remember your high school moments you wont have cute or fun moments to remember all you will remember is ow hard you used to work to get there and how many times you missed maybe a family dinner or a family reunion or a friends sleepover. Graduating early is actually good because you can have a better future but graduating early wont let you enjoy your life right now that we are young. Honestly i thought about graduating early one time and i told one of my friends and all he said was "" If you know you wont regret it in a future go ahead"" that got to my head a lot because this age that we are in now, is only once there wont be no other chance to go back and be 17 years old again, and to enjoy your parents and the time that you have with them right now. Basically my option is no, it is not a good idea to graduate early.",5,5,6,7,7,6,2532,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

Idle people is big problem and they always ask for help from the government,but they dont want to work. People have take hand by hand and support each other and help the people who doesnt have a job. so we are going to accomplish more if we are always doing something,or create inactivity to serve a purpose. Thomas Jefferson gave this wrote because all the people doesnt have to be a idle,government have to support the people to a accomplish something to help the people,and people have to take the activities or jobs that governments gave to them as a series. all the people doesnt have to be a idle because all people should have to work and help each other. People have to create a specific times and days work and divide the work between the people. Some people are old and wants to retirement that may get a opportunity to the other to have chance to get a job. Its really helpful when people support the other that will help everybody also, that will help the government to give more opportunities and create communities from different culture. To mix communities from many culture that help to have a people who have different job. Government have to support the people to accomplish something to help other people. Many communities today serve a different jobs at that way many people can work if they have extra time from their day. However,students are very important element to this plan and they have the future in their hand. Schools and students can help to crate a activity for the any student who interested to work with this activity. Peoples from around the world who have many different idea how to create an activity or a community. People have to take the activities or jobs that government gave as a series. Its very wonderful when people feel to their job as important job to them. Also people have to share any thing at news paper for the people to let them know that anyone need a job. people like to have something accomplish in their life. People like what Thomas Jefferson said and they accomplish what he said.

1,120,EFCC45260444,"Well on my opinion I think that the best accomplishment is when someone tell you to be your self, no need to act or being someone we are not, Its better when we can be our self on this world. When someone act something they are not, they are kinda lie about how they really are, When we chose to be something we are not, Its the worse decision that we can do. But I know that every person think different to what others think. some think that act someone they are no is something better for the world. I totally disagree. We need to stop thinking or worry what other people are going to say, we just need to worry about our self and for the people who accept how we are, with the people we can act how we really are and those people who dont judge are the best people in the world the best accomplishment a person can give is when they tell you that they accept you how you are and that we are unique, dont need to change to something we are not, that is the best accomplishment that someone can give to someone. I dont agree with what Emersons statement say because, we dont need to change to someone else. We cant let the world change how we are. I dont think the greastes accomplishment is to be in this world constantly trying to make us something else. The greastes accomplishment is that we show how we really are we all have something unique we need to be ourself in order to make the world better. Being our self with someone its kinda the best thing someone can experiment, being our self with a person is the greastes thing in the world, now and days most all the people cant be them self around other people some of them laugh at the people who act exactly how they are, some of them dont really care or pay attention to what others are doing, and I think thats how it should be. now and days we see a lot of things, people that are gay, transgender, people that are bisexual, homosexual, now we see all that for almost all the people in the world that is something normal but most of them is not. but they just acting how they really are but sometimes it can just be confusing. Something that happened when I was 16 years old is that I had a friend that always was lying of how she really was, she used to said that she had a lot of money which wasnt true, she did have like the normal she was okay with what her parent had, she said that she was rich and all that, and because of that she make a lot of friends even that ones that were my friends stopped taking to me because i wasnt how they wanted me to be, they would tell me to go party with them, to drink, smoke and all that, my answer to all the was always no, so they stopped asking me, later on they find out that the new girl didnt have that much money as she said she had, the people who I thought that were my friends told me all that and the realize that acting something we are not is not always good being someone we are not, or telling people that we have something when is not true. We all have to be honest with each other. Thats why I always tell people be yourself no matter how hard it get, the best thing we can do its to be our self, people need to start accepting others how they really are, Dont need to be two faces, that is how we saying now in days. Now in days most of people would wear say whatever they want, most of the people dont care anymore they just focus on what they are doing no in what the others are doing. When you show to someone else how you really are is because most of the time, we felt comfortable with that person.",5,4,6,5,5,7,3522,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

The communication is important and many cases because with communication you can do many things, like if you dont understand something you can tell somebody for help and all the persons on the groups can practice all days to do a great work,and also some students need a lot of help so students that know more can join to the groups to help the others,but sometimes is not because some students dont know how to do the work sometimes it because they dont understand sometimes is because the language is a problems for some students so there is good to make groups to help them,Third it can be an experience to work in groups because some students that dont know each others later on they can be friends and work in groups it can be helpful to students,but also to school because work on groups students can understand more and they can get betters grades also work in groups and a a good relationship it can be helpful not only at the school it can be helpful like in your home with the family and not to get in trouble with their, but also it can help you on your job to work well and not to have problems with the people that you work with,is like on soccer that why it call a soccer team because they help each others they share new or more strategies that it can help others to do a great job because work in groups students have more and betters benefits to do a great job,Finally is good to have a good communication in groups because with a great communication all the the group can understand each others and is important to have a good relationship in the group so like that they can do a better job and some students help others and that is great to be generous with others because if you help to someone that need help other people is going to help you on what you need and is a lot much better to work in group than alone sometimes when you are working alone and you got stuck in something no body is going to help you,but if you are working with more people in group they going to help you on what you need but most of the teachers wants to students work alone sometimes is good that students work alone because sometimes students got distracted for the people on the group and the teachers dont wants students to copy each others sometimes is good to work alone maybe better concentration,but sometimes is not that good to work alone because sometimes you got stuck in somethig, but if you are working with a group they are going to help you i would like to see more teachers that put more students to work in group i dont think students would like to work alone than with a group is better an sometimes is more easy and faster In conclusion, is a great idea for me thats teachers make students to work in groups on my opinion is much helpful to they work in groups instead to work alone,because when people work in groups they have betters ideas and they can do a better work with more interesting and more opinions is better to do a great job and also have a great relationship and a great communication is so important to work in a group and some students know more than others so the students thats know more is good that they help the others on what they need and is good to work in group so like that you can know others people i hope teachers continuing making groups to students can learn more than what they know and work in group it can help you on your life because if you got a job and many people work there too but you dont like to work with others people as a group the boss is going to kick you out only because you dont know how to work as a group and if you only like to work alone it can be a problem if you dont understand work with others people is better always more ideas,opinions like that you can do a better work and it can help your future job and the rest of your life sometimes some students dont like to work in groups sometimes it because they dont know others people,but i thing if teachers would like to students work more in groups i thing they would like it and they can have more communication students would like to work with a group, I like to work with a group because sometimes i dont know what to do so others students help me to do a great work and we all share other.",7,5,6,6,4,5,1608,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"
3,37,E65D5A2616D2,"Imagine an old proverb said honestly was the best policy. What would you if some one used honesty in a bad was would you disagree or agree? I would agree because some acts of honesty can really mean a lot to someone. An old proverb says honesty is the best policy because it is the key of telling the truth and it can also create new friend ships in life. I would agree that honesty is the best policy, but if you miss treat honesty it can be very lethal to your trust with people. To lose someones honesty is very hard I have seen car crash which someone got severely hurt and the person who crash into him won the court battle because he was not showing honesty. My father has told me honesty is a great part in peoples life. My father has told me stories were his friends have seen people get robed and their honesty has helped find who did it and convict the criminal. Even just a little bit of honesty can help anyone. But when you use honesty you should never use it in a way that might hurt someones feelings. I once was playing a game and the opposing team was not being very honest which hurt some of the kids feelings on my team. But a persons honesty can always change at all times. I once had a friend who was never honest but changed through out his life and started to realize why honest is so important. I even have made new friend ships in life just from being honest. As we can see you might be able to get something from being honest. If you are always honest people respect you. I have been in instances ware honesty has created respect for me. When you show some form of honesty it creates a good environment around you which can make good relationship you. But when people use honesty to hurt your feelings by not being honest it makes you feel like you just have been hit by a train or it feels like you have been betrayed. Once I was walking down my street and saw that there was lots of police cars out side one my neighbors houses. I heard that she got robed a couple months ago and found a witness that saw who the thief was because the witness was honest with the police it helped find who did the crime. As I can see honesty is the best policy. In conclusion, no matter the incident that happened you always should be honest. Even in the future your actions can be justified from your honesty. Honesty is the best policy because it impacts you to do the right thing and creates a good environment. When being honest it shows that you have a high self steam which is can be very good for you in the long run.

5,970,0A1482CD6163,"I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington) because I believe that this statement means that even if there is a problem there is a chance for you to improve next time. One reason why I agree with this statement is because you can improve for next time. For example, lets say you are having difficulty with one of the subjects youre learning at school and you have an assignment due the next day. So you try your hardest on this assignment but when you turn it in the next day you score a low grade,and you go ask your teacher if you can make up that assignment but they say no. Now in this situation the student can learn for this and take this as a chance to improve for next time. Another reason why I agree with this statement is because something unexpected might come out of that problem. One way is that lets say you are doing a group project for on of your classes and theres a few people in your group that arent contributing to the group. So you decide to try your best to take the lead of this project and try to get everyone to express their ideas. This shows how a group of student go through a problem with people not wanting to participate but then the student decides to take the lead of the project and try to include everyone. My last reason why I agree with this statement is because you can do your best on something. One way you can improve the way other view you is by trying your best to solve that problem. For example, if you are having trouble with something then you can try to ask people you know are a teacher for help. This is so you can find the best solution to your problem and do your best. In conclusion, I agree that "" A problem is a chance for you to do your best."" (Duke Ellington).

6,957,F886A2B6F351,"Its a good idea to have homework club at your school. Every school should have homework club at least three times a week. Homework club is a club where teachers help you with your homework or if you need help understanding a subject. Homework club helps students get to learn a little bit more about that subject, be more active with theirs friends, and it makes them have more confidence about their work. Homework club is a big help for students. Theres so many stuff you can do at homework club and that is finishing a project with a friend, studying for a test/quiz, or even finishing your homework early. At homework club you get so much help from the teachers. You can finish a project with a friend and when you do that it helps you be more active with that person. If a student ever has a doubt with a question about their project, then they can go to homework club and get some help with their project. The best part about homework club is that when more students come, we get to help each other with our projects. Its like a community were we help each other with any questions we have. Projects are really hard when you do it by yourself, but if you go to homework at your school then you will get all the help you need. If your having trouble then the best place to go is homework, so you can get some help. Another thing you can get do at homework club is study for a test/quiz. The teachers will help you make flashcards, help you over the study guide, or even play a game of kahoot. If you didnt know what kahoot is, kahoot is a game where it helps you a lot before a test/quiz. I can say that kahoot is like a study guide but form into a game. Many students cant really study for a test/quiz when they are at home, because they cant concentrate studying when they are alone. So if you go to homework club they will help you study for your test/quiz and you will for sure not get distracted. I recommend everyone to come to homework club at least three times a week so you can get help studying for a test/quiz or if you need help with something else. If you go to homework club then you will pass your test/quiz, cause homework clubs will help you prepare yourself for your test/quiz The last thing that homework clubs helps you is get your homework done early. the teachers will explain everything perfectly and I guarantee you will learn even more then what you learn in class. Math teachers, Science teachers, History teachers, and English teachers are going to teach students so much more. You can go to homework club and do your homework early so you dont have to worry about doing it at home. In homework club teachers explain the homework to the students but with more details. What I mean is that the teachers will teach you more about that subject. Homework club is one of the best club their is. It helps students learn more about the subject, it also makes them have more confidence, and it makes them be more active with your classmate at homework club. Homework club is a community full of amazing students and teachers. Theres so many things teachers at homework club help you with and that is Helping you get your projects done in time, helping you study for a test/quiz, and helping you finish your homework early. We can achieve this goal of establishing homework clubs in schools, but we need help from student to make this goal happen. Homework club would be boring and not helpful if we didnt have some amazing teachers at school volunteering for homework club.

Also, they are many students that the fist thing they do when they get out of school is to play videogames. Next, some childs know how how to do their work, but they only need motivation to do it. Teachers do fun games for the kids to do their work in a fun way. Many prefer to play games, and not to do their work. All students likes to play, so teachers make games that is related to the homework to the students do it, or make it more easier for them. Furthermore, students dont write their homework in the agenda, so they forget to do it, or sometimes they are playing and dont remember to do their work.

10,3256,EEE6067CF9B5,Some schools have programs that older kids can help younger kids. If they dont know how to somethings in school or out side of school. Or they are there just there to assist other kids that more help then other kids this can be helpful. For older kids that they might have to teach something new that they did not know or just teach something that they had some hard time in when they where leaning this in school. And can be more helpful for younger kids because they might have to work a little more harder and get more. Challenged more then they get at home or school and they get through there homework at this after. School program and then when they get back to school they have there homework done and then there homework. Might not be late or they might just be more on top of there stuff and when they get home they just can relax and play some games or just go outside. And have good jobs later in there lives and I think that more kids should have this. Chance to get this time to study and get better programs in there school. Because we have good programs and then if most of every school have likes programs they can get help by older students and younger students can help they older can help by helping the younger and the younger if they are not doing homework and if they are done with home work they can help other younger students. so they can get the help and the assisting that need or might need because if you are good with some like math but then the homework gets harder they might just need just need some more time or more time study and going over there past home work to see if he can or she can solve that problems or if they cant that why there are the older student. That can them help he or she with the home work or projects. They can help one and other to finish faster and get their projects done if they wish to or they can just work on it just by them self. and then when most of the kids are done with homework witch most wont be they might go on there computers or they can go outside and play some outside games witch so half would go out side and the other will stay to keep this program fun and not just doing homework and classwork all day long.

11,3174,424005E31A04,"Do people ever told that having a positive attitude is the key to success in life ? Well,that true for you to be success in life you got to have a positive attitude . when you talking around attitude is how we act ,talk ,and how we deal with thing that are happening. Say that person you are working with and the person next to you do or says something that is not so great, and let say that you were really mad and very upset about ,and you choose not to fight or talk back to him/her. In my preview I would say you act base on what happen and you had a positive attitude about what just happen. Attitude can be a big problem for some people and Sometimes you just need to have a positive attitude .When your thoughts think that positive attitude is the key to success will you not wrong ,I know that when you choose to have a positive attitude it depend on what going on and how you want to handle the matter .For example you are on your way to the school and you meet one of the teacher let say Mrs. Jade,will Mrs. Jade asks if you are okay and she ask you if you are gonna come to school because you have many days of absent at school , and say that you have your own personal problems and you just dont want to tell her about it .So you decide not answer her because you are not in a good mood and you might talk to her rudely and she would think that you have an attitude or bad behavior and thought if I have problem with her or be rude to her it would be the worse so I will not say anything .That would it and you would just kindly walk way. Attitude can be anything in life attitude is not just the way you treat other it can be how you manage things and how you think and act with a positive attitude. When you think back it can also be something that create your connection with those who are in your surroundings. For example when you meet a someone for the first time and you were nice to them everything about you was positive and you were did not hind anything from her and that person might draw a liking into you .And you might end up being their friends or bests. The thing of having positive attitude is that many people might not act the same way as you ,so you have to be the one being positive .People say a beautiful heart comes from in and out of that person .It the same thing with having a great positive attitude when think about it people do and say what they want to said and no one is stopping them .So with positive attitude is the same way people do it because they want to and even if you say that you want to stop them I dont think that you would do it. Because it their choice to do what they want to do .Say when you want to eat can anyone stop you and if not then why would they stop you from what your doing .These things we do it so that our life can be great base on what we see we act,make choice ,and choose the right or wrong that why everything we do in this world we do it with positive attitude .And think about when you are making choices do you have to be a greater thinker or smart no all you have to do is have a great idea and a positive attitude to it when you say it because sometimes thing are easy said then done .when a person is saying something or doing something they have a way of doing and saying that this day .when people are talking they use attitude to do or say something and you have to away think that your the only one doing but sometimes it not just you it might be the other way around and you might say oh ,so that how it done .What lm saying is that positive attitude can be a good thing to those who know what it means to them and why they are having it. Have you ever meet a person theyre so nice to you when no body is around ,but when people are around they act so mean to you ,and some people are really nice to you ,because they mean it and they want to be your friend and when you at some of these thing does have something to do with positive attitude and most of them just put on an act and when your the one they doing this to sometimes you dont if having positive attitude or not everybody knows what we do in the future but I know one thing for sure .That if you have a positive attitude ,The your future clear for sure because when you about the future the only thing that comes to mind is how are success and all you need is positive attitude and focus on what you can do because believing is living .And if you believe you have to have that positive attitude going ,because once you start a journey one can never stop until its end ,Positive attitude can be the thing that can help you do what other cant do ,if you ask why it because you have a life and that most of the people in the the world need positive attitude so that they can have a peaceful life and one most never stop until you find what your looking for. Having a good attitude can not only be the key to success in life but it can help you be a wonderful person.

These students might be passing through hard situatons, such as: economical crisis, issues at home, need of independence or any other problems that is not allowing them to be in school the time they should be in, but some people do not need a short period in high school because of they are struggling, this group of people might want go to college earlier or get a job as soon as possible for personal reason. In the United States, we live everyday a situation call ""migration"", this type of situation make people to leave their countries for some valid reason, regardless the issues they will have coming into the country. In fact many of this people is looking a better life here, the life they could not have in their countries because of their governments, scarcity of resources, scarcity of jobs, low wages, dangerous areas and many others situations that nobody would like to live. Between this group of people we can find students that were in school in their countries, but when they come into this country and they get in high school, as a result of the ""bad"" education from certain countries, these students are settled in grades where they should not be because of their age and learning capacity. This is one of the main reasons why high schools and the departament of education should have programs where this group of students can find better opportunities of learning without changing the time they should be in school. In another point of view, for school districs to offer this type of programs, the country will get benefits because of the students will get in college earlier and we are going to get a lot of professional people that can help to improve our nation. Economy will be a good reason to want get out of high school one year early, this is because many people do not count with the amount of money that is needed to go to college, many students prefer to work to make money for their payments instead of getting financial help from the bank that they will have to pay with higher interest in the future. Other students think about the possibility to go to college out of the country because of the high cost of them, but they still have to work and get extra money. The departament of education of the United States is encharge for all these changes and they should take this option because it would benefit people, would benefit the country, and will benefit students in general. The program could work if students stay after school or they come at night, this would give them more opportunities to make a plan where they can work hard to reduce their time in high school, it is really important to keep on mind that many students already work in their free time and they might not be able to do an extra time in high school, that is why this offer should be analyzed in order to the student benefit, but at the same time giving the enough amount of knowledge they will need.",8,7,9,9,7,8,1323,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

They can be difficult to change, but they arent almost impossible to change because there are ways that can help you change your first impression. A thing about first impression is to question yourself on is ""how can I change my own first impression?"" A lot of people say its almost impossible to change your own first impression, but what they dont realize is that they arent thinking hard enough to comprehend to understand why they arent almost impossible to change, so they instead just dont even try and use more of their cognitive ability. Whats important about first impressions is having to say something that will impress others. When you use more of your cognitive ability, then youll be able to come up with better first impressions. Once youre able to come up with a better first impression; youll find it easier easier than what other people said based on their opinion. In conclusion, first impressions are a lot easier to change when you think about how youll change your first impression and when you come up with a better one, but it takes time to develop (also dont over think it because this can cause stress and also wont help you use more of your cognitive ability).

17,2166,12F89E196E97,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are actually doing."" Idle refers to people who are not busy or keeping themselves occupied to their powers or implements. You would think being inactive serve a purpose, but personally i think it does not. To be occupied gets you to accomplish a lot in life. People who do not keep themselves busy tend to not get far in life. In other words, to not be engage in work or activity is a very poor thing;there could be plenty of opportunities for you, but just because you are inactive you could miss these awesome opportunities. When we lack the ability to work or to keep ourselves occupied we are being inadequate. People who do not push or work themselves never actually really make it anywhere in life. Therefore, if we are always ""doing"", we will not fail to meet our expectations. If athletes were never idle or always ""doing"" some of them would of never made it in life. However, inactivity does not serve a purpose because when you are inactive or simply not doing anything you miss out on what life has to bring you. We would accomplish so much if we always kept ourselves busy neverless. People who lack strength or courage are inactive. So when teachers say use your time wisely they are telling you to be Idle. It is wonderful when you are doing, being active, or pushing yourself because when you do these things you never miss out on any opportunity. Lastly, when you are Idle you serve a purpose for yourself, family members, and you encourage others around. People who are active push themselved to do better. Being active can get you a good job because people will speak highly of you and recommend you to others. You ever heard of ""hard work makes the dream work"" when you put yourself to work anything is possible. Your peers around you will look up to you because you get stuff done and it would push them to do as you do. In conclusion, Thomas Jefferson says when you are determined never to be Idle you serve no purpose and you are determined to get knowhere in life. Keeping yourself occupied can get you to places in life where you thought you could never be because you are putting the effort. People who move with no purpose are called lazy people these people do not accomplish as much as those who work.

19,3231,B3F0F2F6487F,"should the school extend the school day two hours and four-day a week? people have different opinion about being ten hours in the school day. some people think it is a good idea for their kids to be ten hours at the school day. However, I believe that being ten hours in the school day it is not a good idea, because it dose not help for the energy and the resources, everyones brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. First, being ten hours in the school day dose not help in the energy and the resources; Because we spend the same amount of time at the school, But instead of spending an eight hours a day in five-day a week we will spend ten hours a day in four-day a week. so we are going to spend the same amount of energy in both. Second, everyones brain needs to a break. If we spent ten hours of our day at the school we are not going to be having that much time to live our lives, do our work and see our family. everyone needs to relax and sleep enough during the day to focus more and do more good at school. Finally, ten hours is too much for a kid to spend in a day at the school. kids will dislike going to school. they will get tired. for example when my sister stay a little longer after school for extra work, she comes back home so tired, not talking to anyone and doing noting, because she is tired of being a little bit longer at the school. In conclusion, as you have read. extend the school day two hours a day in four-day a week is not a good idea because it dose not help to conserve energy and the resources, everyones brain needs to take a break in the day and ten hours working in the school day is too much for a kid. so what we can do is not extend the school day two hours a day, so all the kids can do good at the school, focus more and live their life happy.

People can change their impressions;in so many ways of thinking they can: ask for help, ask for advice,and talk with someone about it. Impressions can be held in different ways of being they can be held by trying to go for something at the store,eating ice cream, talking with someone close.

A example from my life is when life just decided to punch me in the face, just change my life. About two years ago when i was in freshmen year of high school, my doctor told me that i have a bad arteria is the vein that gives oxygen to the heart, So i had to have a heart surgery. This is how everything started, One day I woke up got ready to go to school, went to school like usual. at the time I was in middle school, Generic_School, I was playng soccer and i have got to tired went to the bathroom I felt like something wasnt right, I drop to the ground and felt nausia, I didnt give it any atention and just kept going with my day like normal. Almost around six months later i had another mini heart attack, But at the time i didnt know what it was. I was just laying on my bed and i just started feeling a sharp pain in the chest, But it went away in about 30 minutes. when everything got serious was later on about another six months later when I was at school at the time i was almost finishing freshmen year at Generic_School, my chest started to hurt badin class, So what i did was go to sleep in class and see if it would go away, Then when i woke up the pian wasnt there anymore. I wen to my house and about 4 hours later the pain started again and it was bad so I told my mom and we went to the emergency room in the hospital. At the time i had a infection in my trought so the doctor said that it was doe to the infection, then they told me to go to a heart specialist. The apointment was on a monday my mom had decided that we wernt going to go so she call the place to cancel the appointment and they told her that it was important for me to go because it was something serious. They told us that what i had was mini heart attacks, he told us that i was going to have to get a heart surgery because there was more posibilities for me to die of a heart attck then to die during the surgery, so i didnt have any other choise more then take the chance and have the surgery done. The whole time i was pissitive, I wasnt scare at all i didnt have bad thoughts. So the day that i was going to have my surgery finally came. The doctors read to me all the chances that i had to die if something went wrong bacuse they had to stop my heart and conect the veins t a machine so they could work on my heart, i was just calm and thinking possitive all the time with a smile on my face and having a possitive attitude. I had my surgery and everything went perfect in a week i was out of the hospital, In about three months i coulnt wait any longer so i got a job start working making moneyand going to school, always possitive.

For example people with a positive attitude they try so hard to be success in life but they cant they keep trying, trying and nothing happens. now some people with a bad attitude are success they dont even have to try to work hard to be success.

Most of the students are preparing for good colleges and some of the colleges you have to stay so many years to finish them. and also from my experinse it is hard enough as it as in four years but i know so many students have done it before and they sucssed on it. and i know some student have done it too but in 2.5 years. and i almost have done it and it have been good for me but it need alot of work and you have to study hard and foucces in your school and do your homwork and get good grades and dont do any pronlems in school becasue if you did any thing wrong you are going to stay more years at the school. it is good to graduate early whenn you are young so you will have alot of years in college to be a heigher education. at the end i would say and support every one that want to graduate early because it is good for their future and i have to say thank you for the people that they are helping me to do that.

26,125,9BF2607D4878,"The statement is ""the first impression is almost impossible to change"" which is a different feeling for everybody, but for me, I disagree. In fact, the first impression is really important and sometimes true, but I think the first impression does not define a person, an object or a situation. Having a first impression is a human reflex, like having an opinion or a judgment. We are doing it unconsciously. The first impression is most of the time not real, you need to search deeper to make an opinion and when you really have an opinion, then, the first impression is not important anymore. For example, when you meet someone, your first impression might be that you think she is supercilious and even a little bit mean. Therefore when you really get to know her deeper then you will find that she just had a bad day and that she is nice and sociable. Sometimes its the contrary, a person seems really nice but in reality she is not, so your first impression was wrong. It is not good to stay on a first impression because most of the time its wrong. Moreover, the physic, behaviors or attitude can change an impression. If the person do not smile and seems to be rude but in reality is the nicest person, then it will be awkward for you because you thought she was bad. Sometimes a person can have a bad reputation because of the first impression he shows and it is not his fault, some persons just dont smile every time. Sometimes you can be disappointed because you didnt get to know the person because of your first impression. The first impressions is not only for people but also for a situation or an object. For example if you are in a library and you want to buy a book, the first thing you are going to do is looking at the cover of the book. If its pretty you will more easily choose this one instead of a book with a black cover and only the title, because it is your first impression. But your first impression is wrong because you didnt take time to read the resume and you will find soon that the pretty book is actually boring instead of the black book which is really interesting. An object can look nice but have a bad quality. The first impression is the color and the shape of the object, like the physic and the attitude of a person. In conclusion I would say that the first impression is sometimes right but most of the time its not. In my opinion, you must not keep in mind your first impression of a person, its most of the time wrong. You have to get to know the person to build your own opinion. It is normal to have a first impression, like judging, but you must not take the habit to stick with your first impression.

27,938,E73CF852AC12,"Positive attitude is the key to be successful in life. Most of the time older people or somebody you dont really know they will tell you to give all your effort and think smart. By having a positive attitude people feel more happy and comfortable. For example,when they have a positive attitude people stars to give you some advises from the experiences they have been through. In life to have a positive attitude we have to know how to deal with our problems even tho sometimes we might think we can not do it but, there is always a solution and after all that has happened we learn how to have a smart thinking and not giving up. Having a positive attitude makes people have a good communication with others. When having a conversation with another person you can learn more about anything. Sometimes the people who has good skills or positive attitude in their jobs or any other occupations they have the opportunity to earn a higher position in their job. For example,all managers have that position because they have showed that they can have a good attitude with themselves and other people. This gives them the chance to be a successful person in life and help to become as them. Education is also a big influence and how a person can have a good attitude and good values. Life teaches people how to control their emotions and help those who need it. In life to become successful people needs to have a goal and a plan how they are going to accomplish that. I know sometimes we have many problems and we think it not possible to have a good attitude but, there is a way how to deal with bad attitude and always have in mind the goal we want to accomplish one day. There is always people who is going to say negative things to others instead of give them advises. Also many people think they can not do it after they try the first time and did not happened how they expected. People has to keep in mind that not always everything will be easy to get and there will be obstacles in life that will make you feel that you can not get what you want. By thinking and having a positive attitude people can make it become true just don not give until you have reached your goal. In conclusion,in my opinion having a positive attitude can make people become successful in life. Be some educated persons and listen to what others say to them. Many older people or family might not want to see you fail and that is the reason for those who keep a positive attitude so they will be proud of those who protrude in life. Giving up would never be option for those who really have the desire to accomplish what they want. It is not going to be easy to always have a positive mind but,if the person really wants that then it will give all its effort.",7,7,7,7,7,7,3340,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Father and mother are the best persons, to share our everything in our life. They have a lot of experience and important matters in life. They can feel us In every situation. We always should ask from our mother or father, about our life decisions. we should have someone to hear us and support us. Our parent experience can be a lesson for us. Experiences make our life.

Everyone was sad about him because he was younger and he dont know about anything. His mother and father told him to finish school first then open a fast food, but he didnt listened to them. He leaved the school and started his work. In the first he was so happy, but after a few months he become sad. When he saw his all friends going to school and he works he felt sad. He was so regretful, because of what he did. He didnt listen to his parent and he just did what he wants. Than he came to his parent and said sorry, because of not sharing his idea with his parents.

His father was so happy that his son come and asked him for showing the good way. His father guide him and show him that what should he do. He went to school and also continued his work too.

I also think this because students spent 8hrs in school more than what they spend at home. My other idea is that i think the schools around that county should have a essay in all schools asking students about how they feel about this decision. The county should take the students decision as a answer about what they think because our ideas matter too. Also the school should be thinking about the students benefits of being in school for longer and for less not just to one side. I think if they did that they point of view will change a lot knowing what students think also it would help them know about what students they are dealing with that would be a great advantage for them.

People can deside is they want to know the person better. People can change in there own way, or if they really want to change they need to deside to be better in life.

The person can not change at the first impression, they most need to have the specific time to change. One of the most important fact to change is time. For example, is a person is fighting with a employee at the Ice cream story, you can not can change that person that way the he think. Maybe you must wants that. He need to realise what he is doing is something wrong .The person most have his reason for the fight. The person need time to change not at the firt moment the you meet. Most people can determine that they need time to cange. Another example of that is someone have a really bad adiction to do someting that do not have none benefict for his life. You most want to change that person. The first impression that this person make in you most be the most terrible impression. First impression is impossible to change. First impression is actually what the person make in you. Sometimes is not the best impression that the person make .Sometimes you must want to change that at the same moment even is you do not know the person. The person can change with effort is you talk to the person and let her know that what is doing is not right. Maybe the person can change but not at the first impression that need take time.

Sometimes teenagers not follow the law especially on weekend. Having the curfew in the city will be more helpful for their life. Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law, and teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. Firstly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will always follow the law. For instance, Generic_Name lives in Generic_City Virginia and he said that the law here is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be on streets or anywhere else. He always follow the law and keep him self out of trouble. If the city adopted the curfew after that the teenagers will start breaking the law after these hours. Therefore, every state and city should require curfew for teenagers. Secondly, Curfew keeps teenagers out of trouble because teenagers will never put them salve in a trouble that may hurt them some way. For example, My two friends went outside to have some fun and it was weekend. Saturday night there were out to get some ice-cream for them salve and family. The police stop them in their half way and asked them about what are they doing at this time outside;however, he said that you guys know that the curfew is after 10 p. m. teenagers should not be outside. They lied to police that we were in hospital with our mom, and in our way we bought some ice-cream also. Thus, teenagers never put them salve in a trouble so having curfew is much better then not having it. Some people argue that, having curfew in a city or state is wrong because they think its interfering in young peoples lives. This point is true that curfew keeps teenagers from getting in a trouble. However, curfew can safe teenagers lives because in this age they dont know wrong and right they do what they like, and what they are interested. Curfew unfairly interfere in young peoples lives because some teenagers have their own rules, and they dont listen to anyone. Lastly, cities should have curfew to safe teenagers lives and do not adopted the curfew. In conclusion, the importances of curfew is to have a better and safe life in your city. Teenagers have the ability to follow the law and get safe of trouble. Some teenagers does not put their self in trouble even if they lie they never get in trouble.

We can not forget that people that have special cases, well, that people have at the same time special programs that school offers, some Schools are able to receive them and work with them at school, and other Schools can give you an option to work from your home, Those programs were designed only for people that born sick or have problems since born. If you dont want to go to School, you must have a reasonable excuse, because you have to apply for it, you can not decided that youre not going to School because you dont want it, and you want to learn from home. Specially from public school that request a letter and proofs that you can not assist to school, and then They will analyze your case. Today you have the resource to learn from home, you should think about it, don not make mistakes that can affect your life in future. At least you have a special case.

42,272,D06EDF336392,"A city council is debating for the adoption of the curfew for teenagers. That create an enormous positives and negatives reactions the rabble who is for the curfew and who disagree this and said we are in a free country. This laws prohibit to see a teenager on the street at 10 P.M weekday and midnight weekend. In this prompt we will show the reason why the curfew can be a marvelous benefit for teenagers and keep them out of trouble. In beginning, the decision is reassuring for the parents. For example, when the parents know where their children are that can help them to stay calm. Because sometime we have a parent suffering from high blood pressure and dont know where their children are can affect them. In this case, parents are the main piece of the education of children. When the parent stay at home with their children that can help them to planning the schedule of the sleeping period to be the optimal version of parent of their children. If this case, parents can have a few control into the life of their children. the idea there is to leave a parent with their children to help them to be close and to know each other. Because we have a french proverb what said ""Tell me who do you walking with and I will tell you who are you?"" And the best people for approve your friend and answers us the fabulous question ""Who are you?"" Is our parents. Furthermore, this law would reduce work of 911. Because everyone know that most of the crime are commit at night and that can not be the moment where we leave our teenagers outside. For example that will help the 911 to reduce call for emergency at night. Because we never know what can happen in a teenagers party, they can do a prank call challenge, they can have a fire in party, or they can fight. In other case, the law can heaven preserve them from eventual aggression in the minor. We do not know who the people who walk in our street and their mentality. We have immensity and variety of people in our street like drugs dealer, a daring, and a rabble we do not go to let our children walking in this environment at night. In this case, the law can decrease a criminality rate in the street. Because teenager are the principal target of people in the street because they are easily influenced. This easily influenced can associate them with a sort of people disreputable. In auditioning, the curfew can help a teenagers in their education. that can help teenager to study. Because the first priority of a teenager is school and they can have time for studying, that decision can create the future amazing men and women in the future for emergence of our city. In this case, that can help teenagers to sleep early. To have a fantastic performance in everything we doing, we need to have our eight hours of sleeping that is also the case of school. To have a marvelous performance at test and at class we need to sleep the time recommend by a specialist. In this case, teenagers can learn to be organize and responsible. Because the curfew can sharpen their sense of priority what is actually to back home before 10 P.M. And this sense of priority can help them to be a wonderful adult. Finally,to sum up the situation, we saying our vision about the beneficial effect of the curfew in our marvelous city. The beneficial effect what can impact our the families situations, the local authority, the society and in school, or class. That rule can be very strict for some people, but that is after a long analyze the best way to put our teenagers safe.

43,460,327F4BCC9E4B,"The idea that businesses have made is very important. Finding means to conserve energy and resources are important in our daily life. Most people use energy and resources in their day to day activities which put more pressure on the use of energy and resources. This four-day work week will conserve the workload on energy and resources. I agree to the fact that my school should follow the four-day school week with each day consisting of ten hours. When the school time is extended, it will make students have more time to do any unfinished assignments in a particular class. Students can do more work and cover many topics in a day. This will make teachers do a lot of work in a day. For instance, any project that you didnot finish can be done the next day in class, students will have enough time to ask questions about what they are being taught, they will have sufficient time to go to teachers and practice more if they have other questions related to what they were taught. This will make classes fun and more entertaining. Students will have adequate time to study and understand the concept of what they are being taught in class. If this adaptation is considered in my school, it will cut down the usage of energy and resources. The school uses more energy and resources due to the population of the students. Some examples of such equipment that uses higher energy are as follows : Air Condition, Laptops, Printers and many others. These machines uses high barometric pressure. Throughout this four-day school week, we can conserve the energy we waste in the school. Others may say students might get bored due to the increase in hours because they are used to the normal daily routine but hasnt considered the benefits of it. When this is taken into consideration, more energy and resources can be kept from wastage. In summary, the four-day routine and extending of time will be beneficial to conserving energy and resources in the shool. This will make students work hard in class, reduce the work load on energy and resources, seek more help from teachers if they are finding difficulties in a particular class.

Having a good attitude helps people to be more intelligent and to face their problems. It is important to have a good attitude because people can face their obstacles, it gives them many opportunities and experiences to learn. Nobody is perfect in the world, everyone has obstacles to face forward. But having a good attitude can help them to face their obstacle, it help them to never give up, like famous actors of movies, shows, and many more. Before they came to be famous they face their obstacles to be someone in life. They past through many things to be came successful, but they face them with a good attitude and yep sometimes with bad attitudes. Some actors still have some obstacles to face, but they face them with good attitudes. On the other hand, having a good attitude gives people many opportunities. People often have opportunities but they dont know how to confront them. A positive attitude helps people in their life because it gives them many opportunities, like Generic_Name, the mother of a girl, who had face many problems in her life. She never give up and she always was with a positive attitude, when Generic_Name was 30 years old, one of her sons died from Cancer. At that time Generic_Name was very upset, but an opportunity appear on her life. She decides to take the opportunity with a good attitude. Generic_Name always has a positive attitude even during in a difficult time. Otherwise, having a good attitude gives people many experiences. Experiences appears in people life so they can learn from them, but having a good attitude makes then more fun and interesting. One of the experiences that learn is that when you give money or food to a homeless they shared it with other homeless with a positive attitude. They think about others, even when they dont have to much. A person once said, When give more, you receive more, that is true because when the homeless shared something with others they receive more but they wait with a positive attitude is like they feel happy, they have a good attitude but at the same not all of them have a positive attitude some of them have a negative attitude because they had a hard time. Overall, having a good attitude can help people anywhere in the world. A good attitude help people in their future they have obstacles to face, opportunities to take, and amazing experiences to learn. Sometimes people imagine their life with having a bad attitude, and everything that they have will be rare because they will not have the chance to learn or to experience. To the contrary of people with good attitudes are awesome because they are intelligent and they have an incredible wisdom.

49,1300,8BA694ACE2D9,"Being Against An Extended School Day - Generic_Name Education can be considered to have an immense and influential extent over the preparation of individuals within the constantly expanding world. It can determine how a future employee may react to a circumstance or perhaps how they may solve it. Entire generations have been based upon education. Fundamentals such as algebra and language skills learned by these individuals have sculpted the process for man to touch the Moon and to cease global crises. All of this has possibly resulted in the world we exist in today. My perspective on the circumstance is that the school board should not increase the schools schedule due to the following: the current schedule already establishes 7 hours of probable physical and intellectual progression, students can experience more unproductive and negative entities, and that the addition of one and a half hours may produce incompatibilities towards both student and related individual schedules. Beginning with the 7-hour process, students enter the building and perhaps have already encountered a dilemma. Certain peers may have caught the bus late or arrived earlier than allowed to. Afterwards, they could be in their classes trying to understand how a certain concept functions with another and may simultaneously be attempting to concluded a page of homework. Moving from class periods to lunch, they may find themselves perplexed at what they are going to do with their lockers present condition. Even at the end of the day they may be questioning what to do with their best friend while they both have separate projects due tomorrow. In essence, a students day can be of highly troubling challenges as well as instances that an be excessively stressful in relation to the students alone. With the prolonging of the day present, multiple casual difficulties may be amplified whilst new forms of faults can be felt by many students. A select few could include having to finish more assignments, receiving an increase of homework, and quite more. Certain subject periods may become uninteresting after critically focusing time upon them, and other periods may become shorter in order to cope the extension of time. Events that have a possibility of occurring throughout the day can be unintentionally imposing and certain situations may very well be perceived by an array of people as impossible to conclude with the aforementioned extension. A final note pertaining to the topic is that a longer daily routine may lead to extensive conflict with faculty, student, guardian time frames. Students can have extracurricular activities that can require adequate time to function properly such as baseball and/or team swimming. The parents and guardians of the students may now not have time to fulfill their career schedules in order to react with their children and could result in negative consequences. Faculty members may have to stay a longer duration to cleanse or conclude their occupational duties because of the excess of materials and activities. The people apparent within the school and to some degree outside of it could be left with the severe imbalance of two correlating but differed schedules they must interact with. Though a multitude of negative concepts and events may be associated with the topic of extending the day, there are quite in fact a variety of benefits to such a transformation. A prolonged schedule can be excellent for the further study of a subject as well as direct application. Homework can have a higher chance of being finished within school hours. Socialization in lunch and gym sessions could be extended. However, negative concepts can still be present with the solutions, which may indicate that no matter what may be of the scenario, unproductive elements can still remain. As previously mentioned, I take a view that is against the prolongment of the academic schedule as it relates to incompatibilities for multiple individuals, an increase in negativity, and the current time frame and activities of school. Once again, parents and guardians may have to reduce time at their positions in order to cope with shift of schedule. Homework and subject directives may become more significant in amount and requirement, perhaps stressing the students and teachers to quite the degree. The current schedule alone has multitudes of events, activities, and concepts that are brimming in attentiveness and consumption. Benefits and negatives of the school lengthening its duration are and can be present, but truly take into consideration what a change in a time frame could result in; its impacts can be irreversibly.

51,366,73234AB62383,"Would you wanna be extending 2 more hour to your school schedule because you work for four days for 10 hours? In my opinion I feel like no because sometimes some students decide they want to spend some time with their family . Also some students have to go home early and do something else instead of doing their school work and some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Some students decide they want to spend sometime with their family. Some students decide that because sometimes they might not have enough time with some one that lives far from them so they decide they want to go where they live and they want to be with them before they leave. Also some students might want to spend more time with there grandparents because they might not be able to see them or they either want to spend more time with there grandparents because they want to help them out side there in the stages of being old so they might need help with something. Also some students might want to hang out with their cousins since they might not have seen them for awhile. Student usually like to spend a lot of time with there family since they might not have seen them for years so they decide they want to spend more time with them . Some students have to go home early and they have to go do something else instead of doing their work from school. Instead of doing their school work some students have to go after school to go sports so they might not have time to stay in school for 10 hours because they might have to be going to their practice whens school finishes. Some students might have to go straight home because they might have to go babysit their little siblings since there parents are working. Some student might have to go home early because they might have to go straight to work or they might get in trouble if they dont go at the time they tell them they could get into trouble. Students usually have to go do something else instead of having to go do their school work all day. Some students have to enjoy their free time instead of working all day. Instead of staying at school all day or at work all day students decide to go out and hang out with their friends. Some students might want to go out and go shopping .Some student decide to go out and spend some time with their parents since they dont have that much time .Also some student just want to enjoy the only time they are free to do something instead of being stuck at school all day or being stuck at work all day. In my opinion I feel like we shouldnt add more hours to out school schedule because at this time we are still young and we want to enjoy the free time that we have before we get older because then we wont be having that much time left since we will mostly be in school still or might just be working all day. Also I feel like some people might just be getting tired of all the work they give us to the point were some students might just give up on there work. For example when I get out of school I usually have to go home and take care of my little sister because my mom cant . I wouldnt like to be stuck in school for another two more hours because I would have to be leaving school late and if I had a four day work week I would not be able to do my school work at home , When I would get home from work I would be really tired and just decide to fall asleep.",7,8,8,8,8,9,1492,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
52,1701,7680EF5AD3CB,"I believe students should not be required to take a music, a drama, or an art class. Therefore, it should be an elective. Not every student is excellent in the same things. However, taking a required class a student may not desire or need in the future can cause a student to fail. I believe students should not be required to take any of those classes because its pointless, unfair, and not important. To begin with, it should be an elective because not every student will need any of those classes to become a succesful person. Other students may want something dissimilar for their future that has nothing to do with singing, art or drama. Its also not helping a student to become smarter or to learn more. Its no where near educational related. It wouldnt be entertaining for students who do not want to take the class. The second reason I certainly believe it is unfair to make it a requirement because it can cause them to fail and hold them back from graduating. It also shouldnt be a class that should hold you back from moving forward on to college. Students would feel as if it were a pathetic reason for them to repeat a grade over a class that is useless. In conclusion, I believe that it should not be required classes to take. its not important for students to take any of those classes. Its not a class that will help or provide a student to get a job. Majority jobs dont require for you to have any of those classes. ",7,7,6,8,8,7,1543,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
53,159,30A7E68EFC88,My position is this argument is that behind every success there is a failure. Its important to understand that failure is not something bad its just something in the way of your success. These are my opinion on what i thing about. these paragraphs that you are about to look at have a mixer of things from hard working to failure just a little background of what you are about to read. Starting a company can be really hard because there are a lot of failure that youll have to go through to get to success. Because you wont be a big company from the start you have to built up to have a big company. For example the company apple it started in a garage and now its one of the biggest company to be know. Failure is just something thats in the way of you becoming successful. Because what it takes is hard work that you need to put into your company or whatever you are trying to be successful at. If not someone else thats trying to get the some thing as you will get it before you. Because you did not work hard enough Becoming successful in something is a hard thing. Because of other people can be trying to do the same thing you are trying to do and sometimes not everyone is successful because of someone else that worked hard then them of the successes. Being the best at what you do is difficult because people are going to bring you down those are failure because they hate on your successes and what you have accomplished. Working hard on something that you on youll be successful in because if not other people that are on the same race as you trying to be successful are working more harder then you are going to be more successful because of the hard work they put in. If you are starting a company try to be the best at what you are doing because thats the only way youll be successful because you are the best at what you are doing and no one else cant beat you to the top. My position is this argument is that behind every success there is a failure. Its important to understand that failure is not something bad its just something in the way of your success.

I feel when people say that, is because they know technology effect peoples lives. This are some reasons how technolohy can effect peoples live or human contac. Peolple be adictive with their phones, They can be adictive with shopping online, and dont have communication with other people. The people is adictive with his phone or the game, in my opinion is bad because they just thinks in his self. For example, if someone need help he or she can help the person because, he or she are used the phone and sometimes mean, their phone or the game is more important that someone need help. That person can be a adult or a child. Sometimes we need to be more kind an have a good heart with other people. I know is you are woman, you always shop online that is the best thing make womans. but some of woman have addiction with shop online.

55,1342,161779A176BD,"Many people argue about how there shouldnt be a long summer break because students do not retain information as easily when they return in the fall. But I do not agree to this argument , because I know that having a long break makes students accomplish more things in life. For example There is many students that have not seen one of their family members in a long time and most of them dont have that time to even say hi to them and why? well because sometimes the schools do not provide a longer breaks and they are so busy trying to focus on school work and get everything done on time that they forget even on their own name. In reality not everyone is going to have things planned for summer break. Theres still students that prefer making their vacation useful. They make they time valuable by taking classes online. And the reason to this is that they might want to graduate early so that they get out of school and maybe have more time to think about their future and what they want to study in college. For me this is a great opportunity to manage time and use it correctly. But even though not all students prefer doing it they still succeed in school and they will accomplish too. Educators say that students are more likely to forget information that they have learned in school after they come back from their good time. And the answer to this is yes thats true but that doesnt mean that all the information goes to waste, because thats why there is technology to help us remember things that we might have forgotten and also their is still teachers that can answer our questions if we have some. And not only the teachers can help, there is so many things were we could get information from like going to the library, asking a friend, asking a teacher , dictionary , and the internet. Another example is that after coming from summer break some students also feel relief because they didnt worried about having to turn in school work or an assignment being late, the main thing that a lot of students hate is, waking up so early and being stressed . But with a vacation they could save some energy they could sleep more and they can relax and enjoy their break. For me personally I dont really like waking up in the morning because of how tired I am with so many assignments that I am not able to rest as much. Sometimes I even fall asleep and wish to get a break from school because I feel so weak and I feel like my brain is going to explode if I do not get a break and thats only going to happened if you never get a break but if you do then you are ready to go and learn. Last but not least students are able to work during summer they could get a part time or a full time job. This would be so helpful for many students that have fees to pay to the school , or just in general. They could get a chance to pay for things that they might need in school and classes or they could work just to get some extra money. After summer break is over they can keep the job for only part time or they could go and focus again in school . To conclude I agree that having a 3-4 week break in the summer , a winter break and a week off spring and fall is the best idea. Because we are like cars if you put gas on them they will take you anywhere youd like but if you dont they will not move until you put gas in it. Same as us if we do not get breaks we will be tired everyday but if you do give us time to relax outside of school we will be more successful and we could accomplish more things. And this is why I believe having a longer break sounds a good idea. ",9,8,9,8,7,8,301,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
56,3275,0EC392C06372,"Introduction: Author Ralph Waldo Emerson ""Unless you try to do something, beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". One thing that is really important in life is School because is the second place that we learn about how we can be respectful, responsible, honest and education. The second thing is Work- Independent because when we are always with our family is simple because we dont know how is the reality in the life. We were dependent but work include be prepare to have new experiences in our personal life and we are prepare to the future. The third thing is Life Cycle when we are baby, kids, teenagers, adults and older. The first is School (experiences) In our life school is important because teachers educate we and we learn of them about the classes like english when we travel to any country that speak this language we need to learn by process every day inside and outside the class because we improve with new topics like verbs, punctuation marks in school porcess. Teachers teach good values in our life like integrity, respectful, honest, responsible, service. For example, when we start to study we dont know how to write, read, paint, speak. They teach we everything like our parents at home. We decide when we grow up if we want graduate from the school,those values efforts, dedication, knowledge, good skills and new opportunities if we do everything correct inside and outside the school because we cant stop growing the opportunites that we can have is only one time in the life. Education is very important now in the present because if we go to school we are professionals and we can have good choices. Second is Work being independent in the life our parents work all the time because they want that we can have a good life, but when we go to work is interesting for example when we continue going to the school our parents cant give money all the time and we think like adults being independent, finding a job and learn about the life not is simple and is hard at the same time. Our future dependent if we want to think like adults or teenagers. We can be master helping other people that need our help those people will grateful with we because if we try to help each other we know everything from life experiences, when we go to school they pay better with a diploma from High School, College or University. Finally is Life Cycle when we are babies our parents teach we every process for example how to go to the restroom, brush our tooth, take a shower, speak, walk, eat for example when is the time for go to the dinning room. The time when we need go to sleep is relly important learn every little thing that our parents teach we when we are baby. We discovere a new stair that already we can be mastered. Kids for example after when we were baby in a simple thing we discovered new things, but being kids we continue in a easy way the life like speak, walk, eat, sleep, change our clothe not is difficult because we learn in the past, we try to do something beyond that we dont know before. Teenagers when we think that the life is hard going to the school, work, family, not is easy because is more responsability, efforts being stronger and continue doing those things is very different from the past. Adults is more difficult when we were baby, kids and teenagers because adults are charge of the family, work, pay, education, responsabilitys in the job and home. Adults are dependent because they learn the good things from the past for example when teenager want permission for go to any party adults really need to know what person is, where is from, the personality and who is her/his family, in any moment like that is really difficult to say yes or no. Adults are important in the society because they are master and grow from the Life Cycle. Older like grandmother and father they already know that grow not is easy but they did every step in a good form going the school, work - independent. Old people in sometimes need help from younger people like the family can be sister, brother, son, wife and daughter because they are tired and need space to relax like going to the park sharing with his/her family and friends. In this last thing if we try something different we can have a positive life. In conclusion: We can try being a better person in our life because every step is very important maybe in sometimes life is hard but if we learn in a correctly form everything like going to the school is a new experience, work - independent teach we being stronger and not be afraid, life cycle is the process from every step when we were baby, kids, teenagers, adultd and older. We grow every moment that can be easy or difficult. We need to be dependent to grow up, master everything helping other people in the world. I agree with the author because I know if we stop growing is very impossible to have new experiences in our life. Unless we try to do something different and intersting in our life we can a better chance to do good things can be in the present or in the future, for the new generation that can have good opportunities in school, job and with the society.

58,3546,A2C232F3D92C,"Are you happy with your self? Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" Do you agree or disagree with this statement? I agree with this statement, being yourself and not letting people change you is a great accomplishment. One should never allow someone to change you. To be yourself is the best way to the greatest accomplishment because people try to persuade you or talk to you about doing something else that doesnt impressed you. You have to actually think about what you actually want to do to accomplish in life. You dont have to listen to what other people say and tell you. Most of the time people gives wrong advice to others. You have to believe in yourself, that you can accomplish greater thing just doing what you admire. Go with what you think its a good decision for you, either being by yourself or need someone to tell you what to do. Most of time people doubt others. Having a strong feeling that being by yourself is a good decision for you, that a good thing because thats means you have no problems of being by yourself. If you know that you going to succeed in life then that amazing because you believe in yourself . Go with that decision that you think is right and dont allow nobody to make you do something that you dont think is wrong. However, there are people who think allowing someone to change you can be an accomplishment. Only if it is for the good. For example, if someone is having a hard time being a good citizen and they are always getting into trouble, then yes changing them is a good thing. You can help them out by saying "" what you doing is not a great decision, you should have better choices then getting into trouble."" Another example, is if someone is having a difficult time, you could help them by giving them good advice how to accomplish something. Being yourself lead to great accomplishment. I agree with this statement. Sometime people try to change you because they thought you couldnt succeed with what you wanted to become or wanted to accomplish. Sometimes being yourself doesnt goes as plan as you thought it going to go. In my decision being yourself and actually knowing what to do is the best decision to the greatest accomplishment.

59,3734,B948405746B5,"Many students like to spend time with their friends in the school. Specially high schools are good places for students to learn and get fun with their friends. By the way some students are coming to school just for the pass their classes and work hard to graduate with high grades. I think graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years from a high school would be good for these students. Because they can go to college/university early, or work 1 year full time in a job to save money after graduated from high school or get more time to think about their career desicion. First of all a student who graduated from high school in three years can attend to a college early. This means this student also can graduate one year early from the college and start his career early. If this student already decided to which college or university that he wants to go and what career he wants to do, this can be good for him. Also, student can understand how college classes are. Second reason for to choose graduate early is save money for college/university. Some students who graduated from high school dont go to college/university directly. These students choose to work in a job one or two years full time to save money for college/university. This is a good option for the students who doesnt have money to pay for college/university or who doesnt want to be dependent to his family. Some families dont have money to pay their childrens school. In this kind of situations students choose to wait one or two years instead of go to college/university directly. Another reason to graduate early from high school is to get a extra year to make a desicion about career and college/university. Some students think it is hard to choose the right career for them in high school because when they graduateded from university their careers is going to be their whole life. Like an example sometimes students choose the job according to the classes that they liked in their high school but after they go to college/university they understand this career is not interesting more to them. According to the scientistists 35% of the college/university students decide to change their career in their freshman or sophomore year in the university. This shows that students need to think carefully while they make a decision about their careers. Also the career that a student choose effects the college/university that he wants to go because many students choose the university that gives good education and opportunites to this students about their careers that they choosed. In conclusion I think graduate one year early from high school is a good idea for the students who wants to go to college/university early. Another reason is save money to pay college/university and final reason is to get a extra time to make a desicion about right career and school. I believe also to study and get prepared better for SAT to get a higher score can be an extra reason. Graduate early from high school is a good idea but also can be hard for all students.

61,376,0B953049AE1E,"Some school districts offer programs that allow allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I think students should be offered the opportunity to graduate in three years so they can go to college or join the work force early. A program that offers you three years of high school has so many benefits and advantages. Its a great option, because who doesnt want to be done with high school one year early and come out ready to pursue their career or dream? Its not only about finishing school early, but in that year you also have the advantage to be offered jobs or be hired over somebody else for example, if you were competing for a job in fixing computers you would have the more experience, knowledge, and advanced while the other guy just came out of high school and is new to the work force. This program gives you the option to have a flexible schedule and to choose whats best for your comfort. Taking courses over the summer and not being able to take electives can help you finish more early and to be available to plans for the future. You will have so much time to invest in activities that your interested or visit colleges you wish to go to, because remember your graduating early and you have to be ready for this life changing experience. Having an extra year of high school is waste not just of your time but a waste of your life!

62,2137,A9290F062546,"I believe, what Thomas Jefferson wrote about "" determine never to be elder "" because we would never know how can we impact on someone life or in our life. never say never , dont stop doing what you love, just because some people wont appreciated your work. Two example why no to stop doing you, you could make people happy, people could also learn how to become better on someones life, and even you never give up, just do you and you will see the result at the end. First of all, Its amazing how much may be done if you always doing something. Every minute, hours, seconds, and days is important, because we can do a lot in like 10 min. Stop thinking to much dont wasted. I always like to keep my self busy. Specially if is about soccer. Take care of your self, your body needs energy, fun things to do, so that way you and your brain dont feel irritating. Personally, like 10 years ago my cousin die because hes girlfriend didnt want to with him, for the fact that he only thing he could do was using drugs and nothing appropriated., we found him on a tree. In addition, this is why dont stop doing something. Who knows probably a girl/ guy could fall in love with you, or you could also make people feel strong for whatever situation you could be you will see the result at the end. Keep doing what the people with illness do, never give up, they always have an smile on their face. Even people famous they kill their self because they feel alone, because they dont interact with the community, or with fun people that could make their life happy and easier.

Personally I dont waste time, I keep doing me, I am always doing something for example, school , work and I also play soccer for the Generic_City recreation soccer.

63,1777,7B0430EDACBA,"I agree that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life. I believe is important to have a positive attitude because having a positive attitude can open doors to different phase in life. For example, when it comes to school, significant others and obstacles that life may throw at us. Is important to not loose our cool and have the type of attitude that everything is going to turn out great at the end of the day. Having a positive attitude when it come to school can be a way to cope with all your assignments, teachers and schoolmates. Especially being a teenager people thing is not difficult to wake up every morning 6 or 7 AM and deal with peoples attitude and also having to worry about the amount of work the teachers give out to students and then going home to do chorus is something that teenager are capable of doing, but adults dont take that time to think that they was teens back in the 60s where life isnt easy but when it comes to school rules have change. Now we must pass SOLs to graduate but, a person who stays positive believes in there self makes it easy for their self to get through whats stop you from being happy. Everyone in life have to deal with different types of obstacles physically and mentally. For example when i came to America I thought my life was over learning a whole different language and also trying to adapt to whole new country a whole different environment would be hard for me. Instead of being hard head i stayed positive learn English really fast and started to start feeling more comfortable in America. I also was thinking of families back home and how i cant let them down, because they would love an opportunity like this to have a free education and being able to make it to the 12 grade. We all go through so much and the only way to get through is having a positive attitude that things well turn out better than yesterday. Others would say that you dont have to have a positive attitude in life to be successful because they probably dont have self confidence, someone around to give them hope or have giving up on their self to many times. I believe that having a positive attitude is the key to being successful in life because you viewing life on a whole other level all you see is good things coming your way and the nothing can get in between of your dreams and if you was to fall you going to pick yourself right back up and start again. In conclusion being able to wake up every morning and thank God for another day and pray that things are going to turn out better than yesterday is an important skill to have in this world we call life. We all have them phase that we go through and we feel like we cant keep moving forward but why stand in the same place with that same negative attitude is going to prevent you from wanting or doing more.

For Example,Paul George,and the Clippers played against Los Angeles Lakers,during the middle of the game Pauls shots werent falling so he was having a low scoring game,but he still tried his best to get rebounds and steals to win the game for his team. For another Example Generic_Name had a test,and there were some questions on there that he didnt understand. so he still worked through the problems,and took an educated guess and still tried his best and got a 75 on the test. usually Generic_Name get a B or above on tests but he forgot that the teacher told him that there would be some questions on the test that the class didnt know. Final Example,my little sister is a basketball player like me and every Friday i go to ball handling to get my handles right. My little sister never done it before,and the class that we took was advance,it was easy for me because i been doing it for so long. But,i look to my right and i seen my sister struggling and my Trainer told her she was doing it wrong. So she dropped the ball and walked out the gym. After the training we got home,and i had a talk with her,and i told her i was gonna help her out. I showed her the moves outback and she started to get the hang of it,and now shes been practicing on the moves for weeks,and finally uses them in the game. But, she gave up the first time but, she was willing to try,and the results turned out fine because she tried her best. You should always want to do your best and not give up because if you do your best the turn out would be great. It makes you want to work hard and do better at the things you want to do or get the things that you like. It makes you feel good because you know you tried to give it your all and wouldnt have to stress about it.",7,6,7,5,7,6,2359,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Getting advice from many people can help you get a different perspective, it can help you in the future,and it can help the community. Having a different perspective is really good . When you have a different perspective of something you might have a better adtuided . Lets say you fail a test and you have a really bad adtuided and you asked many people what could you do to help and what they say can make you feel better which causes you to have a better a adtuided. Having different perspective also gives you different opinion. I believe that having different opinions is something you should always consider because you most likely will hear the same thing and you might like what they say but you might hear something different and you might like it even more. Having a different perspective can not only give the situation a better perspective but it can also give you a different perspective. Hear me out not only can other peoples perspective give the situation a different point of view but yourself as well. I believe that having advice from many people can really help you have a better perspective, adtuided,and understanding. Advice from more then one person can help your future. As you grow up you will release that you start to ask for more and more advice. I think the more you ask for advice the more you are most likely to be successful in your future. Advice that is given to you now will help you your whole life. For example my teacher once told me that not understanding how to do something is okay because from that is how we learn from it. The advice given to you is something you will pass down . I think that its amazing how much advice form who know how long ago has come so far. Advice can help you in the future by developing more and more,remembering it though your life,and pass it on to other generations. Advice also helps the community. It is proven that when advice is given the community becomes better. I believe that the community can become better when given advice. Part of becoming a better community is teaching others how they can become better. I think that this can be done with giving others advice. When advice is spread form person to person it spreads form community to community and then it spreads from state tot state and eventually the world. Advice needs to be spread all over the world and to make all our communities a better place. Advice can not only impact the community but the world as well Asking for opinions from more then one person can help you see different opinions,help you later in life, and help the world. Advice can help to see different points of view, help you in your ,and help our community become better. In conclusion I believe that getting advice can help having different perspective and help the community.

66,2279,CD5F70E5C1D7,"To begin with, in my opinion i think students and parents should get the choice to be involved in any type of extracurricular activties. and why im saying this is because the school does not have no right to tell you you can do this and that but if they ask you to stay to finish some school asignments or afterschool studying then i suggest you stay after if you really want to finish those assignments and get a good or decent grade on it. or if you want to do great in school or in any job and you need a lot of school for that type of job then you might want to do as much of extracurricular activites. Second of all, if the parents dont think that you are going to do good enough in school after the extracurricular activites and if you dont have enough time for study sessions or you homework because your to tired from sports such as football, basketball, lacrosse, and soccer. then ask your teacher or whoever is controlling the activties and ask them if you can get off a little earlier because you dont have enough time for homework, studying, or FAMILY or for yourself or your friends. but i think the school should give the students and thier faimly diffrent choices of extracurricular activties so the students can pick 2 or 3 diffrent types of them instead of not having time for thier own life. like the students can pick and choose the 2 or 3 they really want or like to do or they can pick the ones thats going to help them the most in the future of school or in thier adult life, because teachers can teach the students things from extracurricular activites that they learned or did so they wont have to ask no one else for help or hire somebody then from that you can save money and you can also get money if you help someone that doesnt know how to do that type of thing. And thats why i think it should be the students and parents choice if the students want to or not do extracurricular activities. because the school doesnt think about the students family or what they got going on at that time they just want to boss the kids around and tell the students to go ot not go.",6,7,7,7,7,6,2812,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

Also students who take this program they could take classes for the same subject like, English nine and English teen at the same year. However students who take this program and they are going to college they could finish more early college and students who not going to college they can start working more early. But students who take this program are more exposed to fail or give up for the rush time that is in the programs and regular school years don`t have that problem.

For this very reason, being home schooled and having online courses gives you the chance to have more time to do your work, reevaluate, and overall to take as long as you may need, and whats important is feeling comfortable and moving at your own pace. Although, some may take this as an advantage or opportunity to try and fit in extracurricular activities and or to try and learn new things because maybe they want to pursue something different that needs more time of something and less time of a seven hour education course that restricts them of doing so because school takes up almost of half of the time in their every day life. Online classes can often help people but make it harder for other people to learn, sometimes youll need a buddy to help out or youll need a teacher to ask questions to learn but people may take online courses because they feel that they can work better alone rather than to be working with others and thats where they could be in the wrong. Youre not always going to know everything, you have to give yourself the chance to open up and have the opportunity so that you could expand your knowledge of education, theres a point in time where youve got to say ask a classmate or teacher for help, and Im not speaking on the behalf of everyone but thats how people are, they think they can learn everything there is to know about something but youve got to take a step back and know when to say hey and say these five simple words and that is, ""may I get help please"". Therefore I do Indeed agree that taking online classes is a great way to benefit off of beacause people may feel that they can work on their own and move at their own pace and overall just have an amazing experience at the end of the day.

It is tired and hard to help other people, but assist make people glad. My ability is I can speak Korean, acquired Korean by reading the books, can use my skill usefully by teaching Korean to Korean - American and communicate and help Korean. I developed my Korean skill by reading books often. I read a Korean book at least in a week. Mostly, it was hard to understand and I had to find the words meaning in every single time. However, I could improve my writing skills, vocabulary skill and I could speak Korean and write logically. For example, I took World Language Exam last year, I could use the words that I saw when I was reading a book. Also, I could make my writing clearly, organize and I understood prompt very well. In addition, my parents read Korean books to me and my brother. That made me to understand and speak in Korean fluently. I can use Korean skill very usefully by teaching Korean to Korean- American. Usually, people who were born in America but their families are Korean, and they dont know how to write, speak and write in Korean. For example, I go to the church every Saturday and help to teach Korean to the teenagers or children. It is hard but they can learn Korean from Korean school and communicate with families. For example, they become teenagers, and they can speak only English and their parents can speak only Korean. They will not able to communicate each other. They will become farther. Nevertheless, teenagers can ignore their parents that they cannot speak English. Communicate with Korean can be useful because some Korean are immigrated to America with not enough English skills. They need help with bills, housing and information of America. If you go any stores or community center, they are having difficult because they cant speak English so they cannot understand what the owner is trying to say. If you can speak Korean, you can help them. For example, I was student ambassador which is help new students to touring the school and help them with the schedule. The new student came to our school and she was Korean and she cannot speak English. I introduce the school, and class schedule in Korean to her so she can understand about school system. There are lots of advantages if you speak another languages. You can acquire Korean by reading books that help to improve your writing, reading, vocabulary skills.

74,1084,F610C7BCD9EC,"Technology seems to be becoming more and more important now. As the technology improves year by year, some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. But people have very different thoughts to this idea, then the problem comes. Would students benefit from being able to attend classes from home? Although some think students should attend classes from home, actually they shouldnt attend classes from home because students might be doing other things during the online class time. And students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends if they attend classes from home. Those who believe students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home have their reasons. They think its much safer for students to take an online class at home. And they also believe it might be better for students to study under a quite environment. One reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that they might be doing other things during the online class time. An example of this would be my cousin, Generic_Name. He took an online class on the computer few months ago. In the beginning, he was so exciting because it was the first time for him to take a class at home. And his parents were happy to see that because its difficult to send Generic_Name to school everyday, both of them had work to do. After a few weeks, Generic_Name got his first test grade of online study. It was much lower than the grade he used to get. I asked the reason later, he explained he was playing his cell phone during the class time and didnt pay attention. If he normally took classes in the school, I thought he would get at least a ""B"" in this test. He was smart,just too lazy to study. Its undeniable that online classes brought a lot of convinces to Generic_Name and his family, but it was not the best way to help him to improve his grade. Another reason of why students shouldnt attend classes from home is that students would get less opportunities to communicate with their friends. An example of this would be my friend, Generic_Name. Although he wasnt like to talk, he had a lot of friends in the school because he was nice to everyone. But everything has changed, since he attended classes from home . We didnt see him for a long time even the class was over. His parents told us he wont come to school anymore because he hated school. If Generic_Name took classes at school like before, he would meet more friends. I cant say if its a bad choice to attend classes from home, but at least not the way for those students who wasnt like to talk. In conclusion, although some think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home, I believe students shouldnt attend classes from home. They should get more opportunities to communicate with their friends, and enjoy their short, but wonderful school life.

75,1384,6867A6767D25,"An enjoyable educational activity is Avid for anyone that has a dream they want to achieve. The first reason why I say this is because this activity is not only to help you become a better person but also to encourage you to go to college . Secondly They give you tutorials not only to see where your at but to help you improve in any class . In addition you also get the opportunity to go on beautiful fun field trips. Lastly Its like saying you have another family no matter where you go. In Avid you learn to become a responsible and hard working person in a way that you have a binder check every week to stay organized. Its like another class but in Avid we all have a dream that we all want to achieve in which we know we have to keep trying and theres no giving up in till we accomplish it. College is something not everyone is looking forward to as a teenager but some of us are, but if we start hanging around with the bad types of people it can drag us to the deepest part of an ocean in other words theres no coming back up to where you use to be. Not saying you shouldnt be friends with that type of people I mean you can but in my perspective dont get involved as much as your other friends is. Secondly tutorials are a big part of Avid it shows your teachers and peers around you how much you know and how strong you are and the effort you but into a tutorials to get in front of the group and explain what you are having problems with but also helps you learn from your peers and its like sharing the brain cells. Tutorials in other words shows your personality in a way when your not a shy person to go in front of your group and talk some people dont like that they like keeping them self in a inner circle talking less but listening to the tutorials. In addition you get field trips which most middle schools or high schools students dont have that opportunity you get to visit colleges and learn about them it helps you know more about colleges and also having fun by walking around with a person guiding you to where you should go plus you get to meet knew people once your there. Its just a very cool opportunity you have to be able to do things not all students are allowed to do. One of the most funnest and amazing things the Avid activity has is we do fundraisers to raise money to go to Kings Dominion and once your there you well be like Ive earned this because for example your working hard and your not doing nothing fun like whats gonna make you keep doing that like even is you wanted to be someone in life your gonna work as hard as you can without looking down because you have something thats giving you the support and keeping you strong. In my point of view Im working hard and something that encourages me to do better is my niece. The Avid activity is basically kinda the same you work hard doing tutorials and making coneal notes and at the end of the year you get to go and have fun with friends and ride roller coasters its just a really fun thing to do. Avid for me and any other students I think would agree Avid is a family we do something everyone agrees and everyone has fun with it to no one talks bad about anyone and even thought we all come from different places around the world no one is mean to one another we all stay together we all learn the something if one the Avid students want to give up we make sure they dont because were a family and something we always say when were down is dream, believe, achieve . This activity helps you and school but also knowing your making your self proud but also youre parents and family . In conclusion the reason why I think this activity is enjoyable is because your getting to meet knew people and you never know you would find you own best friend there. You get to do cool activities and join programs. Also its like a family so if you have a family that doesnt really care about you Avid can cover that in a way you can be your self and you dont have to pretend to be anyone else. Its just a big opportunity you get to be in it you should be a risk taker because once you are you never know it can lead you to a positive direction you can become a great person and become someone in life.

Students dont have to wake up early in the mornings and be tried and if Students come to school all tried they wont do the work most of the time. If the Students take online classes then can finish anytime without have to worried about the class finishing and not hand in an incomplete assignment. This way if students are really sick and cant come to school and are going to be out of school for weeks then this will help the students keep on track with the class. If the schools did the online classes they wont have to be worried about snow days. A other benefit is being at home everyday and not have to move around a lot. Students would focus more because they have no one to talk to during the online classes. A other reasons this is good is that students that dont come to school a lot can stay at home while they can do the school work at home instead of go to school and not showing up. Students would probably have better grades because they would be finishing the work. It would be easy the get help if the students dont understand they can just search it up on the internet or ask someone in their house for some help. The students can take brakes during this time so they dont tried of doing a lot of work. This can also help the students with computer skill while doing online school. Students would get better information while doing this and it will come a long way in the future for them. A other good reason is that the students can show their mom or dad they did their work so they can do what ever they went after because most of time students dont show their mom or dad that they have been doing work in school. This would make somethings easier for people like the people who dont like to come to school or the people who dont like to wake up early in the morning.

There is a debate between people who thinks should people more accomplish then inactive. Some people believes their journal will take them to their destiny and they doesnt have to accomplish any thing. It doesnt matter for some people to make decisions and others think different. Because they think their destiny will take them to where they should be. In other hands, I believe what Thomas Jefferson said, ""Determine never to be idle...It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" This quote shows me why we have to make our decision so fast and not let to wait. Because we dont know what will happen in the future. We have to being more active, so it will help the country economy. When we are active the country rules and powers can change. Being active is optimal for immigrants too because it help them to learn new language. People always have to take life seriously because how they will know there will be a tomorrow. We should try to make decision before our destiny makes one for us. First, when people are more active by working hard it help the economy of a country. Many people accomplish succeed by working hard in difficult environment and it is beneficial for a country to have some excellent active workers. By accomplishing more succeed in your job they can rise your salary. In other jobs they always honor those who are working so hard. Its less chance to be loser. To find sussed everything basically inside your hand. When people accomplish more is not just for their beneficial it is for their country too. Second, In the past women didnt have any rights in to the government until ninetieth amendments. Before women were inactive and that leave them behind, but after while they start having job in the government branch by protecting their rights. When women start being active it help them to accomplish more success. In America women are having more rights than any other country because they were fight for their freedom. In my own country which is Generic_City, women are afraid of men because women are not active and they never try to having voice in public. Still today men are making decisions for the women and treat them like a slave person, Some female from my country try to being active to make a differences in my country. Third, some of immigrants try to be an active in their life by moving into another country. For immigrants it doesnt matter to accomplish more or not they just want a basic life. When my mom made the decision to move to the United State I was afraid to learn English and my mom use to tell me you can do it if you really wants to learn. When I first start school in U.S I was so nervous about how can I introduce my self to the teacher because I wasnt able to say hello even in English, but I trust my mom and everything changed. Finally, I get the success and that makes me really happy. In conclusion, we all will find the success by working hard and not let anything make feel us failure. By accomplish more you will be succeed just dont lose your self. Be hard work and an active person is better than acting like loser. When people inactive they always behind of others and their life is meaning less. People should always accomplish more because there should be a line between who wants win and who wants lose.

78,3502,F0BB52DD1DB6,"I strongly agree with this statement that author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because i can relate to it based on my passed experiences as a little kid not wanting to try new things in life like other food and activities. I did not like to try new things as a kid because when i would fail at them i would get mad or upset. But i ended up trying new things in life anyways and it helped change my mindset from not pushing myself to believing in myself that i could accomplish things and also help me grow as a person. For example when i was l lot younger then i am today like a lot of kids i did not like to try new food. I was that type of kid that just did not like to try new thing at all. Say if i did not know what it was or had not try in before in the past i did not want it at all. Some times my mom would tell me to eat my food or she would not let me go outside or take me to the park to play. so i would eat it but not because i wanted to it was because i wanted to go play outside or go to the park because i was just full of energy all the time and always liked to be outside. Thinking back to those memories at least the ones that i can remember i always seem to get easily upset. When i did not know how to do something that other kids or people knew and could do. I would throw a fit you could say sometimes and not want to be a part of the activity at all and just straight up get mad over simplest things that just needed some time put towards them. So i could learn them or master them or someone that could have taught them to me. I think if i wouldnt have gave up on some things when i was younger i would have know how to do a lot more then i can today. Instead of just watching the other people do this type of activities and enjoy themselves. I always wanted to know how to play these sports as a kid. Like know how to play soccer,football,and play basketball. Instead i would give up on myself on the first time i failed at it. But as time went by and the older i got little by little i started to try new things in life besides just other foods. I think the reason for this was that my mindset was changing and i did not give up on myself anymore i started to push myself to achieve my goals. I learn that anger would help me too like this one time in middle school i was in my math class my teacher said that i could not solve the problem that he had put on the board because i did not pay attention in class. So i got mad and did my best to solve him and show him that i could solve that problem and i did after class he came up to me and told me that he was proud and that he knew i could do it cause when someone tells me i can not i get mad and work hard to prove them wrong. He also told me to never let what other people say stop me from achieving my goals in life and to also try to control my anger. I understand that know because i know there people who look out for you and help you. But also there are lots of people that do not want to see you make it in life and do better then them. This is why i strongly agree with this author by the name Ralph Waldo Emerson and his statement. That go by the lines of unless you try to do something that you have never done before you will never grow. Its just how some people play it safe in life and do not attempt to do or try scary things in there life like rock climbing,sky diving swimming with sharks sneaking into abandon house cause its haunted by a ghost or something not like other people who live their lives with no fear. You can be scared i life but do not let them fears keep you from having fun and enjoying life.",6,8,8,7,6,6,3543,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 6"
79,1749,F4BEEA034AA5,"When you try something that already you have do, and that thing didnt work, dont be worry about that because than more time yourre trying to do it you will get more strong and have control by your self, always keep strong and keep the calm, and belief that youll be a great person and all the doors will be open for you. Trying new things helps you to understand that you can do more things,everything depends on you if you really wants to do something that you like, just do it , never do the opinions of others people because is only you, the people cant control you life everything. The thing that you already done and you was doing and everything was wrong,what the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote is not right because doing something that you already done but you didnt get it thats doesnt mean that you life is done or you will never grow thats wrong, when youre sure that what you want youll be fairing for that thing that youll lose for many times but youll be fairing for that and youll not get tired until you get your dream. My father is a singer and hes very strong and he really know what he want, one day he participated on one big project about music, he was a really good singer but on the day of the presentation he completely lose his voice, but he won the presentation trying hes best , when he won many people tall him that they wanna to do a big different projects with him ,and now he is a big star and he grow a lot, that;s means that if you try something youll grow a lot because you have to belief and be very sure what you want and if see if you like, never give up just like me, when I came to United Estates I didnt speak any English and it was difficult to stay here and dont know any English all my homework and my project was difficult, but I didnt give up and im steel growing a lot and i have been trying a lot a things and I steel growing. Many people think that if youre so expert and mastered youll have a really good future , but some people think that the more time youre trying to do the think that you want youll miss time on your life because the only thing that its important to you is that think that you really want. Some people try a lot a things but if they didnt get and they fail and some of they stop what they wanted ,but some of them keep trying and trying their best to get what they want, always try your best and dont give up, when your families or friends tell you that you will not grow more or nothings dont belief that because yourre more strong that you know just keep doing and if youre a expert doing that thing you like youll grow a lot because you have to demonstrate to the people that who youre what you can do. steel faith for that and im not agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson is wrong just keep wronging and never stop everything depends on you.",4,4,5,5,5,5,3631,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
80,3751,54D835ADB326,"Everyday everbody try to do the best to live that day happy and try to make somebody also happy, for example when i was in Italy every year for the day of god everbody going to downtown and have some fun together like they drink,talk,eat and eat again, you can have some much fun there with no money the with money. This is important because you dont need money to be happy in your life just live your life with people the make you feel good and dont try to make you feel sad or bad. In your life Dont follow nobody and dont trust no one just your self. For example do somethiing the you like and you need think about the you are better the everyone because some people in this life are jealousy and something they can break you dream and you can not follow your dream because he say someting the make you sad or he do someting to you the you feel the with the thing the he did you can stop follow your dream. This is important because Dont live somebody also your life and dont make someone also control and tell you what you need to do with your life. Everyday I think about world can be if everyone are able or think to help the next youth. For example one day I was in Italy I was going to the super market with my dad and i think was my friend too with I dont know wherever, we going t obuy all the food the we need and when going to the register to pay what we buy I saw a guy try to buy a sandwich but he tell the register the only money the he have was $0.50 cent the sandwich was i think $2 then when i saw him turn the sandwich back to the register I take the sandwich and I buy for him, he was so happy and he tell me,"" My friend you make my day better"" i was so happy that day. This is important because you dont need spend a lot of money to make someone happy. In conclusion I think we are complish more when we always do something for somebody and I want say to everone the to live your life and never give up, because the time the you give up iss when you not trust your self anymore and thats is not a good thing.

81,449,E22F1FD54169,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow.""I disagree with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson because if you have already try to do something more than you have already mastered, You will grow because now days there is too much competition in everything for examples Companies,Schools and Sports etc. I think if you try to do something more than you have mastered will make you more better than you are because if you have mastered in something it will not be a bad idea to practice more even you know everything because everyday somebody is getting good by watching people those have mastered everything so when they go against them they will beat the master because they already know whats the master is going to do and they will try to protect themselves. Here are some examples when people play video games like fortnite people be watching streamers from YouTube and twitch to get better and learn some new moves and after watching them for some weeks they know what they are going to do next and how they going to play at any bad or good situation Here are some example like Apple is big company and Samsung is a big company they both have some bad relationships like Apple always make a good phone which is always better than Samsung but Samsung try their best to make a better phone than Apple so, Samsung has been trying to make better phones then Apple by trying to copy their features for examples the screen size, The GB, and motherboards. only reason Apple is making better phones because they have mastered everything and they are still making some new technology which Samsung might not able to make in next two or three years and here is a another example they are so many cars in the world for example Mercedes and Lamborghini they both are good cars Mercedes is a old company so they know everything about the car the way the want to make it luxury or fast and for example Mercedes is a fast and a luxury car where Lamborghini is a fast and luxury car, Here is a last example like your coach if you play sports you need a coach which is going to teach you how to play and teach some moves that you can use to beat your enemy and make you strong and tell how to dodge some stuff when they try to hit you for example people play boxing and for new people they hires coaches which help them to learn how to play and stuff. and teach you how to defend your self from getting hit on your face or hitting him back. The conclusion is yes, i disagreed with The Author Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote,""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" and you need to practice everyday dont matter how good your there is a lot of completion out there and some people dont even know there are so many people better than them which some people dont even know what kind of abilities they got. they need to go to gym and stuff to know hat kind of abilities they better in a moth year or days. and to get their mind working antler and help them to have a good mind and learn how to grow better and teach you guys to learn and thaknyou for grading my essay I love you from heart and have a nice day.

82,573,4B957C430005,"To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. I agree that it is the best thing to accomplishment because it makes that person become independent, helps you succeed and gain confidence, and gives you strength to help others out. In addition, being yourself helps you succeed through so much, it helps you become independent to take care of your own actions. Being independent is the best thing why?. Well because its better to accomplish your goals on your own instead of depending on another person you arent going to have that person always by your side. People come and go not really just any person sticks by your side like that. This is why doing things yourself, achieving your goal is the best thing, you can show people that you dont need any ones help because you got yourself and thats all you need. Also, being yourself motivates you to do better, you start to gain confidence and nothing is better than believing in yourself. Just how its easy to gain weight it is also easy to gain confidence by telling yourself I can do this!. By having motivation you can do possibly anything, you can jump off a plane if you have the guts to. You start doing better in school or your job perhaps, you start getting good grades or start coming to work on time. Motivation is key in order to succeed in life you must have confidence. In other words, once you start to gain confidence you need to have enough strength to help another person out perhaps they are depressed or its just not their best time right now. Motivate them to never give up no matter how much stress you have it shouldnt give you a reason to just stop trying. We have to go through the rough times first in order to have a better life. If someone or yourself is having a really harsh time dont be pressed over it the past is the past and many things happen for a reason. I have gone through a rough time myself for 6 months now but it never gave me a reason to give up I am a strong independent woman and I wont ever stop trying to stop having confidence. In conclusion, just how Author Waldo Emerson said To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment. He is correct but, also making you into something else could also mean in a negative but we always need to have a positive mindset. We must be independent and have confidence so we can succeed and so we can help others succeed as well to become somebody in life. Never give up just be positive and everything will come your way remember confidence and motivation is key.",7,7,7,6,8,7,987,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

I think that students should participate in one or more school extracurricular activity. here are some of my reason on why i think that student should participate in a school activity. I think that student should participate in a school activity because if you normally have noting do after school but just setting around waiting for something to happen, but if you were in any of the school sports you be wont be bored all the time anymore. school can make you meet new friends or get even better at the sport than you are now. sport can make you keep in good shape and good health. school clubs are really fun to do because you get to some really big project and activity but it also depends on what clubs you chose. like for example theres the FFA club , the FCCLA , the confetti club those club are really fun to do. you get to make new friends too if you waned to and when your in high school if you wanted to, you could run for school present for your school and make some changes to your school. after school activity like sport can school clubs can also be on your patent reared all out throw out high school and on to college and thats why i think that student should participate in one or more extracurricular activity.

84,346,65593BCE26BF,"Many schools have partnerships with local companies. It allow students to explore certain professions. Students needs a lot of stuff to success in life. Schools should have the qualities to help their students success. Schools should have a partnership business to help all the students to reach their goals. Helping the students to improve their skills and give them time to improve their brains as well. Having a partnership is much easier, because members helps when its needed. Partnership is easier, because if the business doesnt work out, then everyone will take the risk not only one person. Taking the risk alone is very hard, Its as hard as touching the clouds. Having all the risk alone is horrible, for an example it can causes living in the street or losing all the money that the person have. I want to live a good life when I grow up , so I wont like to take all the risk by myself. I dont want to lose all my money so I would be happy to have a partnership member to help me out. Plus Not working alone, I do not like to work alone in life. I would love to work with other people when I grow up. Sharing Is one thing I like about partnership. Its not only sharing the risks, but sharing the good stuff too. Sharing ideas to make the profit better. Sharing money to grow the business. Yes, sharing is a really good thing in a partnership business. Partnership is not about loneliness, but its about happiness. Working alone is really boring , but by talking to the members of the partnership can be really fun. By doing that the members gets to know each other much more. I believe that all is it about is trust and happiness. Some people might thinks that Partnership is not good. They believe that partnership business is not helpful at all, but they are wrong it is helpful. They think that the members might not get along with each other, and at the end the business will break down. Getting along with each other takes time, but picking the right people for the business is needed. People who thinks that partnership is bad they are actually wrong, but they have points though. Partnership is about learning new stuff from other people, and its the most important thing in a partnership business. A lot of schools now are having a partnership with local companies, which is a good thing. It will help students to improve their skills. It will also help the students to reach their goals and success in life. Plus having a partnership business is much easier, and No one takes the risk alone.

86,1241,B32F41984B27,Here is my three reason why student should not go online do the classes work at home. My first reasons:student should not do there classes from home. Because it can be hard doing you work at home it batter do the work at work because you can get help by the teacher at home no one can help you. It can be hard to do the work from online because you dont know what the teacher can gave to you i will rather do it at school because it will be easy to do the teacher can help you with it will be hard try to do you classes work online at home. My seconds reasons:student who are smart should do there classes online at home. Student who pass the SOL and the class they should get out early from school because people who have a job they should get out early from school. Student should have a high GPA so they can find a collage they want to be they have to think what they want to be when they finish high and collage so they can have there own business person and make money. People who is smart should not go to school because they already pass every they did. my third reasons:They should make classes work online only for the kids. Because it will be easy for them to do they classes work online. They should make classes online only for kid it will easy fro them do it it at home batter then school but some parents they want there kid to go to school and do the work at school. If they school do classes online for kid it will be easy for teacher and for the kid. My finial reason:For school offer classes online at home. I think all high school student should have classes online at home because it will be easy for student and for the teacher. If student have classes work online at home they can copy from his friends that why is not good to have classes online. Middle school should have a classes work online at home. summer: Collage should have online classes becuase it will easy for them do complete the classes online at home they will have time to do it and get a batter garde so you can complete the classes and take a new classes when you get A or B.,4,4,5,4,4,5,2412,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
87,1119,20BC5CCE8C64,"""SNORE, SNORE"" every time that I do something I do not I feel so lazy. I think if we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that your mind do not get lazy and you feel productive. For example, if you go to school, have a job, and help other people. If you do many things every time later on you always will want to do something. I also know that you can do something without doing nothing and one them is been at of problems. Like Thomas Jefferson wrote,"" never to be idle"" that means that do not be the type of people that do not like to do nothing. First, I believe if you go to school you will accomplish more because your mind is going to be busy. In my opinion, I feel that I do a lot more than just not do nothing because: I wake up on time ,I go to school every day, I do my homewoks after school, and I feel productive by going to school. Also when I do not understand something I ask the teacher for help and if my classmate need my help I do my best by giving them information about the class. If I keep my mind busy I feel good because I experience talking with my classmate. Second, having a job help you by giving you experience for the future. For example, when I started working In my first job I learned a lot things like how to use a computer, I though that I was never going to learn it but I did it and now it help me for my education. Next, now I know that the way of accomplish something you need to have interest to do it. If you do not have interest or if you want to do nothing you never are going to accomplish anything because the best way of do it is by doing something. In my second job I did not know how to use a cellphone but I put all my interest to learned and help my customers by taking their orders. Now in my third job I know many things like : answer the phone, take orders, and especially how give a good customer service. Third, I think helping other people is way of accomplish something. If you help people like homeless you are going to have the opportunity to talk to them and understand why they do not have a place to live or a family to support them. I think this is the best way because some people prefer to leave their home because they do not like the rulers of their parents. This is not the best solution that people should take because everyone need a support of someone. And the best way of accomplish something no matter what it is is by obey and listen the old people who always have the right because they have more experience than us. For example, one day I was homeless because my parents left me with my two brothers and I did not have food to give to them every time that they asked for food my eyes were tearful because they were little and also they did not understand the situation. Now when I see people asking for food it remain me that one day I was like them. I chose to write about we accomplish more if we are always doing something. I believe that you accomplish a lot of things by always doing something and I said by going to school, find a job, and helping other people. I believe t I also know that you can accomplish other things by doing something different but I chose help my self and others. Also I understand that you can accomplish something by doing nothing but one of then is by been at of problems. By doing all of this I considerate my self accomplishing many things.",7,6,7,5,6,6,434,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

The people at the community pool can teach others how to swim but its gonna cost some money but its worth it. I say this is enjoyable because people like to have fun in the pool especially if its during the summer . People can swim and play volleyball or play catch while in the pool to have fun.

90,1750,0756FC69B810,"I would like to talk about the interesting quote that Thomas Jefferson wrote,and how he tell us to ""Determine never to be idle."" He thought that is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something, and that we can accomplish more if we are a active person because the inactivity also serve a purpose in every person life. First,It is awesome has the determination to decide how to do or what do you want to do in your life,because something we may know what we need to do but we dont take a decision to done it. And the reality is that we dont gonna know how much can be done if we dont try to do the things that we wants or needs to done. Second,everyone has the option of accomplish much more than we think,if we are always doing something,for example,finalize any plan or idea that comes to our heads in any moment,time,or second of our lives. The big thing is never stop doing the things that we wants to achieve,and be proud of what you receive. Third,we have the option to choose between doing something or stay inactive,because inactivity also serve a purpose. This is the big deal ,sometimes we dont imagine that we prefer do nothing without see it, we dont see what we are doing at the time. Thats the power of inactivity. We have to see clearly and make a decision of what we decide to choose.

There is handwork and determination behind every successful person. One should have a specific aspiration in their life, and should not do something because they are forced to. There will be a satisfaction if we make a mistake in the work we like to do. We try to find solutions and solve the problem, but if we do something our parents want us to, there will be no contentment. School life should be the time where all the students should relax and have fun in addition to studying. It is not supposed to be a burden to anyone.

They have a chance to learn new things about the career they want to pursue. The balanced system helps them to manage stress level and also concentrate on how their future will unfold. Some schools in the United States also allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of traditional four years. There is no point in students graduating one year early to work or enter to college soon. How does graduating one year early matter? This increases nothing but stress and restlessness. Some students wish to do that not because they want to, but their parents force aspirations on their children. I do not say that it is wrong whatever parents do, but I say that this is not a right way to expect their kids to be successful. All the students need recreational time where they can forget all the school stress and enjoy their time, but parents desire to see their kids as the most successful person, is not letting them to be happy like other kids. Higher grades always does not matter. All that matters is that how can we use in ow much knowledge we attained from the school and how can we use that knowledge in the future. In order to finish high school early, the kids are required to take summer classes and spare their time in the evening. This is not something that is useful for a kid. They need some time to relax their mind, so that concentrate in their studies. They should be able to take their favorite electives as those classes can help them to be successful in the future. I know an incident where one of my cousin graduated early from high school in order to attend college early. He was really smart until high school junior year. He had a great knowledge of what is happening around the world. He would share those with everyone and help us gain some knowledge too,but at the end of the junior year, he was so into graduating early that he did work hard and finally got into a college. He regrets that decision now as he did not learn so many things in the last year of high school that are stressing him now. If everyone finish high school in the traditional way, they will know everything about college and how it works. Then they can do whatever they want to and have at least some knowledge about it. We often hear news about how students commit suicide as they are stressed about academics, so I think they should not do whatever they do not like, and instead work on what they desire for. Hard work is the key to success, but that does not mean that everyone should work hard on something they do not like. instead they should really work hard to achieve what they want. Our aspirations should not be impacted by anyone. If we have our own goal and ways to succeed them, we should follow that way and make sure that we become the most successful individual in that particular field.

94,3246,6AB2B78CE0AF,"One topic that is frequently debated is technology is a positive or negative effects on peoples lives. Technology is a positive effect because mostly everything is online. I believe that technology is good because books are online, get talk to other people through a laptop or a smart phone, and can write it on a notepad or word document. Everyone thinks technology is bad cause of the things they see on the news. Not everyone has time to go to the bookstore and find the book there trying to look for. All books are online now and makes it an easier and faster. When you go on a road trip and nothing to do, you can read on your smart phone or any devices. Parents dont get a lot of time to relax and read a book, but on road trip they can while their children are sleeping in the back. Online books are easy to carry because its on their smart phones. No more looking for your book when you lost it. Plus online books doesnt loose your spot, gives you an option to put a bookmark on the page you want to save, and if you dont know a word it will give you the definition and translate in another language. Some people lives in another country or states and its hard to communicate over a letter or phone call. Using a tablet, laptop, or anything devices that has a camera can do video chat. You cant write a letter and wait for 5-7 days or probably more for a responds. Email is one of the way to send a rough draft or a final draft. Other people can also edit or help you on it. Also on video chat you can call up to how many people and all the time you want. People complain how they cant meet up because they already have plans for other things, but they can just set up a time and day and they can do from everywhere they are at. Technology is going to upgrade is the near future. Right now everything is at a start point, everyone thinks its fun to have a tablet, laptop, smart phone, or headphones. Some people like to show when they get something new, but they have to take care of when they get it because technology are expensive. Just think about it in the future more technology will come and no more paper and pencil because everything will be on technology. Most people like that technology is growing because its better. Even kids have tablets for learning their ABCs and 123s. In schools, they sometimes provide tablets and laptop for students because they want them to learn better and makes sure they have something to do their work on. Sttudents likes technology because they can research what they need for their project or homework. Also they can watch videos how to do something or explain it better. Technology is a good way to communicate with or without speaking. . Theres many ways to get to everything with no issues or problems. I think technology will be a big part of peoples live soon. People should get used to all the technology right now because sooner or later it will become bigger. Everyone will miss paper and pencil, but its a safe and better way to get through everyone. Also its a good way to communicate with other people faster. ",6,7,8,8,7,7,1386,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

It could have a negative part to attending online school. Your WIFI could go slow or not work at all. Having a hard time to achieve the work. Not having a different environment with people with the same age. Not doing the work that they assigned you. When a student have class online they could find it defalcate to achieve the work that they been assigned to. You would not be able to ask question about the problem. Would have to figure it out by your self. Some online website would not help you to achieve what you are looking for. It could give a bad answer and then you got the whole assignment wrong. In videos you could find ways to achieve it but sometimes there is not a lot of videos on things that you are looking for. If you where in a class room you could ask a teacher to show you how to solve it and you would probably would understand it more. In online school sometimes there is no teacher available at the time when you need them. Sometimes student dont have the time and sometimes they dont turn in there work on time. Would just put it to the side and say"" they would probably do it later"" and never do it. It could be found defalcate to achieve the work on time. When you so round your self with people that are the same age. You could have study patterns and you could ask them for help. Doing online school its just you and the computer and the class you are taking. Probably have friends but they mite not be taking the same class as you,would not be a able to work together or study. Doing online school would maybe not have time to socialize with new people. You may work or do other things but most of the times they could be older or you just dont talk to people a lot.

It could be challenge when you dont know what they are talking about or you just dont understand it. Doing your work is one important thing to do, to understand the class and what its teaching. Not just going online to find something that kind of looks like the work and you just copy it down. Sometimes student could get lazy and not do there work. Would probably leave it for the last minute to turn it in. The laziness of student could end up with no good grades or passing the class, would take the class all over. You could get distracted really fast with other things that is going on in your life. Not doing the work, it would not take you no where and would not finish the class on time before the due date. The school would give different ways for student to attend class. It could be online class or going to a classroom in a school. It would be helpful for student to attend more class and probably have more free time. Sometimes student could take advantage on this program to just stay home and do nothing. Life could be hard sometimes and you could go through things that you dont expect to happen. It could be defalcate when you dont know the subject and there is no teacher around to help you. Students always choose whats right for them. Attending classes online could be defalcate to achieve. Would not be sou rand by people their age and probably not do there work.

The first reason is the older students give a advise to the younger students, the older student are helping with the younger students because when the older student are giving advise to the younger student make them intelligent for example when i was in elementary school in fifth grade my principle asked my teacher to give information or to give idea to the third grader on their project and my teacher sand us to the third grade classroom and my classmate was helping with the third graders. The second reason is to help them make more understandable on their subject, the older students are trying to make the younger students more knowledgeable in their subject. for example when i was in sixth grade the my best friend was in seventh grade when i needed help with my homework or with same other classes homework and she was always helped me with my homework, testes, and quizzes and i was getting more understandable in my every subjects and she teached me how to solved problems.

97,2300,1DDC2D1DB4EE,"Dear principal, Im writting this letter to let you know my opinion on the idea of change the school lunch menu into a new healthier menu. I think that it would be a good idea change the lunch menu to be more healthy because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, can help students to stay healthy and could encourage the students to begin eat healthier. Students consume unhealthy food on school alsmost every day, change the menu into a healthier will help students to consume less unhealthy food. Eating unhealthy food daily could damage students in many differents ways. One this ways is that could bring students diseases such as heart problems or could cause obesity in a young age. Additionally change the menu could not just be benefical for students it could also help teachers and personal staff as well to consume less unhealthy food daily. By having a healthier menu could help the students to stay healthier because they will be eating the proteins that they needed to develped better. Also this could help students to do better in things such as sports, and their respectives classes on school. Another advantage of this menu is that will give students the opportunity to try something new instead of having the same food that theyre had been having year over year. In addition by doing this could migth make students realize that having this menu is not just to force them to eat food that they dont like, instead is to keep and them stay healthy. Even thougth that some of the students will migth think that this would be a bad idea because will eliminate some of their favorite food, I think it will be helpful for them because by doing this will encourage them to begin to eat healthier, because that could help them now and on the future. Also this could encourage them to covince their friends and family to begin to eat healty because this could prevent them from having a disease just for eating unhealthy food. In conclusion I think that change the school menu into a new healthier lunch menu is a good idea, because it will help the students to consume less unhealthy food, could help them to stay healthy and could encourage them begin to eat healthier. Those are the reasons that make me think this way, I hope this letter could help you decide that implement this plan is a good idea to change the school for better.

I think that all schools should have programs like this because then the younger student can learn from the older one. Also the older student can possibly be an influence to the younger student like for example if the older student wants to be a doctor then maybe, just maybe, the younger student can be influenced and wants to be a doctor when the student is older. I think the effects of older and younger students working together is good because i think that the students can help each other in many things and if a younger student is getting picked on then maybe the older student can defend them and i just think that if older and younger students are paired up then they can work together and help each other on things outside of school. And maybe one of the older student can become really good friends with the younger one. I honestly think that schools that have programs like this are really good cause students can cooperate with each other and work together and maybe become friends.

103,928,07F3241EB3C6,""" How would pairing older students with younger students in school be helpful for both older and younger students?"" When I was in elementary school in Zambia I skipped 4th grade and went in 5th grade and it was challenging for me to keep up with the work in 5th grade. I was used to doing the same work as the other 4th graders in my school however things changed when I skipped 4th grade to 5th grade. When I got in 5th grade I started doing harder work than I did in 4th grade, I started getting lower grades than I did in 4th grade. When I was in 5th grade (where there were older people than me) I had to work hard to be at the same level as the other 5th graders. This was like taking college classes in high school. Pairing older students with younger students in school will help both the older and younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning and become good examples when they grow up. When younger students are paired with older students, the younger students will be able to learn from the older students. Generally speaking kids are most likely to follow what older people are doing. In this case if older students are paired with younger students the younger students will learn good manners from the older students. Younger students will learn many things from the older students such as: good behavior, hard work, kindness, and etc... When Im sitting around elder at home I learn a lot about different countries and cultures in the world. For instance, when the elders are talking about what is happening in Congo - a country in Africa - I learn about the economy in Congo and its government. It is just like learning in my Civics class at school. This is beneficial for me because I get learn and share about is going in some other places with my Civics teacher. When older students are paired with younger student, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students. Being a good example for younger kids is best for what the will do and be in the future hence, it is why my parents tell me to be the good example for my younger my younger brothers by being well behaved and respectful so that my younger bothers will learn from my behavior. My AVID teacher told me that when his son was young he taught him that boots were bananas and bananas were boots therefor his son knew that boot were bananas and bananas were boots. According to what AVID teacher told me in the pasted sentence it shows that kids do what elders do. It is really important for older people to be good examples for the younger ones. When older students are paired with younger students, the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learn in school and become good examples when they grow up. Additionally when older students are paired with younger students it will encourage the your students to work hard and on the same level as the older students. I have a friend who skipped 7th grade at my school. When I asked her how she was doing in 8th grade, she said at first it was really hard for her to maintain her grades. But she encouraged herself to work hard and get good grades. She had to study every night and on the other hand she had work to do at home. It became challenging for her to keep up with both school work and work she did at home. Ultimately from all her hard work she got a scholarship for college while in middle school. Pairing older kids with younger kids in school is helpful for both the older students and the younger students because the younger students will be able to learn from the older students, the older students will learn how to be good examples for the younger students, and the older students will encourage the younger students to keep learning in school and become good examples for others when they grow up. How would your life be like being in a place where there are no elderly people to learn from? We should always be good examples for younger people so that they can learn from us.

When a teenager have a family who do not care about him he is going to end up having more problems them that one who have a good family. At this point this teenagers has to decide to be himself a man of good and make proud his family and show them what you did with out their help or end up in jail. When the person dont have support from their family they do what they can so they can have some money on their pockets and have some food on the table for their family.

For instance, some people that apply to a job but they did not present on time will give their new boss a bad impression about them that he or she will want to fire them. All in all,people always has to make a good impression the first time and they will have better opportunities. However, some people may argue that first impressions can be change because people may have regrets and they will try to apply themselves and do their best in what they did wrong in the past .This argument is weak though because not everything in life can be change easily. For example, some people may regrets how they were in high school with their teachers but they can not do nothing now because some of their teacher already past away. Even though, first impressions are impossible to change because no all the time people will have the opportunities to a second chance. Finally, people can get on trouble for how they show the first time. For example,some individuals that deal with other people always has to give a great impression the first time. Additionally, people that works at a restaurant has to have a good appearance because if they do not have it they will lose costumers,lose their jobs. In a word, a good impression the first time will save people from trouble. People always have to be careful in what they show or do the first time. There are great reasons for always make a good impression the first time because individuals can not go back the time,can lose opportunities, and can get on trouble. What would be if all individuals make a bad impression the first time?",7,7,7,6,6,7,1825,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Growing up, Smash Bros has always been one of my favorite games as a child and it had helped bring my siblings and I closer together. I can get paid for winning a tournament, and it will help me get through in life. I know that I cant just win a tournament right off the bat but I want to try, because the thrill of just winning and having fun is what makes people enjoy this game. Winning a ""Super Smash Brothers"" tournament is something that I can enjoy while helping me in life. ""Super Smash Brothers"" had helped me bond closer with my siblings throughout my life. Even if weve gotten tired of doing other activities together, weve never got tired of fighting each other in the game. Fighting with my siblings had molded me into the competitive person I am today, so because of that I want to fight other people and get something out of it. It helped me learn to be competitive because its a competition in the real world. Smash Bros helped me discover other games to enjoy with others like Kirby franchise and the ""Legend of Zelda"" franchise. Beating other players with characters I love makes me want to play more with new people. I never really had the best communication skills, but I can enjoy playing different video games and competing in tournaments with others while improving my social skills. Winning a tournament can help me get money, so I can buy my necessities in life. Getting the money could help me buy luxuries like a house or a car. If I can win a tournament and get the money, I could have those things and even get more that I need. If I can buy those then I wont have to have help from my family. I could get other games that I enjoy watching other players play. Just by watching people play these games makes me want to compete with them. I always loved competing with others and now I could even get paid to do so if I win a tournament. ""Super Smash Bros"" just gives me the thrill of competing with others and having fun while doing so. People always get this thrill of winning and it keeps them going to win more. Every time I beat my brother in a game I get excited each time, and I want to beat new people just to get that thrill. If you dont get that thrill of wanting to do more of what you are doing then you wouldnt do that thing again for a while. Like other games, Smash Bros bring players together by competing with each other and just having fun. I want to experience that with other people in tournaments. Winning a tournament or just competing in one will help me learn that doing activities are not always as fun as doing them with others. My life will be brighter when I accomplish something big like winning a Smash Bros tournament. Ive always enjoyed the fun in playing games with others and talking to them about it.

110,1436,196096A1C048,"I would like to become a Cardiologist in my future, so that I can save peoples lives by charging them less money and nobody has to suffer like my uncle, it is one of the high-paying jobs and there are less heart surgeons in the world. My uncle was detected with a hole in his heart since he was born. But my family couldnt afford the money for the surgery, so they left him like that itself. He started feeling more pain when he studying his final years of high school. When he went through the surgery, he had exams going on. Despite the pain, he studied for his exam and passed in flying colors. Many people cannot afford the surgeries for not only heart but for many organs in their body. So, I wanted to change that and help all the people in the world, so that they can live happily at least once in their lifetime. It is one of the high-paying jobs in the world. My family was not able to treat my uncle because of not having enough money at that time, so I wanted to earn money and save lives at the same time as much as I could. In this way, every body in my family will not be able to endure all the pain they had even before I was born. I will do anything to keep my family happy. In this world, we have more doctors in other fields but not much in the cardio field. I wanted to change that because half of the worlds population has hidden heart defection, they dont know still, like my uncle. This is because of less cardiologists in the world. When people go to the heart surgeons, the doctors ask more money then the usual charge as there are only a few doctors in that field. People cannot afford the money they ask and just leave their defected hearts, they continue doing their day-to-day works. If this continues, then people will die without even enjoying their whole life in this world. I wil become a heart surgeon and charge my patients the money they can afford. With this I will also be happy and the people who come to me will also be happy as they get cured. In conclusion, becoming a cardiologist is one of big dreams I want to achieve in my life. I will save peoples lives only by costing them with affordable money. I wont let my fellow people go through what my uncle did, so I would do anything to save their lives. People are dying across the world because there are only a few doctors in that field and they also charge them high, so I will change these peoples lives by doing the opposite of what the other doctors did.

You always want to know what are your own limits. First, I think what he is trying to said with "" Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is always have big dreams bigger than you and have big ambition too.

116,3446,B942E0DA6A0F,"I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, it is best to be yourself than to be someone youre not. You wont have to meet some jobs perspectives. You wont have to be someone youre not. You can have many accomplishments throughout your life. The first reason as to why I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson is because, when it comes to jobs it can be real tough for some people. Some jobs ask who you really are as a person, once you let them know they dont like the response. But, there are some jobs that will accept you and will like who you are truly. Second of all dont have to be someone youre not. You shouldnt have to please others only because they dont like who you are as an individual. Some might even say that its for the best when in reality it isnt. You shouldnt have to be the opposite of who you are just so you dont get judged on. Pay no attention to those who dont accept you for being nothing but yourself, and dont change for them unless youre doing it for you. You should always please yourself no matter what. Lastly like Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote, ""To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishment."" That writing is nothing but the absolute truth. Your individuality can bring you so much success. It can take you places you cant even imagine. Being yourself can benefit you as a person, people can perhaps like even love the real you. You can become a role model to those who are having trouble on deciding if they should be themselves or be what this world wants them to be. People could admire you and accept you even more. In conclusion I agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson because it is best to be you own individual self than not, because you wont meet jobs perspectives, be someone youre not, and also it comes with amazing accomplishments. Some think otherwise because the believe that it would make life more simple and easy. Also you might find that being your own individual self gets you no where.

Generic_Name thought about what her mom told her and she decide that the best option was attend to normal classes at school. If we attend to regular classes, we are not going to feel alone and we can make new friends. Schools provides the chance to participate at clubs.

Activities and clubs are a good way to help and to prepare students for the future. They have the option to enjoy a team from their preference. For example, a person who like football.

To pay attention during classes can be hard because of other classmates are making noise or its really hard to understand. Teachers talk about our grades and gives us advices to improve them.

120,427,88816FFD8A5C,"Online Learning Who doesnt want to be left in the house all day using an electronic device with online access? Although students save money and time by taking classes from home. It is not beneficial to learn online because students lose focus of what they are learning and tend to easily get distracted when theyre in their house, students cant have a one on one conversation with a teacher nor discuss with classmates, and students could also face technical difficulties when attending online classes from home. Losing focus has a big impact in learning. For example, my friend Generic_Name sent me a text message last month, right when I started studying for my history mid-term exam. I responded back to Generic_Names text, and without realizing we kept on messaging past midnight. This shows how easily students get distracted at home with a cellular device and how easy it is to lose focus. The next morning I decided to get to school an hour early and review one on one with my teacher. Secondly, taking classes online doesnt just mean you dont have a physical teacher or instructor that you can question lively, but also means that it will be challenging to find answers to your questions. I remember in my sophomore year a kid in our econ class named Generic_Name was really sick for a while so he had ended up taking classes online. Generic_Name was a straight A student, always was first to answer the teachers questions and he also used to ask questions. Thankfully Generic_Name healed towards the end of the year and I asked him if he benefited and if he recommends attending classes from home. The straight A student Generic_Name said it was a real challenge to take the class online and he finished the class a month after he should have with a B- average. Generic_Name had also said that one of the most difficult parts about attending a class online was his laptop not functioning at all times, and not having a teacher you can talk and converse with one on one. Finally, using your personal computer and internet connection can always be an issue. You cant always depend on your computer, not just the computers but even people arent perfect. Another main problem Generic_Name had when attending classes online was his laptop and network connection. Generic_Name explained that he always faced technical difficulties. When his laptop wasnt functioning right, the only thing he could do was to stop the lesson and wait for his dad to get the laptop repaired, which took time. Each month, either his laptop or internet connection would not cooperate, so he finished the class a month later than everyone. In conclusion, Everyone would like to save money and time by taking classes from home. But getting distracted, not asking your teacher questions when you need to, and wasting money on laptop repair is not worth it at all. Learning from a far distance could also be an option but when asking if it is beneficial, we can say that it is not by looking at the listed reasoning.

122,1232,E0538F7AB083,"I agree with this statement, first impressions with people or places are difficult to changed. But first the definition of Impression is a lasting effect, opinion, or mental image. Is a belief of understanding of sth. Here is a example in a sentence, I made a bad impression by arriving late for the interview. I always see the bad and good things in each person and in each places too. But sometimes the impressions can change, It depends on the person. Now Im gonna make some examples about the first impressions in people and with places. For example, If Im going to a restaurant the first impressions that Im looking for, are If the local is cleanly(floor, chairs, etc..), the bathroom they arent dirty, the employers(making sure that they are using gloves when they touch the food and when they prepair the food, Plague(rats, cockroach, etc..) thats very important because we dont want to get transmit a bacteria or something like that). Another example, If Im going to a friend house, my first impressions that Im looking for, are typically the same of the restaurant, instead of the part of the employes(obviously), but if the house is dirty, for example: (the floor, the kitchen, the bathroom, etc...) that impressions can change for me, because they probably clean the house everyday, but just that day they dont clean it. And now Im gonna make some example of first impressions for a person, the first impression that I saw in a person is the personality(vibes, etc..), the education level(respectful, responsable, etc..), the way of she/he dress it(outfits) thats when the phrase ""dress to impress"" takes place, if the person is comic, etc.. Some person do the same, but some person just talk in the bad way of other persons, and sometimes they dont know them, they dont talk to them, and thats too bad impression for the person that is doing that, they are wrong :/ So my point, is I just said before, the impressions can change and it depends on the person.

123,3885,D81AEDF6E262,"Technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. For example, people can check out books, they can do shopping from online, and play games without speaking to another person. However the technology had positive and negative effects on peoples lives. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation, actually many people believe that technology can change the attitude of the people and technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. Although some people say that technology is good because all the people can use it for an emergency situation. Imaging that a family lives faraway from us and need help and nobody lives around this family. Further, in this situation is very necessary the technology because they can be in a very hard situation. For example, when I was in my country many families were living faraway from the city, and some of them did not have any device to communicate with their families or another person; however, some of them were having a really hard lives because sometimes they got sick and they did not have the help from others and they died because the technology was necessary by the moment. In addition, many people believe that technology is bad because technology can change the attitude of the people. In 1978 people were more respectful and some of them did not study but they show the respect to each other. However, people keeps saying that a person change the attitude because of: movies, music, novels, and cartoons. It is true the some people the use technology constantly they can get mental problems or they get blind using technology over and over. For example, I know this families that have a girl that is fifteen years old, and she likes to see many TV shows. This young girl acts like she is more older than other teenagers because she does not obey to her parents. Her conduct is very bad, but that is the way her parents are growing her. This girl goes out whatever she wants and with whatever she wants. Sometimes I think that is her parents fault because they still keep buying many technology things. They do not paid attention to how their daughter is using the technology. By contrast, allowing children using technology at young age is very bad because some of then do not use it appropriate, and when they get older their parents can not control them because they learn many bad things from the technology. Otherwise parents can go out with them instated of using technology. Also, many people believe that technology is bad because technology has more important people behind a screen than people around them. It is true that many people are more focus on a screen almost all the time. The Psychologist Generic_Name said that ""it is better have conversations face to face because people can be more clearly about situations"", and he is right because using technology people can lie behind the screen. By this time factories create more devices that makes more people loose their mind in technology. Moreover, about ninety percent of all the people paid more attention to the technology than their families, or people around them. There is one example about lying while using technology, about five months ago I was reading this book that is call "" Behind the Wed "" and was very interested because the character was a woman teacher that was having communication with someone that she did not know nothing about it; however, when they were sending messages the person the was behind was acting the was a man but was a girl acting like a man. When this teacher ask her about if they can do a video call she said not because she was lying to her. There are more examples the happens and real life to many people. In conclusion, technology can be good or bad, but thats depends on the manner of how the people wants to use it. Technology does not stop increasing, yet people have to know how to use it in the appropriate moment and the correct form. Technology can change the life of many people.

124,179,D001F6D3A0D0,"Everybody would like to be succesful in the life, and thats possible, but is not easy you have to try one time and one more time until you have what you want; it doesnt matter how many times you try for it. In my opinion there are a lot of people that if they fail one time they give up and shouldnt be like that because you will be happy if you complete your goal, you will be a good example to help others to be successful, you can earn more than you expected. Complete your goal can be really important for you, and will make you happy, for example, my Mom wanted to have a beauty salon, but she knew that it wouldnt be easy; she started with a small room and a few customers, sometimes she didnt have custumers, and that made her think to close the beaty salon, but she never gave up, now she has a big room with a lot of customers; she is happy because she is doing what she likes, and the most important part she never give up. That is why we have to try many times until we are happy for what we have or what we are doing. Some people would like to have an example to make their goals, and you can be a good example if you don,t give up at firts time that you fail, for example, I have a cousin, Generic_Name, she was a bad student; she didnt care about her grades, tests, homeworks, and nothing about the schools. when I moved to live with her, she saw my grades and all that things that I do. She stared to ask me how I can have good grades in the tests and be successful, and I said to her,"" you need to have more enthusiasm for the school"" ,and now she has a really good grades and she is going to graduate this year. If we dont stop even if we fail, we can hel others to be successful. Some people might say that you lost the time trying something many times, however, you can earn more than you expect if you try as much as you can, for example, I saw a video on facebook; there was a man that was loking for a job to support his family; he went to many places, but nobody gave him a job. One time he was walking on the street, and he saw a man trying to fix his car, and without thinking he went to help the other man after that the man was thankful for the help, and he offered a job for the man. The man who was without job; he didnt know that he will get a job on that situation, what would happend if the man would be sleeping in his house; he would never get that job. That is why we never have to lose the enthusiasm to be successful; we never know what is prepared for us. It is clear that you will feel good if you complete your goals, and you will be a good example of persistence to help others to be successful, you will earn more than you expect if dont give up at the first time that you fail, and maybe is not easy, but you have your whole life to make it happen, and nobody will tell you when to stop; it doesnt matter how many times you try or you fail. The most important part is that you will be successful if you are constant and and what you are doing. ",6,6,8,7,7,5,2867,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

128,106,113B1543C433,"If School programs offer Student to graduate early instead of waiting the four year to graduate. Graduating a year earlier would be a great thing for student to do because there are people who are trying to manage work and school but its difficult for some people because they cant do both, If they work and they come late after work and the next morning they wake up tired from work that they are tired to go to school and it makes it difficult to go to work and then go to school. A reason why I feel students should graduate early is because if they graduate early they can go to college, and if college allows them to choose their hours they can decide on what time they can go to college or the days. It could also depend on what you want to do career wise. If they allow that you can work and go to college and it would make it easier for you and you wont feel tired after college to go to work. For example,My mom graduated early and she was able to work and and go to college as well. Another reason is that if you go to high school and work its difficult because you have to worry about school and work, sometimes thats a problem because when you come late from work and in the morning when you have to go into school your tired and you dont wanna go to school and your tired and you cant concentrate in school but I feel like when your in college you can choose your time and date and it makes it easier for you. For Example, I have a friend who works and goes to school to and he tells me its difficult for him to manage school and work and sometimes hes even tired to go to school. Even when hes at school hes tired and cant do any of his work because hes tired and its hard for him to concentrate. The last reason is if people were to graduate a year earlier from high school. They can also go to college and depending on on what they want in their career, they could also graduate college early and start you career early For Example, My Uncle graduated High school earlier and he also graduated college which made it easier for him to start his own business and it really helped him out in life and hes really happy because he graduated early. If you choose to graduate and do classes in the summer you would feel accomplished and you would feel relief you wont have to be there for 4 years and only 3 years. If you finish early you can have time for work and college and also you get start your career early and you would feel happy with what you have accomplished.

Now i love drawing with a Passion. when students set goals they can get better and achieve more then they can ever imagine they could. setting up goals and achieving is a good representation because its showing them that they can achieve and do more than they could ever imagine As you have read self-esteem is build off by effort, achieving goals and having self-respect is how you get better . only when we have self-esteem students learn better in classes because they will putting more effort on activities in school be more confident with answers and not be shy about getting it wrong students learn from studying or from their mistakes.",6,7,6,6,5,7,2301,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiams"". First of all,learned something from any failure because we are humans and we all make big mistakes in our lifes. Those who learned form their mistekas are the best to help the ones that are passing the same process. Learn because there would be always more failures in our lifes.

138,3206,1D327ADD95AA,"Whether the limitation of human contact due to technology has had a positive or negative effect on peoples lives, is a constant topic of discussion. Technology is an amazing tool, with countless positive effects. It has made society what it is today. Without it people would not know life the way that it is now. Technology makes many activities in life possible, which before would have been impossible. The first man to walk the moon did it by the means of technology. The vehicles which allow people to commute to work, or travel the world, were also created through technology. Buildings are powered with technology and our houses are to. Our whole world is surrounded by technology, and without it people would not live life the way that they do now. If a day came when people would have to give up all their technological advantages, life would be a catastrophe. People would not be able to get to work, there would be no way to talk to friends or family that are far away, the whole teaching system would have to be rebuilt, and many other countless horrible things would occur if technology where to be taken away from the people. We are highly dependent on technology, and that is not a negative thing. People have learned to live with it, and it makes life much easier than before the technology era started. Easy and fast communication is one of the most important contributions that technology has provided to the new world. Peoples phones, computers, and even TVs now can connect everyone to loved ones. Human contact, is now even easier than it was before technology came into play. Now people can call a friend, and talk with them for hours, no matter the distance. People can text with family and friends, and it is even possible to constantly check on them with video calls. Before technology, people would have to travel many miles to come into contact with friends and family, but now thanks to technology everything has changed. Now, looking at family and friends through a little screen is a possibility, and not just something that happens in a futuristic TV show. People can tell close ones how their day is going, what has been going on in life, and every other small detail that could possibly pop into ones head. Losing human contact because of technology is not something to be worried about. Technology does not get rid of human contact. What it actually does is create the contact. It makes it possible to build bonds with people no matter the distance, and it also allows people to connect with loved ones when ever wanted. Technology is also a very important part of current entertainment. Netflix, Apple Music, YouTube and many other apps keep people entertained for hours non-stop. Watching movies and listening to music, was something that used to be only done at concerts and at movie theaters. Thanks to the positive effects of technology, now a day enjoying good music, and movies is something that can be done at home. The best thing of these apps is the low prices, and thousands of content, which is updated over and over again constantly. Having easy access to good music and good movies while laying in the comfort of home is an activity which most people in the world would enjoy. These apps also make it possible for people with no connections to the world of entertainment to pursue a career that will be enjoyable. YouTube is one of the leading online video streamers in the world. People who want to pursue a career in entertainment have the opportunity to post their videos online and gain fans. This is something which would have been impossible before the technology era. People love completing tasks while comfortably laying in bed inside home. Technology is so amazing, that it has made this possible to. People need to shop, but sometimes the stores which have the items that are needed are not close to their homes. Technology knows this, and it has made it possible to go to thousands of sites online and purchase anything. It is possible to buy shoes, clothing, electronics, and even food. When people shop in a normal retail store, it is possible to find sales and the items needed, but shopping online is a totally different experience. By shopping online it is much more likely to find the best possible price for an item, due to all the options that are available. There are also many items which are available for purchase online, but not available at stores. Shopping online is also surprisingly a very entertaining experience. Browsing thousands of items, and ultimately finding the best price is an activity which can keep people entertained for plenty of time. Shopping online is much easier, and comfortable than actually going to the stores to find the items that are needed. Technology is a constant growing phenomenon, which needs to be constantly worked on. It is the fuel that powers the world. If it were to run out, everything would stop moving. With the technological discoveries that are being made every day, people are living longer lives, the depths of the world are being discovered, and new ways to sustain earth are being presented. If the way technology is growing continues at the pace it is currently going at, the world might find ways to cope with global warming, and maybe even find the cure to deadly diseases like cancer. This is how important technology is to the world. It goes to the point that if it is studied correctly it can save peoples lives, and even the world. Technology has already changed the world forever, and it will be no time at all for another invention to change the world once again. These changes will be for the good, and technology will prove to positively change the world once again.",9,8,10,9,9,9,386,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"

Failure plays an important role in the pursuit of the success. We learn of our owns mistakes, including others persons mistakes. At the same time, is very important to be enthusiasm and with a good attitude to address and learns of ours mistakes, to continue progressing in the pursuit of success. If we do not try, we do not make mistakes, if we do not make mistakes, we do not learn, and we will not be success as we want to. It is so important that when we make a failure.

140,2012,6BB4BEB51A80,"People can learn without making mistakes. People should seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important. People should not make their own decision. First, they would learn in a better way, also people need someone to advise them. As well, the world would not be destroy as it is now. People would learn in better way. To begin, if people seek the guidance from experts they would not make a lot of mistake, and their life would be better. For example, a person who seek the guidance from experts it would have more opportunities. Likewise, a student who doesnt understand math class can talk with his teacher or other expert in math and the teacher can explain it. On the other hand, if the student doesnt talk to anyone he provably would fail math. In addition, a person who get a new job need someone to explain it what to do. While, if nobody explain it the new employee would make many mistakes. As you can see, the people who take the advise of a experts would learn better. People need someone to advise them. For example, everybody have problems, but not everybody have someone to advise them. First, a new student came to my school and he didnt know the rules of the school, so he did something that it wasnt good and he get in big trouble, but if someone would explain him he wouldt get any trouble. Therefore, many teenager do whatever they want because they doesnt have anyone to guide them, and the result of that is those teenager get it many troubles each day. While, the teenager who are guide for any expert they do well in everything they do. As you can see, everyone need someone to guide for the right way, and nobody would do a lot of mistakes. The world would not be destroy as it is today. For example, if everyone would have the opportunity to have someone to advice them the world wouldn be danger to anyone. Furthermore, in many countries the people are in danger because their governors doesnt know how to guide a country, but if an expert took the control of the government the people would not be in danger anymore. Likewise, teenager sometimes live by them-self, so they dont have anyone to tell them what is good and what is bad; teenager many times do bad things and they dont even know. As I repeat, if the whole world would have someone to guide everyone the world would not be destroy as its today, everything would be in peace. In conclusion, if everyone would have the opportunity to have an expert guide during life the entire world would be better. Likewise, people would make better choices in their life. Also, with a expert guide the people nobody would be in danger again. Furthermore, teenagers and kids would have a better future around the world; as well, the world would be in peace, and people would learn in a better way. Also, if someone doesnt know something he/she can talk with an expert and the expert would guide her/him. Finally, life would be better and easier if everyone talk to an expert what is going on, so nobody would do a big mistake.

Although some people say that accompish does not serve a purpose, nevertheless, others say that accomplish does serve a purpose because a student could be working on homework and playing a sport. To beging, accompish more time on a sport. For example, a soccer team was trying to accomplish their shooting because they had a soccer game. They also knew that they could use more practice on thier shooting skills on the goalily. This shows that, the soccer team didnt want to waste time on something that they could be practeing for. Clearly, Futhermore, accompish something on homework. This proves that, a college student wants to get their homework all done because they want to go do something fun with their friends. They could also be going out with people so they might as well get all their work done. This shows that, if a student wants to accompish something they are willing to give it a try and move on.

However; when you try and keep trying somehting is when you grow up more and more each time. Additionaly, we grow more with stuff that we are good already, because we become more and more greatful. Primaly, we think that by trying what we already know, it makes us better each time. Generic_school made a survey to all seniors to get everyones opinion base on Unless you try to do something beyod what you have mastered, you will never grow. sevendy five percent of students desagree, they said that you learnd more and more of what ever you already know.

Therefore, knowing more what you already know and you are good at it, you will become better and better each time, never give up on what you are already good at. Secondary, expericences make us better, we learnd more of we already know, of what we are capable to do. We have a company that has to do with Generic_school, they go to a lot of schools to talk the the juniors, and seniors of what they think about Emersons statement. fifty percent agree and the other fifty persent desagree, because some student say that we need more new stuff to keep succesing in life, and other say that we can still seccess with what you already know.

For examole when i want to buy a pair of shoes i ask my mom, my dad, and sometimes i ask people that i do not know, but different people help me to see witch pair of shoes i should pick and there i can see what pair of shoes are the best. somepople do not like to know what other said when i think is better when everybody said their opinion To continue,listen other opinion of different people make to choice better. Listen different opinion help us to know what other people think about it. For example my friend always ask me how she looks, so she want to know my opinion, and she dont only ask me. She ask different people to know their opinion.

If people know opinion of different persons,help us to pick better. For example sometimes i want to buy a pencil but i like two pencil, but i only have money for one.

My problems opened up so many chances for me to do my best in life. Problems will always have a chance for you, so you can do better in your life. Never lose that one chance in life. Those chances will not come back and you will regret not taking the chances. I took a chance to live with my mom and now I am happy with her. Hard problems make you build up strength on yourself.

Of course that the school always should have The students control. Because students can have all very good without problems, and thats why the school and the Teachers should have their controls, all the students should have all done, if they want to be in an activity, because If the school did not take the controls, of the students they will not respect, the schools and the activities rulers, my Opinon will be that students should have time to do some activities and they should have time to study, to do all the Homeworks, like they dont should have a lot of activities, they needed to do the homeworks to. for example, if i Would like to be in some activities like sports i have to do all my homeworks first,have good grades at school. i Know that the activities are good for your body, normally the body always need some activities, the school always Have some activities to do and thats really good for your body.

153,670,ACB4771E367E,"Imagine living an outgoing life or a lazy life. Its like talking about a traveler and a video game addict. In my opinion I think we do accomplish more if we are always doing something because when you are out doing something you gain experience, also when your out doing something you tend to meet new people, even though some would argue that living a inactivity life also serves a purpose because inactivity allows you to live a life closer with your family. First when your out doing something you gain experience. In my opinion when your constantly out you gain social experience. For example you wont be as shy to speak to others, and you wont be awkward when socializing. Also, when your out you are traveling and getting to understand and appreciate many different cultures around the world. Another example you get a closer look into the lives of everyone around the world and allows you to help them get through any hurdles. These are some reasons on why gaining experience and understanding others is important. Also when your out doing something you meet new people. For example your always talking to people when your out so you tend on making new friends. When your traveling and in need of a place to stay, by making new friends around the world you are possibly covered and dont have to spend a dime on a hotel. Another example when your out doing something you can possibly meet the right one, future (Husband/Wife). Ive seen many stories of people traveling doing something and they end up falling in love with someone. This is why meeting new people by doing something is a good thing. Some would argue that living an inactivity life serves purpose. For example you get to sit around and just hang out. Also you can make friends and do many things through the online world. Sure all these things are good you get to have a different form of fun. However youre just being plain lazy and choosing the simple way of living. Also once you have to go out into the real world youll most likely be awkward and shy. This is why being inactive can be some what good but also bad. In conclusion being able to travel and get to understand different cultures also gain experience is super fun. Also having friends from all around the world is just so cool and brings many different kinds of stories to the table. Even though living an inactivity life has its flaws it also has its pros theres so many different opportunities but your not living a fulfilled life. In my opinion we do accomplish a lot more in life being active and going out doing something than being at home being lazy not doing anything. This is everything on why I think we accomplish more by being active. ",9,8,8,8,9,7,2322,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
154,1196,AD6986B56719,"Michelangelo once said ""The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark."" I agree with this because we should never set our standards low even if it means we will reach our goal quicker; we should always have a strong mindset in completing and tackling hard tasks no matter how hard it can be. This can be mentally be difficult for some people because they like to quit when something is too hard for them, this shows how weak minded a person can be and end up never completing that achievement. If youre setting your achievement low knowing that you can complete it, why do it then? It will be a waist of time and youll most likely get no satisfaction out of it. Waking up in the morning and looking at your to do list and seeing that hard goal you have to complete can really throw off people. They look at it and starting off their morning can put them in a bad mood. This can mean that the person is not mentally strong enough to finish his or her task, it can take weeks, months, or even years; some people just dont have the patience for it. This most likely means that youll never complete anything difficult in your life and end up always choosing an easy goal knowing you can complete it in a short amount of time, That type of mindset will never get you anywhere in life, no one will want a lazy person working for them in the future; theyll want a hard working and determined individual. A person should always set a task for them that is hard, but something they know they can complete. This can be working overtime at your job for that sports car youve always wanted or even just saving up money for retirement. Setting your goal low can mean the person will never grow up to be a strong individual or even be a hard worker. After completing your goal you should always get lots of joy, happiness, and satisfaction; if youre not getting any of those youre doing something wrong. It should never feel like your goal was just a waist of time or you did this for nothing, you should come out of your goal as a stronger and happier person. Having a negative attitude can play huge role in why youre not completing hard goals. Two keys factors in completing a hard task are having the right mindset and having a positive attitude; Having neither of these will already be putting you in a major disadvantage. Through out your day you should always have a positive personalty, who would want to talk to an angry and negative person? These are very difficult skills to learn it takes patience and time, but already having these two key traits can put you in the biggest advantage for completing your hard task. Not lots of people embrace these because they think they are useless that it has nothing to do with your mind but more about the actions of the person. In conclusion I highly agree with Michelangelos statement, it can sometimes bring out the worst in us but that is how we grow and learn as a person. This quote separates the lazy week minded people out there from the hard working, strong minded, and positive people. Setting a hard task and taking the time to complete can influence yourself into completing harder goals you have planned for yourself in the future. This is how successful people are born and become who they are and make a name for them self, no millionaire would ever tell you to set your standards low just because you feel like you cant complete a hard goal; they would tell you to push yourself mentally and physically no matter what the cost may be. Some people are just born without that mentality that most successful people posses, you cant teach lazy but you most certainly can teach hard work, determination, striving, and dedication.",8,9,9,9,9,7,2335,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"

157,3364,DEDD5C568B4C,"I agree with being honest at all times because you need to be honest with your true friends, you need to be honest with your family, and you to be honest with yourself. The first reason you need to be honest is with your true friends because your true friends are going to want you to tell the truth to them. Your friends always check on you to see if you are okay and tell you how is your life so far .You got to tell the truth to them because they really care about you a lot. For example, what happens if you are in a bad situation like being chased by a stranger and you told your friend to call 911 because you are being chased. The police got there in time to arrest the stranger who was chasing you. You see, friends care about you and for your safety as well. Your friends will always got your back no matter what happens to you or them. Your friends just want to hangout with you have fun . The second reason you need to be honest is with your family . You got to be honest with your family because you got to tell them the truth of what is going on in your life. What happens if your Mom or Dad are calling you while you are walking to school with your ringer cut off. They just checking on you and for your safety. Your does not want you tell them lies cause sometimes kids do not want to tell their parents what is going on in school. You never know when they are getting bullied and being harassed. The lesson of the story is that always be honest and tell the truth with your family. The third reason you need to be honest is with yourself at all times. You have to trust yourself because you never know what is going to happen to you. For Example, someone is selling drugs in school and he told you that you want some drugs . You have to think is this going to kill me or just say no. In my opinion I would say no to person who is selling the drugs. This actually can happen in real life . If you were in that position just say no or make an excuse . The lesson of the story is always be honest to yourself.

I agree just not only for having just a good attitude but to make some one smile and the bad vibes go away Im grateful that I have a good attitude. Also maybe having a good attitude in the work place will speed up your day so you could go back home and do nothing and relax. I work at a restaurant and I feel as in if i have a bad attitude at work time goes slower but when i have a good attitude at work time goes so fast. Its your first impression of a person it help if u have a good attitude it will help you on the long run. Make a situation for bad to good for a hundred to zero fast which is a good thing. Then, I think that having a good attitude at work will help a lot of people in the long run because you could find your future wife and you could find someone famous or better things. And most people dont think about how having a good and not bad attitude will benefit them. Having a good attitude will take you places were people could never think of and will help up be successful in like get a good job, get promoted,then get to the top and make lots of money. I know a lot of people want to be rich and make lots of money so got good attitude in life some dont. everyone have their own ideas and have their own perspective of each other. Lots of people are negative in the world most people have it the hard way became the are poor dont have anything more to live for but that is wrong people you need to keep your head up no matter what happens. After that, I think that I also said that being kind to people and giving them a smile will cheer a lot of people up, and make the world a better place and make everyone be grateful for what they have. People dont want to be by themselves they want to be with other humans and wants a better for everyone. In all honestly people should work for a better work space and have a good attitude. Having a good attitude is extremely good for work place and more. I think that people need to know whats bests for them and there heath.

159,575,D9FA943B5453,"Should schools control the involvement of extracurricular activities, or should extracurricular activities be left to student and their families? Many students become involved in extracurricular activities to enrich their educational experiences, and some even become involved in so many activities that they have little time to study or complete homework assignments. Extracurricular activities can affect a student but also can help students. Extracurricular activities should be left to the students and their families because students would do something they like, and students will concentrate more in class. First reason why extracurricular activities be left to the students is because, student would be doing something they like. For example, the student chooses a activities they like such as soccer:they would be having fun without stressing out over school or any other problem going on. Many student wouldnt like for the school to put them in a activity they dont like. In fact, many students would prefer to not be in a activity they do not like, than being in the activity they dont like. Second reason why extracurricular activities should be left to students is because, it would make them concentrate in classes more. For example, many activities require to have good grades to be part of it. Student would focus more in class and work harder to get good grades. This would make the student look good but also the school for having students who out reach others. Having good grades is important when being in any other activity because the student would have to manage their time for school,activities, and homework. In conclusion, students and their family should be able to control what the student take or not take. If schools were to control what a student can take student would be who they are. They will also not care about the activity and start not caring about their grades. Student would also be happy and calm not having to worry about something they dont enjoy doing. Students are still growing more and more; the more students we have which means more students to be happy. Student shouldnt be forced to take something they dont enjoy because they wont learn anything from it if they dont like that.",8,7,8,7,6,6,3057,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

Many of them walk to get to school every day or ride a bicycle. They face many problems but the biggest one is weather. The climate can change quickly, when is raining a lot or is cold these students stay at home, because there is no way how they can get to school. Students can benefit by not attending everyday to school. For students who live far away from school is a great option, because they safe time and also they can work during the day. As we see many students have a job after school, and this is hard for them because they have to be active in school. There is a big problem because they come tired to school, and you see them sleeping in classes. They can not be concentrate because they do not have time to sleep. Many of them do not have time to do homework, or different projects they have to complete. It is a great option to have schools that offers distance learning. This action help many students but also can affect them. In my opinion when you attended to school everyday you can learn more. Because you have all the resources you need to understand, and complete the assignments. But students who like to work hard and take their time to studying in their houses, it can also be easy for them. Before that there was not technology is was extremely hard. Now that the science had grown up, and the technology appear, we have a way more opportunity to do many things. One opportunity is to studying online from our houses. As I said now that we have technology, we have more opportunities and is really easy to find stuff that you need to learn in your school. In my conclusion, I think is good for our society having those school who offers distance learning. Because many students can not be in school everyday, and this action help them to keep studying.

I agree with this quote from Winston Churchill,""Success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm."" Its an important role that failure plays in our daily lives. Failure leads to many different directions,But, if we learn our mistakes we can understand what we did wrong. People sometimes have the enthusiasm or optional energy to get thought the obstacles. Some-others dont which its acceptable for this type of situation. Giving up faith is likely, giving up on yourself as an individual. Tools are like megalo, it helps us become the person we are today. Tools guide us to consist of good devolpement of character. It can read our thoughts and mind as a reader, when you specifically need them in hand. For example, working on a project from school, you use the internet to find those evidence to support your statement. You may never know that the tools you were looking for has been sitting their waiting to be taken. You knew it was the item you were searching for, soon enough it was a success. Without failures or mistakes, we wont even understood what errors we had. Life wouldve become a lot harder, stressed, overwhelmed etc. The more mistakes we resolved, more issues fills up. We wont even be able to undo our issues. It would waste more of youre time. I would argue with this fact, success comes from mistakes and obstacles along the path. It tells us what we should do and not fall into the same hole again. It takes time and effort to adjust,So, we must contribute as a whole.

163,3853,22CFD6C961E3,"Some school districts allowing there students to graduate in 3 years instead of the traditional 4 year is something I strongly consider, and surely something I think we all also have to consider. Being able to graduate in 3 years not only gives you an extra year, but also gives you the proper amount of time to plan your future. The amount of time that you would be spending in school would be a year less. Given a year, it is up to you, how you use it and what your going to do with it. Getting a job would help save you a lot of money for college. Having a year off doesnt exactly mean that you have to go to school, but instead getting a job will be very beneficial. Whether its to support your family, save money for school, or even for pocket money, knowing that you have not only time, but also extra money, will help you realize that there isnt much to stress about. Jobs also dont have to be something that is outside of school. Having a job that is academic wise or just something temporary to have the experience, will help open you up to more opportunities. Whether you are looking forward to go to college or to become more appealing to bigger organizations/ companies in your work force, having a job that is academic base will help. For example, going to coach my brothers soccer game during the weekends compared to going to a community center to fix computers during the weekends, wouldnt really open me up to more work opportunities rather than fixing computers at a community center will. Going to college isnt for everyone, but for many is the way to go. Maybe your going for your Masters or even a PHD, when you have a year you are saving the amount of extra time that you would be spending in school. Lets say for my PHD I would have to stay in school for 8 years, knowing that I have saved my self a year even though it doesnt seem like much compared to 8 years is not only saving time and money, but also saving a year to your age. Most student that go for the traditional 4 years typically are being rushed and become stressed out by the end. Colleges will also see that you have graduated showing them your were willing to work hard to get that extra year. Being able to graduate in 3 years doesnt only ask for patients but also for your dedication. Although you are graduating a year early, it doesnt neccisarly mean that the work load given in that year doesnt have to concern you. You would have to be able to manage your time and work hard to makeup for that year, yes, even if it means you have to give your summer break. Staying organized and knowing what your aim is, will give you more confidence making you become dedicated. Although some may argue that this is definitely something stressful and given 3 years is not enough for the workload in high-school, just know there is still hope. There are some student that dont have enough time to even finish in 4 years. So being thankful, you should know that it is alright if you cant finish in 3 years. Having this program gives opportunities to student but also saves time. School districts should label the students that have enough credits to graduate and for those that dont, and for those that dont, they should offer support (programs/ clubs) for them to possibly graduate in 3 years. If its not possible for students to graduate in 3 years then the 4th year should just be a less stressful year.",6,7,8,8,8,7,461,"conventions 7, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 6"

First of all, a problem can change your life. Oneday I was at walmert and Generic_Name was telling his story of the past. He said, I used to steal, tell lies, I didnt listen to anyone and I also didnt work. One day, we went on a family vacation, on our way back we got hit by a truck and I was the only one who surived in that accident. After that, I wanted to take my life, for I didnt see the reason of living anymore. Six months passed, and nothing was working in my life. Then oneday I went to the beach planing to take my own life he said, when I started walking toward the water I saw a man sitting in the sand. He asked me, who are , my name is Generic_Name I said, and I started telling the man my story. Then the man said, your life matters the reason why you survived the accident that night is because it wasnt your time yet, your life matters because you are still breathing said the man, that is a gift because there are people out there wishing they dont have machines helping them to breath. These words changed my life, he said, I didnt forget about my family but I fixed my life for the good. This evidence shows that Generic_Name used to steal, tell lies, didnt work and didnt listen to anyone, his family got into a care accident and he was the only one that surived, he wanted to take his own life but all that changed when he met a man at the beach who opened his eyes. clearly, a problem is something that can take your life to the next level. In addition, a problem can teach you. There was this man named Generic_Name, he was a faithful man he helped people in need with what he had, Generic_Name had eleven children, five boys and six girls. All his children were trained to help people in need. One day, something happened, a messanger came to Generic_Name and told him that his house was set one fire, and his children were in there. Everything that Generic_Name owned was destroyed, Generic_Name, who was Generic_Names wife, was not pleased with what happened. Generic_Names friends told him to repent maybe he did something bad to his God, but he said he didnt sin against anyone, his wife told him to curse God and he will die , but Generic_Name didnt. Oneday Generic_Name got really mad that he shouted at God and when he did that he remembered years ago, Generic_Name promised to give a family some food and kept saying I will give you some food I promised, but Generic_Name will always forget. The whole family died because of Generic_Name. When he remembered this Generic_Name asked forgiveness to God, and he forgave Generic_Name. Everything he had was restored. This evidence shows that Generic_Name lost everything he had, but at last he remmbered his mistake and asked for forgiveness. Clearly, we can learn from our problems. Inconclusion, a problem can be a chance for you to do your best because it can change your life and it can teacher to you. If you ever found yourself in a sitaution like Generic_Names remember your life matters and dont forget the promises you give to people because it can destroy your life.

Students can improve their grades in different ways they can do particularly activities like sports, if students do sports they can practice their beneficent for do activities after school. One important thing is that students can receive help from others students or teachers,a lot of students stay after school for receive help especially when they have missing assignments,if they do not understand a topic. Secondly,students can spend time with their friends, this is important because some students spend their time in technological things like phones,video games and things like that ,others students like to stay after school because they can share time,ideas or comments how they are in their grades,by sharing ideas they can help each other in their work,especially if they do not understand something. They can share and receive help from others they can do work together and when they finish they get free time for their friends. Thirdly, this is most important because students learn more,they learn the importance of share time with friends,a lot of people have longer friendship because they like to spend time with friends and they do not spend time with a phone. All the kids should do extracurricular activities in school because this can help then in a future,especially if they take importance to improve their grades. To conclude, every student should do activities after school,this is a benefit for their future and for their learning skills.

168,1795,14AC534FFE42,"graduating early is a very good idea but before start with my opioun or make any suggestions i would like to take sides first. graduating early comes with a lot of work and troubles . before you will be able to graduate early, you will need two math , two science ,two history and other elective subjects to graduate .but if you dont have any of that or maybe failed some classes in your freshmen year or sophomore year, its all pales up and wait for you in your senior year. or maybe you refused to go to summer school or even take some classes during the summer, its affect you in your senior year. summer school sometimes help you to reduce some classes during your school year. Every high schoolers"" dream is to walk on stage with a big smile on his/her face. but if you dont do the necessary part of passing your Sol and getting good GPA to college , you might as well want to stay and wait for your traditional four years. Many high school er""s sometimes want to leave high school and go to college because they want to live on their own, out from home,experience new things, meet new friends, or even meet new people and learn about other things and also sometimes too student graduate early or want to graduate early because they dont. like their school or get bullied a lot in high school due to that they try their possible best to leave the school before something happen to him/her. But from my point of view I think every high school er should wait till their traditional four years of high school because college can be very very stressful if you not well organized or you not well fit. And also before you make a decision to go to college or even work force or maybe start a life right after high school, make sure you are financially stable because college or anywhere else after high school will be very tough and very challenging. Preparing to graduate early and go to college a year early its very hard sometimes because you wouldnt know what you want do in college and you will be on a waiting list and you will have to pay for every semester which is going to be a waste of money and also time . so i think every high schoolers should wait till their traditional four years and be more prepared and financially stable before they graduate .

People can also hear what another student can up with in their own ways. Students can also correct themselves if they messed up on a word. Second, working in groups is another idea of working with partners. People can help one another if they are having trouble understanding something. I can also learn new things just by hearing what a student came up with. In a group we can also check each others paper to see what they came up with. We can all work together to come up with new ideas so that our paper makes sence. Third, by learning more we can get the hang of using that learn strategy. Coming up with new ideas to improve our writing. In group we can talk about each others paper if we think there should be a puncuation ore if a word is spelled wrong.

171,3617,E9705A9C0FE5,"In this prompt i agree and disagree, because in societies now in days some students do know for sure what career they want to study/become when older. Some students dont know exactly what they want to study/ become when older. It all depends on the student, For example if the student is for sure on what they want to be when older. Thats because either since they where little they have always like firefighters or a police officer. Once growing up they notice they can become one too and follow there dream on being something they have always loved since they where young. Also it could be that there Mom or Dad, or a family member that was or in the military or a firefighter. That want to follow those steps too, and make their family members proud. They also took interest on what their family member do or have done in life. Now for the student who are not sure of what they exactly want to be once their older/ study. Some students are actually not sure what they are interested in doing and need help finding what they would love to study about, or some students wants to explore and have options to see what they are most interested in doing for the future. Students who dont know for sure what they want to be when older , needs help finding their interest because most of the time their shy on going into a class with new people they dont know. Also in high school their are academy and sometimes the class you pick are not at the school you go to so a bus would take you to that school. And some students are scared to go to another school because they dont know that school so well. In other cases that i havent really heard of as much as the other ones, that they are scared to study what they love because they dont want to be judged by other people or also because their parents wants them to study to become a doctor or a lawyer when really they want to be a police officer or something else that they are interested in. So its hard for them to become what they really want to be in the future. I would agree and disagree in this prompt, i disagree because some students dont actually know what they want to be when older, and i agree because some students already know what they want to some as their career. Some are shy, some are scared, and some already know for sure what they want to study about. For example me, at first when i was little i didnt know what i wanted to be. my whole life till this day i am an animal lover. I rather live with animals then humans to be honest. So i thought of be a veterinarian, but people told me that i would have to do surgery on animals and stuff like that and at some things its good because i am saving their lives, but im not always going to save their lives so i didnt want to be a veterinarian because i didnt want to be hurt my whole life work like that. So i moved on to following my dads foot steps, becoming part of the Marine Corps. My dad was in the Marine Corps and fought in the Vietnam war, he also worked as security in the American embassy in Generic_City. I also love doing makeup, since i was little i would always play with makeup and growing up i would buy a lot of makeup but didnt really know how to use the products. until i started by little learning how to use the products. Now a big makeup store at the mall offered me a job their because they loved the way i do my makeup. Growing up i started seeing my interest and also had options on what i would like to do in the future. ",6,5,6,6,5,7,3395,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Not everyone has the same definition of success; Your vision of success might be their way of seeing failure. By setting your goals low, youre taking the potential risk of not attending the necessary capacities expected from you. When aims are set high, you are also sure to achieve your marks, have the pride of succeeding and be confident in what youre doing, this affects your mood too, therefore you are happy in how well you are doing, have the desire too do even better. The science fair is coming up this month; Doing a project on volcanoes sounds like a good idea, youre familiar with the subject and have done it before, teachers love projects that demonstrate real life actions, all though; This idea is unoriginal and five other students are thinking the same way as you are, by doing the volcano project, you would be aiming low, you must get out of your comfort zone in order to achieve your goals. Choosing another subject for your scientific project without being boring and using a real life causes would impress the judges, give them useful information without being too specific. By setting your aim too high you are taking a risk and could possibly fall short, but by aiming low you are closing the opportunities of going bigger and doing something you wouldnt normally do that could lead to potential Utopian future of yours.

We lives in one world that the opinions are more important or what others thinks about you, are more important because the constantly opinions from people that the only things they care about is their appearances, one of the first reason why is a biggest accomplishment try to be yourself and be individuality is that you need to appear how you are, do your own stuff, no matter what the opinions are. I am agree with the author of this prompt because is true that is a biggest accomplishment that everyday we have to tried to completed and do not do what others want you to do to make them feel better, or just do it for appear something that you are not, is good to be individuality and do your things by yourself and do not get influence with bad comments or opinions from others that are not satisficate with their personalities but is not easier to be strong in the world where the appearances has a big influences in the community.

174,1789,310CDA45739E,"Imagination is like thinking to do diet and go to gym to get slim. Knowledge is just like running on a treadmil for 2 hours in a weak to get your weight under 79. I believe that Imagination is more Important than knowledge, because when the writer writes a book, first they Imagine the topic for their book. They dont start to write the book unless they Imagine the topic. Same as, the writers Imagine what they want to write about, they dont just start to get Information about something, asking their parents what to write, how to write. They Imagine, then they start their work. However, Imigination is also similar when you think with your sister to convince your mom to get you lots of candy. You dont ask your dad, how to convice mom to get candy. For example, the person who get the idea to Invent phone, frst he Imagine, what does phone look like, how many buttons should be there, and then he also get help with his knowledge but first he Imagine what does phone look like, how will people buy this, why should they buy my phone. Also If we use knowledge more than Imagination, the new generation will only use the cell phones to search for their homeworks. They will not Imagine to do homeworks or other things by theirself. They will just copy someones idea, which is going to demolish their brains. There will be no more good inventions, The peoples brain will stop working. Also, people will not do their work because they know they can just copy someones idea. For example, If I dont Imagine that when I will be 16, how I am going to get a job. What If I just go to Youtube and search for it, but I will not find anything and I will waste my Important time. Incase if I imagine what kind of job I want to do or where I want to do, I am pretty sure that It will not waste my time. Infact It will give me some ideas for future. In my opinion we should imagine more than using knowledge. Imagination keeps your brain work and It also keeps you active. If we dont use imagination then how our new Inventors will Introduce their creative inventions. If the stylists doesnot use their imagination then how we are going to wear brautiful clothes. If they use just knowledge and dont use their imagination, I guess they will not get that much success in their buisness. Designers use their minds to help with their clothes design. They imagine the ideas for clothes, so the people will buy more and more clothes from them. The people who use Imagination more than knowledge live longer. From now I will also use imagination as more as I can. So I will give an opinion to all of you who are reading this use your imagination than knowledge and get success in your work. I dont say that using knowledge is a waste of time, use your knowledge also but not all the time, also use your mind to imagine good, Intresting things. In conclusion Imagination is more Important than knowledge. So, I will agree with scientist Albert Einstein. I will also force you to think about this. Writers, designers , Inventors all uses their Imagination more than knowledge. Now I will also try to focus on my Imagination more than focusing to copy others information.

175,280,009BCCC61C2A,"positive attitude is the key to success. I agree because you can do anything as long as you put your mind and soul into it and motivation you can accomplish it. Then so by doing it you feel good about yourself youll feel unstable. But do what brings the best in you, what makes you yourself. One way that importance of attitude is key to success is it motivates you to keep going forward. For example when you come across some difficulties you wont feel discouraged because your the limit and none other then you can or will change it. But the more discouraged you tend to feel at that moment you would wanna overcome it even if it makes whatever just as long as your mind is set to positive attitude you will accomplish it. Then so always remember what you put your mind to such as determination, positive attitude, willing you can its possible you will reach your goals. However you will with a positive mindset have a strong determination and you will build up self confidence in yourself. Then another reason is to grow individually with hard work. Positive attitude isent quite the easiest for some people its really difficult for others to learn how to or even if they are willing to. But others tend to not always have positive attitude in anything theyre just negative and havent tried to give their all they are stuck upon what others think. Then about what really is,you just have to not listen to what anyone thinks and focus on what you can accomplish because if you dont you will let them reflect on you but you dont want that for yourself. Then theres always going to be that one negative person to try to bring you down its up to you if you let it effect you. Just ignore them if you dont you will bet it affect you and you dont wanna fall back just because of others. With that being said in order to move forward you have to go though things individually but thats were you find yourself again and makes you stronger then before what your weaknesses were there not anymore because when facing things individually you blossom to a beatifull flower with of course hard work and it isent in vane because hard work ends up having a good result for positive attitude. Next reason is to build selfcondifence. When having a positive mindset and most impotently willing we then build selfcondience our mind is a battlefield and we control it and its not about the selfcondicence its more about determination ourselves to it like we can or we will do it. After that its all depending on us weather we want to or not. Then after that the more we practice being positive in our battle fild the more selfcondidence we will have. So then i hardly agree on positive attitude can guide you to succeed in life its all about three things determination willing and believing with those in mind you can tell all the negitive thoughts to go flying out the window because it has no door to let it in anymore.

Yes, imagination is more important than knowledge because its letting your brain think more about the things that make you happy the most. Also imagination is like thinking outside of the box (to me), but I try using imagination a little more than knowledge. Although knowledge is not as good, but some people prefer knowledge instead of imagination. Imagination helps me become more creative and open to myself because I let myself imagine, then let my mind speak free and be creative. Becoming more creative and open is really good, knowledge does not give me the opportunities to do so. Knowledge does not let me be as more creative as when Im imagining, therefore I have to start imagining. I think that imagination is a better way of saying art, because Im thinking of things that may not even exist in this world. In that case, imagining is creative, artistic, and beyond, so that is why imagining something is better than knowledge to me. Imagination makes me passionate about what I want to do and accomplish it. Ive always dreamed of opening my own interior design company. That designs furniture,planing notebooks for office workers, etc, that are for houses, offices, and dorm rooms. All of that was because of imagination, I wanted to accomplish that when I graduate from college. Imagination doesnt just help me with what I want to accomplish it also helps me decide what I want to be when I grow up. Otherwise imagination wouldve not gotten us to where we are right now. Finally, Imagination is something that brings people together like art and creative things. It also brings us joy and things that we dont really imaging on our daily bases. Although, knowledge is not important than imagination I still think that Knowledge can be used in someway and help me with something.

182,900,E0BDF62838F7,Hey have you been asked to teach a group of elementary students a lesson? well you have been chosen to teach a group of students a lesson and the lesson was multiplying and dividing because it will teach how add and subtract quickly. The 1st example is like going to a grocery store and dont know how much does 4 bags of chips cost for the party your going to well multiplying can help you figure out the cost. The 2nd example for dividing can help you figure out if you have a discount you can find the new cost and how much money you saved. Final reason is like multiplying and dividing fractions like 1/2 times 2/3 that would equal 2/6 and dividing that by 1/2 will equal 2/3 because if you add that is would be 3/5 and subtracting that by 1/3 would be 2/2 which is 1. So in conclusion multiplying and dividing can help you get answer more fast than adding and subtracting over and over.,6,6,5,5,6,6,3206,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
183,2314,A38A3B76558A,"Nowadays, the majority of students in high schools do not think about their future for many factors: time, dedication, or buget. Schools are a very important tools to help students to realize how important is to to commit to a career at a young age, because It is something that will help them for their future. It is a good idea for many reasons: prepares students as a future adults, keep them focus in their goals, and It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. One important reason, is to prepare students as a future adults, because each person has a responsibility as an adult, and this a good skill for each student to learn and built a knowledge when they get to the point of being an adult. For example, at a young age like teenagers in high school are able to absorb new ideas and words everyday to built their knowledge, and have the ability to apply it in the future for their career. This is really important, because this will help to molding them as a future adults for the society. Also, It is a good idea to for students to commit to a career at a young age, because It keeps them focus in their goals. By selecting a career at a young age, students can be focus on what they want or what do they need to achieve it. For example, schools can provide vital information about the career students may select, depending on the course they like. How much is it cost, how long it may take, and do they need to know about the career. This is really important, and it can motivate students to follow their dreams, and strive to achieve their goals. In addition, It gives students the time to realize what could be the ideal career for them. Each person needs the time to know what could be the ideal career or job in order to keep foward. For example, if a student is in his or her first year of high school and she or he wanted to be a doctor, but it realized that now he or she wants to be a teacher. The student still has the chance to change its mind and can choose the career of becoming a teacher. That is why is really important to have the time to think about a career at a young age. In conclusion, commiting a career at a young age is really important, because it can help people focus in what they want to be. At a young age, shows the level of mindset of each person, and who wants to be succesful in life. Starting from a young age does not mean people have a final desicion, but it may be an idea in general that everybody should practice at a young age to not have struggles in future decisions, and it would be more easy to choose a specific career.",6,6,7,6,7,8,2191,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
184,944,DD474E5804C0,"Do you think students should work on assignments from school at home? In this prompt I will argue about how students can study from long distance, not all schools approve the current subject. If students were to study from home it would be difficult for them to understand what the assignment that is being asked to complete at certain time. The students should be able to afford a device which is necessary to study any subject. Attending classes from home can cause for students to be able to work more and do their assignments on time. Schools will not exist if students leave to study home which will make it hard for them to communicate with teachers when help is needed. Students would not meet each other or talk physically which would be awkward, can cause them to not trust each other if it comes to a project that needs to be done. Physical education would not be a class since everything would be on devices which is a conflict, which is needed to graduate. In many short word students will be gaining so much weight that theyll not be able to do certain sports they want or walk to their destination. Typing online or video conferencing is not easy if the person on camera is shy and doesnt like video conferencing which can be very often. Accessing to both subjects can not be trusted if the school will be monitoring every movement you take on your device. Testing online can be easy to cheat if the teacher is not around walking and watching what your doing. Students might not know many things but cheating and being sneaky are the two most known words we understand very well. In other words there are advantages to studying online, disadvantages online and it would be a big disappointment for students to fail almost every class that needs to be taken for graduation. If they have a job they will consider work their first priority instead of school. Students would not receive a scholar ship or diploma so that they can go to college and accomplishing the goal of having a better job. Some people say that school is very important for students, that theyll earn more money than their parents who probably dont have a well paid job and education. But I think it can benefit sometimes it can be a amazing idea for students to study home because they wont drop out of school. Students have different emotions that trigger them to want to leave school behind, since they start working more to pay bills that need to be paid each month. All students should go to school to focus on what they want to be in life or do. Physical experience is not the same as typing online or video conference. Knowing that students can succeed in different ways is not bad even so they will be expected to have any sort of education someday in the future. School is providing knowledge for those who pay attention to school and more. Believing you can do what you always dreamed of is a motivation that will help learn more about life and the way it works.

186,3528,BBB9D66F934C,So i think it we should do the four day school week here at Generic_School. Because here are one advantage and one disadvantage. The one advantage is that the student will get a three day week end. And then here is a another advantage is that the student would have enough time to finish their homework and project. And then for the one disadvantage is that the student would have a longer school day because they are adding the eight hour that we are going to miss for Friday school day. they would be dividing that eight hour of school for the four day of school that we are going to have. and then here is a another disadvantage like would the student who play sport have short practice because of this like if we do in real life would that actually happen. So here is my first reason why it is a good reason for this to happen because it would save the school a bunch of money on electric bill. And then here is another good reason that we should do this is that it would help the teacher teach to student understand the material a little bit better. And then here is second reason why it is a bad reason to do this and school like this will give student who play sport a short time to do homework at home because they have school then after school they have practice So in conclusion we should try this for a month and then after that month we can see if we should keep this thing going on for the rest of the school year. like we can ask the student if they want it to stay. Or we can back the regular secudule like we go the regular time that we get school and then we go back to the five day school week. like in my opinion we should try this out and see how this turn out like would most of the student like this or would most of them hate like i think this is going to be like a 50 50 chance of this working and not working. like i feel like most of the student would like and the rest of student hating this because the extending hour of the school day but the student who are going to love this is because of the three day weekend and then for the teacher they all would love this idea for the school year,5,5,6,5,6,5,2530,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

People dont conseve their energy and resources in the way that people get tired daily. Nonetheless, there are some businesses had the idea to work four days per week each day consistenting of ten hours. As well as, schools should follow this project by extending the school day two hours. In my opinion, school should follow this great idea because students can do differents routine, be less stressful, and get better grades. To begin with, the majority of students do the same rutine daily some enjoy to play sports on the school. Whereas, someone will like to try another kind of sport outside the school but they dont have sufficient time to do it. Elsewhere, if the school follow extending the school day and leaving one or two days off students can do different rutine and have thier own space. All in all, students can try different sports with their families or friends outside of school. In others words, doing differents routine will help the energy and resources for students. Second reason, for some students is stressful go to school everyday. As well as, some has to work to late, or do homework, or has problent to get sleep at night. If this happend during this time they loss their energy and is difficult for student to focus on their class. However, students that are stressful can have health problem. In other case, students can be less stressful and active if their sleep more such as, if they get two days off of the school they can repose their tiredness and get energy. Lastly, the energy and resources are a important priority for a student. Likewise, that all students do their homework and be on time in their class. nevertheless, the majority of the students has problem be on time or do homework some of them miss school days just because they didnt do their homework. Altogether, durin this days off students can do their homework with resources, patience and dedication. After all, this could help student to have better grades. To conclude, the priority for people life is to conserve energy and resouces. Rather, we are on time to help our studentss health. Lately, doing different rutine will help us to progress and be healthy. If we are healthy we are less stressful we will be with energy.

194,3195,1E11EA73C7B3,"Inactivity will most definitely not get you anywhere in life. By not giving up and always doing something, youll accomplish more in your lifetime. Youll learn a lot in the process, and youll also set a great example for others. Theres a good amount of people who are good at something in life, but never get the opportunity like others to be successful at it. For example, sports. If your good at sports nowadays, you can easily make it to the big leagues and have a good salary, if and only if, your focus and show that you want it more than others. You gotta be unique in someway. Because if you think your good enough already and sit back and think that theres no one better than you out there, then your wrong. That means your mentality is not set for success, its set for failure. If you decide to be Idle, youll lose your chance to make it to the big leagues because theres many people out there who are hungry and are willing to take that spot from you. For example, Ousmane Dembele, former Barcelona player, took the starting spot from Philip Coutinho. Because at practice and some games, Dembele showed that he had what it takes to start over Countinho. Coutinho did suffer an injury, but when he recovered, he pretty much became Idle and Dembele was already far ahead from what Coutinho was when he started. When you decide that you want to be successful, its not only good for you, but also for others. Because your setting a good example,for people that look up to you, younger siblings, etc. Id rather die trying to be successful, than not, because then I know I made someone happy, like my family. Trying isnt going to harm you, matter of fact, Itll get you somewhere in life where It will only motivate you to do more, and become a better person. A person like me, would never become Idle because ive witnessed what happens when a person becomes Idle. Especially High School students. Ive seen many students get jobs and lose their interest in school because theyve ""found"" an easy way to make money. And many think that they dont need education, thats why I, myself, havent had the interest to look for a job at the moment. I witnessed my cousin, get a job at Wendys, going from straight As and Bs, to becoming Idle towards school and finishing the year with all Fs and only one D. Thats why I encourage students not to get a job right away when they become 16 years old. I would rather wait for the summer, get a job, and make money. Because you cant also sit around and not do anything in the summer. Everyone gets to that one point in life, where theyll find themselves being Idle, but thats great because they learn from it. They learn whats bad from it, and hope to never be like that. At least Ive learned from it. I suffered a bad injury freshman year, which lead to my downfall a little bit because when I came back from the injury, I noticed that I wasnt the same anymore. My team mates were telling me that Ill most likely never be the same again and that another person was gonna take my spot. I took their words, and trained harder than ever. I became a better player than I was, took me a bit of time, but I got there. And that inspired me a lot, I even started playing with better people so that I could learn from them. I pushed myself out side of my comfort zone, but it payed off. I inspired my brother to also become a goalkeeper, he now trains with me every weekend. Thomas Jefferson states that by always doing something, youll accomplish more, and its a wonderful thing when people acknowledge that. I, in fact agree with him, because when youre Idle, you most definitely wont get anywhere in life. Theres always something to do out there, for every human being. You just have to push yourself outside of your comfort zone, and do things in life that makes you happy.

When people want to achieve their goal to be somone in life. Its like shotting a arrow to hit the middle, and aiming the goal we want. For example, to aim it at the middle you have to focus, believe, think, be positive, and let go of your arrow to aim your goal. Other people would like a better statement , and also a better example to go with it. There are mostly people that take it serious to aim for their goal to be success. However there are some other that dont really care and just try to aim for their goal, and ending up missing their shot towards the middle. Another example, is when people want to aim their goal they have to study , work hard, have faith, believe , take risk , be proud, and never giving up. But theres people that miss their one shot towards the middle. Because they are lazy, not prepared, not focus, negative, not giving effort, and not paying attention for what goal their aiming for , so basically they will end up missing their only shot. Third example, is people have to aim their goal just right not to high , and to low. The goal is to aim in the middle ,but Micheangelo is right in one part because you only have one arrow to make it th the middle. Its mostly saying you have one shot to aim for your goal without making any miskates. I could understand why Michelangelo said The greater danger for most of us is aming our goal target right in one shot. Because there are some people that would have to take some risks. For example, they are not a citizen , or they dont have any papers to work , dont understand english well, they have to leave love ones behind, and get discriminated by their colors. And it makes it more difficult for some people to aim for their goal. For those reasons theirs fewest peoples that end up missing there shot. But there are other peoples that wont let this get in their way by taking the risk , and some of those risks come worth it at the end. For example , there are some people that get discriminated by how they look and their color ,but doesnt mean that they have to give up ,and point their arrow the wrong direction to miss their shoot to success. They have to show the others people that they can make their one shot towards the middle all because they study, work hard, put effort, being prepared, being positive and never giving up. These are my supporting details ,and reasons why i agree with Michelangelo the artist statement. However, I dont think that this is statement is the most greatest danger for all of us. For sure theres others statement that are more dangerous then this one.",5,5,7,7,6,7,3287,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
196,1594,A0B2BF94231C,"First impressions are almost impossible to change. I disagree because when you look at a person for less than 6 seconds you think you know that person. Until you have a coversation with that person at least for ten mintutes. Your impression will change. However i disagree that first impressions is almost impossible to change. The reason why is that the way a person looks,personality, and their communication skills are always that change your whole point of view of that person. From your first impression, when you look at them. However the way a person looks from your first impression isnt always who they really are. Your observation on someone arent truely who they are. The person can be good looking person youve ever seen and you really want to meet them. Until they are the wost person, that you hate so much. This also works the other way around too, the person could be the ugliest person you have ever met, but you never gave them a chance. Thats when you realize that, that person is really good. Its also like dont judge a book by its cover. Until you actually meet that person and get to know them. Personality can change your first impression. Personality is mostly who you are finding out, who that person is, can be life changing. For you not knowing who someone is can have a big change for you. You really dont know who you are really meeting. Personality gives great insights in that person and who they really are. Also however they want to come out to you. Also communication is key its really important to have communication. Communication gives confidence to the other person who you are communicating with. That shows that you understand the other person and feel comfortable with them. Having good eye contact and hearing all the information of the conversation that they are giving you, makes them open more up to you. Additionally, i disagree that the first impression is almost impossible to change. Their personality, the way they look, and communication skills can always change your whole point of view on a person. Looks can be looks, personality being honest no matter what. Communication skills are you by listening, can help you on your first impression. Therefore by taking the time, day, hours , and effort to get to know someone can benefit you from not judging a book by its cover. First impressions can change ,by getting to know that person and who they really are. ",8,7,7,8,7,8,2150,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

In my personal life, I used to assist to a barbering career, I learn the basics. This had help me to cut some people hair by this I earn some extra money while I am In High School. Any career is hard but is vital in life. I believe that it is a good idea for students to join a career in a young age because they gain more experience, students can work in a young age. These are two major things why they should participate, sooner Ill explain it. Students could gain more experience in a particular career. This is because the brain still fresh and is perfect to learn new things. Teenagers would be able to learn new things everyday. They can learn how to solve a simple thing, for example at home with electrical or mechanical issue. Furthermore, students could be able to be masters in the future of any career. They could be experts because they will have a longer period of time to practice and keep finding stuff to learn. If a person have experience they can even become managers. A career would help to find better jobs. sometimes people see careers as a waste of time but, if a person go to a job with a career taking;that person is able to earn money. If a person have experience they can even become managers. Besides, students are able to work in a young age. They could work in summer break.

199,1638,9CB6D9467227,"I agree that a positive attitude is the key to success in life because people are Motivated , Happier and Work harder. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude doesnt mean anything and others think it makes a huge impact in success. Many studies have shown that having a positive attitude helps people succeed better and is a key. First, I truly believe that if you really stay motivated and Im convinced that I want to be successful, I continue to push myself each time I want to give up. When I pay attention to the certain things I want to achieve. I give dedication when I want one specific thing and try not to worry about other things that arent related to what I want or succeed. I try to stay as focused as possible because once Im determined and make that my main focus, then Itll make me want to keep my positive energy towards my goal. Secondly, If I want to have a positive energy I must remain Happy. If I truly believe in myself then I will continue to have a positive energy, but even if I dont believe in myself I will remain to have a positive energy and a positive attitude. By succeeding with a positive attitude I must prioritize my goal making it my first reason to stay positive and to work harder. Keeping it always in my mind and reminding myself; for example "" oh this is what I have to look for"" or ""this will help me by succeeding my goal I want to achieve"", those two examples are ways to bring it to my mind all the time and remember what I need to be looking for. Thirdly, If I work harder by putting my all into it and dedicating my time and keeping my positive energy then thats one way i can always succeed. By keeping my energy positive and succeeding I will make work twice as much as I need to for my goal to come true. If I know i truly want that goal and what to succeed I wont give it up that easily because that will be my main focus and my main priority. Having a positive attitude is a huge key to succes because people get motivated, happier and work harder for what they are trying to achieve in life. Many people disagree that having a positive attitude is a key to success and others think its a huge difference when you do because thats peoples main focus in life. Always have a positive attitude for the things a person including yourself may want in life! ",5,8,7,6,7,6,2089,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 5"

This will make the students feel about their seld beacuse they were helping other younger students. Now the srudents feel more comfortable beacuse they got helped from the other students from the other students so now the younger students feel way happier beacuse they know where to go. And if this was not a thing students will be all sad and fustrated beacuse they will be all lost beacuse they new to the school and wont have no one to help them. The younger students going to be really sad beacuse they wouldnt know what to do and what class they have to go. So this a reason of why every older students should help new kids at the school or any younger students.

201,403,9C601D9FCB5F,"Technology is an important thing in our lives at this moment and it will be more important in the future. Humanity always try to look forward for what is better for our lives and make everything more easier. While some people say this is a good thing, some people think its bad for our lives because people stop interacting face-to-face in public, they dont want to get out of the place where technology is at, and some might have an agressive behaivor when they told them technology is bad for them. In the past people always met in the street, there was no technology were with a single ring we can saw our friends into a little screen and talk to them. Now, this problem became a bad thing in our society, people dont go outside to meet friends, or just enjoy how the city looks, they prefer to stay at home and talk to people that they dont know who they are. Some of these people might say that theres no difference when they talk to a stranger online because we used to talk strangers in the street;however, theres a risk when you talk to this people online and its the fact that some of them used fake accounts to hack personal information and other things. When we used to meet strangers in the street, we saw how they behave and what theyre doing, and thats how people made friends in the past, saw how they act and behave,but now Internet is the key of making a friend that we dont know if its real. When we were kids it was all fun to play outside: in the streets,going to a friends house, or even going to the park with them, but now things have change a lot since we were those kids who played in the streets. Now with the new technology people made video games, and now is the popular thing between kids and teenagers. All we have to do is to connect the device to the TV and just play, but some people play the whole day and they dont want to go outside to play any sport, or going to a friends house. When they go to school the most common topic between every kid is about video games, and that can affect their lives because playing all the time wont help anyone to study for an important test,or doing their homework. In the past when they created the first console it was a wonderful thing, but some kids didnt have the enough money to buy it, so instead of save money for a tiny console, they save money to eat something like an ice cream, a burguer, and go to attraction parks,but now we can see how the kids and the teenagers from now dont want to get out where technology is at. Due to the amount of technology we have now develop, a new behaivor where if we prohibited them to use technology, they reach to the point where they become agressive. Families have issues when their kids became agressive just because the prohibited the use of technology, and this reaction is trendy right now in different parts of the world. Some doctors said that the reason why they react like that is because they are in an imaginary world where they can do whatever they want, until the parent try to take apart their""world"" to become a normal kid, but now that technology is in every single corner, its hard to make a kid stop use technology. Even teenagers went to a ponit when they are playing video games they break everything they got on their sight, including the video game device that their parents bought for them. Some people might say that technology is something positive in our live because we create artifacts that make our lives more simple;however, technology is bad in our lives because we stop acting like normal people and we want to make our lives more easy, and that can affect how our saciety can be in the future if we dont control the use of technology.",7,6,7,6,5,6,2081,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
202,1738,7F4706C105DE,Do you agree with Churchill statement about the important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success? Yes because in order for you to be successful you have to fail a couple of times. For an example when I was 10 years old I lived in Miami Florida and I played football. Every kid I went up against they were faster than me and better and I got mad because I was not good enough. One day the coach pulled me after practice and told me whats up this is not the kid I saw play football in Miami Beach. He then matched me up with the best receiver he had and I still didnt surprise him with that kid he saw on the beach. After a while of training and training back to back coach then matched us up again now I was faster and better it got to the point where I was his star receiver that season we finished 10-0. We went to playoffs and finished 5-0 coach was really happy in 10 years of coaching he had never achieved something like that with his football team. But it was the final game everything changed the team we went up against had stronger and bigger players they first took out are running back with a neck injury so that left me playing two positions. We were up 21-7 its second half 2 minutes before half and next thing you know I had both tight ends and safety hit me at the same time both tight ends hit me in my knee and I was done. What hurt the most was seeing my coach not being able to concentrate he had then even left the special team coach run the plays all because coach went to check on me. He asked the doctors was I okay and they said he is done he cant play neither can he walk. After that coach went outside mad he was really mad and he then saw the score board it said 28-7. We were still up than theres the halftime coach talks to the players even I did so and they go back on the field we are on the 40 yard line and next thing you know boom are star quarter back is hit. He is not getting up his spine was broken and he could not even move after that coach knew we lost the game but coach did not know that i was feeling better without coach knowing i went back on the field the score is 28-28 theres 30 second left and the ball is on the 50 yard line. Coach starts to see the formation he than knew I was on the field and he tried calling timeout but there was no time out left coach knew I could throw but the team did not know my friend Ricky is running he cuts back and runs back up the field as fast as he can I throw the ball he catches it on the 10 yard line and he gets the touchdown coach than ran on the field and picked me up. Coach then said how did u manage to hold in all the pain after being hit like that I told him the same way my brother managed to cover me when there was a drive by and he was shot 9 times. Coach knows I came from a rough spot in Miami especially the projects. Now i am 17 and i learned from my passed i learned from being a failure for you to be able to be great you gotta fail no matter what nobody is perfect. My brothers always told me if you eat okay now you will eat better tomorrow it is a saying just about being able to actually grind and stay humble. sometimes in life things will not always be easy because that is just the way things are and i personally will be better from yesterday. How do you think all the star people from now and days have so much money they were not good from the jump they failed a lot in life nothing will never come easy to be great you gotta beat the great. Football players dont just get to be star just like that they gotta earn it. Rappers dont get to get platinum just like that they gotta make good songs. Everything in life is a sacrifice you gotta humble yourself and be able to go out and get it because nothing will be bought to you. you can feed a horse but you cant force them to eat it. ,8,6,7,7,7,6,1678,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

I dont think working from home is a good idea for school students. There are some kids that cant really work at school, but then theyre others that just do it for fun. By saying how kids take advantage is because some of them would do their ""school work"" from home but it would end up with them just sleeping and doing their work later.

Thing out in the world are not like they used to be. A city council is debating on a curfew adoption. If this curfew is adopted does this mean teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Will curfews keep teens out of trouble or unfairly interfere with their lives? A city council is debating on an adoption of curfew for teens. Why are they debating about this adoption? The first reason is city council does not want teens getting hurt or putting themselves at risk at a young age. Second, they want to keep teenagers safe from the bad things out in the world. Lastly is they do not want trouble, some teens make bad choices about drinking and other stuff they should not do at a young age. That is why city council is debating a curfew adoption. If the curfew adoption is adopted by city council, does it mean that teens on the street after hours are breaking the law? Many people have different opinions. I also think it depends on why they are out. I would say they are not breaking any law if its for work or any emergency. They are also not breaking the law if they are with an adult because it is not like they are on their on there own. However if they are out to be hanging out with friends and partying stuff like that, yes the would be breaking the law. Does this mean if teens are out they are breaking the law? In some ways yes and in some ways no, it depends on why they are out pass the curfew. Do curfews keep teenagers out of trouble or unfairly interfere in young lives? First things first most teens would say that by having the curfew law its interfering with there lives. Teens would say that because they want to go out and have funny and other stuff. having the curfew law will keep teens safe and out of trouble because you never know what could happen. Another reason i would say keeps them out of trouble is because most teens like to leave the house at night with out their parents knowing. That is never something you should do. Teens should think, Is it worth the risk? A lot of things can happen even though you may think everything is okay and that nothing will happen, but that is what you think there might be a chance you could be wrong. Now teens should think, Do curfews keep them safe or does it interfere win there lives? The city councils debate about the adoption of curfew for teenagers. Many believe it should be a law and others believe its should not be a law. They debate upon this law because they want to keep teens safe and do not want them to get hurt or in trouble at a young age. Will it mean that any teen on the streets after curfew is breaking the law? It Will probably depend on why they are out for example for work or for and emergency and unless they are with an adult. Some reasons other than that like to go to parties or hang with friends, is most likely breaking the law. Will this law keep teens out of trouble or interfere with there lives? Most teens opinions would be that this law is interfering with their lives.

207,1451,35954693FE8E,"High school, the most perfect time to plan for the future. In some societies, students are required to identify a career by the time they enter high school. The high school will select courses for students to guide them toward the career they are considering. Some people say that it is not a good idea to identify career at high school because students are not ready for entering the adult world. While other people say that it is a good idea because it helps students to plan for their future. To me, I believe that knowing what am I going to do is important. Once people have their goals, they can plan and prepare for their futures. How can people plan for their futures? By thinking about the careers they want to enter, they might also think about what are the things they like to do. They could choose the careers that are the most interesting to them and the perfect colleges base upon their interests. Also, people can have more time to work on their dream such as search more information, meet basic requirements, and get advises from their counselor. Therefore, when people are ready to go to the college, they wont be confusing about what to do. Because they have their goals with them. What about prepare for the future? Well, some schools will provide courses that will fit to students the most. If the students identified their careers, they could do better at studying the related objects in college than those who havent think about that thing at all. Because the students know what they want to be, they can choose to take related courses to learn the knowledge they might use in college courses for their career. Some people can even save thousands of money just by taking AP courses which will give them the credits that college will accept. Some may argue that it is too early for students to think about their future by the time they enter high school. They have plenty of times to do that during their senior year. However, if students dont know what are they going to do after high school, they will have no idea about which college is the best for them and what career they want to have. By considering and taking the courses in high school, people could get to know the career and decide whether or not they want this career. It is better to change your mind in high school than in college. Because by that time, people will waste their money and time to change their majors. Anyway, identifying your career when you are entering high school is a really good idea. You can choose the courses that are perfect for you and your career and also be ready for college since you have your goal already. Therefore, high school is a perfect time to think about the future. It is the entry to the adult world. So dont just doing nothing but waiting for someone else to help you to decide, after all, we have to choose our own futures right?",9,7,7,8,7,8,696,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Positive attitude is more effective in the job, because we have to believe in our self for example; Generic_Name is working in a company they have a big project and everybody say This is too much we cant do this all this is wrong but Generic_Name say all is possible in a teamwork, is very effective if all the pieces are good nothing cant be wrong Generic_Name always have good attitude and is that why the boss always say go and ask for help to Generic_Name. A person with positive attitude is a support, for example: Generic_Name have a big problem, but Generic_Name have a friend and her friend is her support, because with somebody is in problems need friends with good energy positive attitude. People with positive attitude always have good friends, because they listen that problems and them say All is going to be fine just wait for the right time. My mom always say Believe in God and be positive. After the rain the calm come. All the people say In the life all have to be positive because if i have to do something and i do my best with my best attitude, im going to be fine with the result, because i give everything. For example: Generic_Name want to be part of the marine she love the Marine, but her parents said is too much difficult is impossible for youa but Generic_Name have positive attitude. The positive attitude always is going to be the key to success in life, because it is the base of everything all the peoples have to believed, is dosent matter what other people say or do, because in the future the only responsible for the things is going to be you nobody also. In the life that people have to show the better face and smile and say everything is possible,but no only said, that people have to believe that. All the people have to put a positive attitude and their job, school, home and in the general life and are going to be the things change. sometimes in the life that people need a push and a person with positive attitude can be that push.

209,3705,194E86ED4117,"My dad usually told me that failure is the mother of success when i was young. Way to success is not easy, everyone had to face different kinds of problems. It will fell harder and harder every time you failed, and its hard to keep up the enthusiasm while facing different kind of problems. Yes, im fully agree with Mr. Churchill. Failure lead you to success. Simple example about Elon Musk, one of the richest people on planet Earth. He was the Chairman of PayPal, Tesla. At 2002 he invented SpaceX, first ever self-investment rocket company to reach the Earths orbit. Also, most amazing thing is they invented the reuse rocket, which is the rocket will land back to earth after launch to the Earths orbit. SpaceX has accomplished so many that people talk about their success so much without remember their failure. Let me tell you this: The first 2 of their rocket(Falcon 1) launch are all failure due to engine failure. after during a other year of researching, testing, and examine, the 3rd rocket launch still failed to reach the Earths orbit. At that time everyone think this project is a jock and Elon only have the money to launch the 4th rocket. Without losing hope and years of hard work, their 4th rocket(Falcon Launch 4) was successfully launched and reach the Earths orbit. Elon and SpaceX made history, SapceX also received a large amount of money by NASA. Dont ever lose your enthusiasm(Hope). Dont Never Ever Give Up, one of the greatest quote of all time, it lead so many people to success. Like Elon Musk i talked about last paragraph, he is a great example for us. His enthusiasm and passion about Space transpiration in the future and even moving people to space lead him and his company into success. Im a sports athlete, i play basketball for 5 years already, its part of my life. Every athlete knows practice is boring but also important. Why so many people still play professional basketball is because they have the passion and enthusiasm about winning. Process is boring and long, however it only take one moment for sports athlete to fell everything is worth it. Still some people failed on their way, beat by the tiredness of the process and slowly lose their enthusiasm for what they are chasing for at the beginning. Failure complete the adventure, last thing im going talk about today. Everyone is emotional, everyone hate losing, everyone wanted to take the short cut. Im the everyone, you are the everyone too, but without the gaps on the road to success, the adventure just seems not complete. Every failure make the explorer more stronger and smarter. Learn from the mistake, take note from it and you will be step ahead from everyone else. Every person on this planet with big accomplishment also have big mistakes too. No one is perfect, just go do thing what you want or like to do, eventually the journey will become interesting. All for all, guess you already tired of reading. i support my 3 main points: Failure lead you to success, dont ever lose your enthusiasm, failure complete the adventure. Im also agree with Mr. Winston: success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. Failure does play a important role in the pursuit of success.",7,6,8,8,6,7,339,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

When I see the other girls with there uniform am I just look away that just makes me fell like dam I should be on the team.

However, not everyone agrees with this position,because cell phones can effect students health such as eyes problems if students look at it for a long time. And it can get students interest about games or social media or app for chatting. Additionally, there might be support for this idea that cell phones can help students to search on things or information that they are looking for in class. Also cell phones can help students easily to contact with their friends at school or to call their parents in an emergency situations. Ultimately, this argument cannot stand because cell phones can effect students scores, students might be missing something important in the class while playing with cellphones. It seems like nothing but cellphones can destroy students future. The reason this idea is fallible that students cannot focus on class if they are using cell phones in the classroom. Given these points, students might be get addicted to cell phones and cell phones will became a bad habit for students. One possible solution to this issue might be using cell phones only for an emergency problems or education problems. some students that can control the limit of using cell phones.

231,803,00ED2563D0B1,"Philosopher, physician, and humanitarian Albert Schweitzer once said "" Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I strongly agree, imagine you being the reason why a person decided to make a remarkable change in there life just by following your footsteps, imagine how that would make you feel. Setting a good example everyday is one of the most important things you can do in life; you dont know who is watching you, and you dont know who is getting an impact from your good ways. People watch others every move and learn new and better things as time goes so they can also turn out to influence others. Consider yourself as a leader being able to influence people is a leadership movement, everyone needs someone to help them and guide them through things they may not tell you, but theyll watch your examples and learn. Many may think that there are better ways unlike setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others; but little do they know that setting an example by your behavior is the best way to influence others. Setting good examples is helpful in so many ways however; there are other ways to influence others. People get influenced on anything these days, just sitting around and watching TV can influence you to do something. But think about it would you rather have someone set examples for you, and have someone you can watch to motivate you and guide you; or would you rather sit around and procrastinate on time?. As the influencer having people look up to you and following the way you move is a big deal. For example when surgical interns first go to a hospital to work they look up to their head surgeons. The head surgeons set examples for the interns because they want them to be successful, the intern watching the head surgeon during operations and check ups influences and motivates them to do better and be better. Even for school students thats how they all learn from examples the teachers show them, it influences the students to try so they can also be good at what their teaching is teaching them. Some people may prefer to get influenced in another way because they may not want someone by them step by step they may be more independent and like to be on there own. Having good behavior benefits you in a lot of ways, you will get a lot of opportunities, help and inspire a lot of people and gain a lot. For example parents have a good influence on there kids. They are the reason why there kids wake up and try every day, seeing your parents have a good and positive behavior will motivate and influence you to do better. As you go on with good behavior people will see you and begin to know that there is something your doing to be happy. You will have people come around you because of your vibe and good energy. Once they start talking to you you automatically begin to influence them to be a better person. Knowing that you are a motivator and an influence onto others is a good feeling. You will know that your good work and good behavior has a good effect strong enough to influence others in the best way possible. Overall setting a good example by your behavior is the best way to influence others, they learn better, feel comfortable and get to experience a lot. Having someone look up to you as a good influence will help you both because it will make you both feel great and you both will benefit from it in the long run. We have people around us for a reason, if you have someone that is willing to help you and influence you to be better in life take the chance because it will be a great experience and you will change as a person once you get influenced in the right way by the right people in life.",7,6,7,7,7,8,14,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
232,2174,6CD1B8B6BEA8,"Should people make there own decisions, or should they seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters? No people should not make there own decisions because sometime people need more opinions with thing they do. Like if they want to watch a move they can ask others on what to watch and they can help you out. Some people will say its your life do what you want, make your own decisions but it is not that easy. I feel like sometime its better to get guidance from other people, like my parents or older siblings because they are older and have been through some of the thing I have gone through. Sometimes things get hard in life and you are going to need help, we all as people need someone in life to help guide us through thing that may be bad.

235,1430,876DD6D022A9,"Do you feel confident comes from achievement or for praise? People are concern about the students must be self-confident in order to learn and other thinks that self-esteem come after you achieve something. People might think a lot of things but this is my opinion; to achieve something you have to be full of self-confident. Some examples could be people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while, people have to be confident and positive in order to get something done, and confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. Succeeding in something is a great achievement but if there is no confident how can you be sure what you. First, people have to have self-esteem in order to work hard and learn new things every day or once in a while. For instance, there are some jobs like a doctor they never stop learning new things because at some moment a new disease will appear and new medicine will developed. Learning a new language, being someone who knows Spanish and want to learn English is pretty hard. Why? Some words might mean the same as the do in English but all of them do. One word in English might mean five different words in Spanish and some words arent even similar. You will never gonna to achieve to learn the whole language no even the native can but you will build a confident inside yourself knowing that you will never going to be done with it but you will be learning everyday new words. Secondly, you have to be confident and positive in order to get something done. For example, anger doesnt let someone to concentrate and it lead to chaos. When the final days of school comes and the exams and SOL arrive slowly and you are feeling unprepared for it. The confident that you put yourself every day to come to school even if you feel bad is the one who will keep all your information and it will help you in your nightmares that is those big tests. If you study for a long time then when the time arrives, you will feel ready to pass it. Thirdly, confident is feeling sure about what you are about to do. When trying to find a new job at any place but you dont know how is going to be like or how they are going to receive you. You have to be sure about yourself and letting your confident falls over your fears because with fear nothing is possible. Because you wont have any clue about what is going to happen in that first meeting and those people who will hired you have to feel like you are really to do the job. They wont choose you if they feel you are not really and no have confident to do well the job. However other people think that self-esteem come from achievement. To begin with by achieving something, you are getting what you fought for and self-confident come as the result. For example, achieving something is no that easy. You have to make a mix of all the things you have to include to get it. When you are at school, it is so easy for old people to think that students just have the obligation of going to school and nothing more at all. Studying its not just passing classes but its about learning things for the next day. SOL is a good example of it; teachers prepared us for about eight months to pass a test that is no that long, the problem is that its not just one SOL but many of it no including the exams. The satisfaction of telling yourself that it is over and summer is coming, there are no more worries about next day because you have fought for eight months to pass it. When you pass something, you achieve it somehow. But what if the SOL is failed twice wont that prejudice your next year. Secondly, after achieving something, usually that person feels joyous for the reality that its over. For example, if you study so hard for the driving test the night before and feel like you know you are going pass it. Thats happiness in yourself but what is you fail, all the effort for the last night is not over yet because you have to do it again until you pass it. Lets pretend that you pass it in the first try, well, you achieved it and you are happy because its over and now you are getting closer to get a car and drive by your own. Your confidence will grow high because if you did it at a first try then you can do anything that you feel afraid of. Lastly, a positive person is someone who is full of joy and feels confident for what it wants and its there to fight until its achieve it. For instance, in all the world there are always different kinds of people: positive and negative. Learning a new job its so frustrate because at the beginning you wont have any idea on what you are doing. Positive people always think that everything will go right and they tell themselves that they will end up knowing this job like their own hands. Why? Because they have confidence that they can do anything if they fight for it. Nobody was born with the intelligent to get something form the beginning. When you are learning to walk for the first time, you fall and fall until your knees get red and even end up with blood but after all that effort comes the realize that now you dont depend on them to get something because now you can do it by your own. Believing in yourself is feeling confident. However I still believe that confident have to come before the achievement because confident is courage that every person put itself into his or her heart to full-fill the fear. As previously stated, things cannot be achieve if there is no confident on it. People need self-esteem in order to function at work and keep learning, the confident and positively that is in every person will make possible for them to get things done, and confident is a feeling of courage that makes the fear goes away. My solution is to have confident in yourself. Make the confident to cover your fear and be sure what you are doing. If something is achieved then the fear will go away and the confident will stay forever. Hope you enjoy this and it will be helpful for your day.

However,most parents disagree with having their children ride bikes and skateboard. Most parents think that their children are going to get abducted,raped,kidnapped or get hurt. Some parents also think is a good idea for their to children to skateboard and ride bikes outdoors,so they can cope with talking to people. Well I think is a bad idea for children to ride and skateboard in the Summer alone without parental guidance, because it takes a lot of training and focus to bike ride or skateboard. Some people can even scuba-dive if they have the experience. Most people like to spend time outdoors,for example,they can invite some friends over for some barbecue.

If parents stay outdoor with their children on a campsite,they could make smores with a campfire and enjoy.

Yes, students should commit to a career at young age mostly because always a good idea to start earlier than later. In addition this gives more time for preparation and being able to learn more about the career of your choice by selecting electives in highschool that are in that field of study of the career you wanna pursue.

Its a smart way and fun way to go deeper in the career you want and learn more from it and have it help you in the future. Commiting early on is key to being more successful in that career and for your journey to that career. Secondly, commiting to a career at a young age is useful to build up confidence in that student so they have the urge to want to pursue that career and be more serious about what they wanna do. Most students dont take their career selections seriously until senior year or until they graduate highschool. Another reason is that if youre confident in what you wanna do youll be able to achieve your goal. For example i wanna become an athletic trainer/fitness instructor and i am taking the fitness instructor class next year for my senior year to prepare and learn more about what i wanna do. They also offer a test at the end of the year to certify you as a fitness instructor so i am confident in taking that test and still expand my study at college because i believe and i really wanna have this as a career. Lastly, If you commit to a career early enough you can start working as part time for that career for example, after highschool and if i pass the fitness instructor class and get certified as a fitness instructor i could apply for a part time job at a gym or something related to that and help others out to reach their goal. While i would still go to college to expand my learning in althetic training having a part time job in doing what i love would be great. It could also help out with expenses and anything else.

239,1333,B68C62AB1515,"Careers are a big part of a persons life. People can choose from thousands of careers that interests them. Careers usually tell a persons personality. A lot of people take careers very seriously and want to know more about careers. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like, they will find something fun to do everyday, and they wont have to worry about it in their adult lives. Students committing to a career at a young age is a good idea because students will know what a career is really like. Some students lack information about becoming a doctor. Students often dont know what it is like to become a doctor, or know the basics. In order for students to obtain information and knowing how to treat a patient, they need to experience it physically. It is a good idea for students to take action in a career because they will get more information about it. In addition to knowing what is like to become a doctor, students can look up a career they want to know more information about. For example, if a student wants to know more information about dentistry, they can easily research what do you need to do to become a dentist. Students should engage in a career early because they can find a lot of resources to get there. A second reason students should be in a career early is because they will find something fun to do. Most students dont really do anything after school or in their free time. The students who dont take action in doing anything, will more likely become miserable and bored. For these students the only thing they should do is join in after school program that helps and educates students about careers. Students should be involved in a career at a young age because a lot of students dont know what to do in their free time. Also, students dont really have a hobby they can do. Students sometimes dont really think about having a hobby that can keep them happy. Students can find that hobby by taking part in a career and actually find something that really interests them. Students need to be in a career at a young age because they will find something that is important to them. A final reason students should commit to a career early is because they wont have to worry about it in their adult lives. Most teens dont know what they wanna do later on as they become adults. These people usually struggle in finding a job, and also getting that job. If a student spends extra amount of time in school reading and getting information about a career, they wont have that problem later on. In fact they will easily know what they want to do. Students who get into a career at a young age wont have any problems in finding a job later on. In addition to finding a job, students as they get older wont have any stress on what they want to be. When students graduate high school they are pressured in finding a job, which makes them really stressed. Some students arent as stressed as others because they already know what interests and them and what they wanna be. If a student who doesnt know at all what they wanna be, they should spend lots of time on researching and attending career based programs to give them an idea or two on what to be. Students should part of a career at a young age because they wont be as stressed. Some people firmly believe that students should not commit to a career at an early age because they arent well educated about a career. Unfortunately, these students are more likely to have problems later on when finding a job. In order for students to fully know about a job is to take part in a career fair or just overall being in a career so they can be sucessful when doing so. Students should commit in a career early because they will be more educated in a career. In addition to, they will find a hobby in their free time. Finally they wont have any stress or problems later on in finding a job. ",9,9,9,9,9,9,2451,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"
240,153,5F8195FBA0CA,"Imagine schools use cell phones in classrooms for educational purposes, students will not have a hard time to find information on their classes. Schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom, this rule is important because cell phones are the distraction, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. Certainly, some people think cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can have a cell phones break after finishing their test, they can enjoy some entertainments on the cell phones, some students will focus more on education with the musics on their cell phones. Others believe cell phones should be allowed in classroom because students can easily work on the projects, they can search for more information that they do not know much about. Still others argue cell phones should be allowed in classrooms because they will help some foreign students with the dictionary apps on the cell phones. Cell phones also help students in classrooms such as: reviewing notes by playing kahoot, some games apps which include school knowlegdes. However, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because they are creating an opportuniy for students to cheat on the test or the exam. Students will definitely use the cell phones during the test in classroom if cell phones are allowed. For example, students usually take pictures of the answers and send them to the other students. The second reason of why they cheat is because everything can be easily saved and taken on the little smart cell phones, so why do students have to spend a hard time to study for the test ? They can just easily write down information on their test from the little smart cell phones, so what is the point of education? This rule is definitely unaccepted. Furthermore, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classrooms because the cell phones are the huge distraction. Imagine everybody is sitting quietly in classroom, and suddenly the little noise is popped up from the cell phone, catches a thousand of peoples views. Of course no one likes being distracted but having the cell phones during classes is the huge mistake that causes the bad things to everybody around. For example, some students always play some unappropriate songs very loud while everybody else is taking the test, this situation always happens in every school. The second reason is the person who is with a cell phone, can attract the other one who sits beside, and interrupt other students business. Finally, schools should not allow students to use cell phones in classroom because they will cause the laziness, lack of knowlege, and procrastination to students. Students will keep messing on their cell phones, and ignoring the education, causing the lack of knowledge. Students will not absorb enough knowledge into their brain because they can just easily search for information on their cell phone without thinking critically of what they are doing. They can have the good results but actually they have nothing in their brain from school. The more schools allow students to use cell phones, the more they are worsening their students. Cell phones should not be allowed for students to use in classrooms because cell phones are the huge distraction in classrooms, even in other public places, students will have an opportunity to cheat on the test or the exam using the cell phones, and cell phones will cause the laziness, lack of knowlegde, and procrastination to students. If the cell phones are allowed in every school, students will not need to go for education because everything is available to use on cell phones. Schools only need the real hard working, and the real quality from students, not from websites on cell phones. Every school should always have to think critically about the effects of allowing students to use cell phones in classrooms.",8,7,8,7,7,9,1234,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

They say that example is not the main thing in fluencing others becuase being a example can be stressfull. For example, they can be stressfull on trying to do everything perfect to do not do wrong things to influence others and they have to be responsible with what they do to not do mistakes so that they can influences others and they feel that it is a very stressfull responsability of influcing others. However, they believe that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people and being a good example makes they feel responsible to others and they feel that they have the responsability to do the right way in their own so that they can be a good example to others. In reality, they say that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others people because they feel that they have the responsibility with their own behavior so they can do the right way in their own first to influence others. They also say the having respect to others is a good example of our behaviors and being humildity is also a nice examples that we can teach or influenes to others. They believed that being honest with anyone is also a good example of our behaviors. For example, they believe that being responsible with their own behavior is a good example to start doing the right way and to influence others because the responsability gives to others respect. They say the being on time in any meeting makes they responsible with their own behavior and gives other a good example of responsability. They say that responsability is a example of our own behavior and can be something that they can learn with the time and needs practice. I believe that being honest with others is a good example by start setting our own example behaviors. I also believe that humildity is a good example of our behavior because the humildity and that responsability is something that I can learn from others with their own actions or their behaviors. For example, I learned how to be responsible with my things for my mom and my dad because they teaches me how to do it and that this need practice too and I also they teaches me that being a example with our own behavior makes you humildity and teaches you how to valore what you already has and accept what I dont have. In conclusion, they want to argue that setting a good example by your own behavior is the best way to influence other people because being a good example by your own behavior teaches they how to do the things rights, so they can influence others by doing and taking the right way and also teach how to be responsible, honest, and being respect to others.",6,5,6,6,4,5,3489,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Like if i were on the position of taking online classes, because im working and i dont have that much time i would loved to study when ever i could. For Example: some people that are here in the United States they have to go to school and work after school, and they got to pay rent, send money to their families back in there Contries. For Example: Some of the people dont have someone that can take them to school and the school is far away that the buses can not go all the way to their homes. For Example: There are some kids that dont go to school, having the school next to them, but theres alot of people out here thet would love to go to school or even take online classes but they cant because some of them are always working, some of them even have two jobs. For Example: My mom wouold loved to take online classes at less but she cant because she has to work in the very morning like at 7 am, and she comes back like at one she cleans the house and then like at 3pm she goes to her other job and she gets out like at 11:30 pm so she doesnt have time but she would love if she could do it.

244,239,EBD586EB3AA8,"Schools should not have a four day school because, some students may not have time to stay more hours, some students have a part-time job and others help parents to taking care of younger siblings. However, some people have different points of view by, believing that extending schools days that benefits the energy, resources and even helping students to learnd more. An example, is just having four days work or school week. This adaptation can have good and bad benefits. Some people believe that, havig just four days of school is a bad idea because a student will not have time to work or do other activities. A reason of this is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parents taking care of their siblings. One of a major idea is students will not have time to do their activities. Since school is going to end late. Students need to finish all school assignments. However, Elementary schools will end later that High schools or Middle schools. That will not letf them much longer for them to pass time with their family. Students will be more eshausted, that can be really worrying because their grades can go down. Parents will not be happy with their kids grades. This adaptation can be really helpfult for some people. However, it can affect some other people lifes. Another reason is some students have a part-time job. They will no have time to work and even if, they have the time its going to be difficult for them. An example, if students get out from school late they have to run to their house to get ready to go work because they may be late for work. However, going to work for them is not that easy some of them dont have their license yet. Some of them have to walk even take a public bus. Before considering the benefits of four days of school week there are a lot more disadvantages that can affect students with their normal life. The last reason is teenagers helps parents with their siblings. Although that can change because if students have to stay more at school their schedules will be longer than a normal. An example, parents will have to find someone that can stay with their kids and that means that is going to be more cost. Parents will be unhappy paying more money to a babysitter. However, is reallly hard to find someone that can be dependable. Even if teenegers have the time to take care of their siblings, they will not have time to do their own stuff because they have to do two things at the same time. In conclusion, these ten hours school not just affect students will affect the whole family because students will end really eshausted even, teachers will get tired too. After considering all the benefits and disadvantages there is a point about conserve energy and resources that does not make sense, if students get two more hours of school for four day that means that there is not any conserve anergy or resources because we still using the same five days hours in four days instead five days. Reasons why students should not have four day week is because schools days will be more longer and there is going to be less time for them to do activities, student will not have time to work and help their parent taking care of their siblings.",8,6,8,7,6,7,3438,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

For example, we teenagers have to some activities after school or we have jobs and if its not because of those things its because were stuck in traffic. I do understand the reasoning of why we shouldnt be driving at these hours of the night Its mainly because were exhausted at that point we cant focus that much. To say something we teenagers we can stay awake much more longer than you adults why do you think we stay up for so long its not because were bored no its because we want you to see that we can hold our own wait and we stay up for our jobs and dont sleep until we go home when we get home because in truth we can hold ourselves now. Dear to the city council I actually do think we should have teenagers off the road before 12AM. For example, thats when people that are under the influence are mainly on the road and depending on where you are there could be deer. There are lots of dangerous things in the night that no one can see or even some dangerous people that might harm us in the night.

One, they could get a zero on the test, and a zero on a test will lower the students grade. Second, the student could get sent to the principals office and could get a call home. The students parents will also be upset. They would be in trouble at home and at school. Second, If a student cheats on a proficiency test, it shows the teacher that the student doesnt know the material. For example, at the end of Spanish 1 you have to take a proficiency test. If the person you cheated off of doesnt know then, you fail and have to retake Spanish 1 again. For elementary it could be a spelling test. If they fail the spelling test they could also get a bad grade. Last, the student could loose their teachers trust. The teacher would never let them seat next to a student during a test. Teachers trust is hard to gain back when you loose it. The students teacher will always keep their eye on the student that cheated.

So what i tried to do is do all my work fast at work so like that i can go home and get my homework done. Playing soccer for the school is the most fun activity i have done in my life, because i get to meet new people and compete against better players. Sometimes i have to play against some players that are really good at soccer and i might not have a chance to beat them but that doesnt mean i will stop being positive. I am always telling my self i can do it. I tried to pass my positive attitude to my team mates. When everyone starts being positive we play better games and we beat the good teams that we could not defeat a year ago. I love my work, but sometimes i am to tired and i just want to go home. I do not get leave my job till i finish cooking all the stuff that need to be ready for the next day. Also i got to clean the floor an the kitchen. If i want to leave early i need to be positive, that i will finish every thing fast. Like that i would not have to leave late. The good thing about my work is that i get to work with my best friend, he is always positive like me, so we do our job faster but well done. When i get homework and i have to work the night i just want to cry. But i tell my self that if finish all the work fast. I would get to go home and do my homework. i would not have to go to sleep late, beacuse of my work and homework. Being positive helps me finish everything fast so can go to sleep fast. In conclusion, Being positive is the key of success in life beacause, being positive gives you happinest and makes you do your job with more joy. Many people should change their negative attitude because neggative people never succed in life. When you are a positive person more of your goals are going to be achive. Also just not that you will make other people start being positive.",6,6,6,7,6,6,1370,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
253,1775,BB0157B70CA5,"Homework can be hard most of the time, and you need someone to help you with it. Having an afterschool homework club can be fun and a good thing to do in school. An afterschool homework club can be good for the kids that dont get to finish their homework or dont understand the homework. On the other hand, we have the people that dont have time to do things after school. An after school homework club would not be good for some of the students. People dont always have the time to do something after school. They have other things that they have to do like, practicing for a sport, dance, sing, learning an instrument it could be anything the problem is that they dont have enough time to do homework, even when they get home. An afterschool homework club is good for the kids that dont have nothing to do for the afternoon so they can stay and finish homework from that day or something that they need to finish. I am one of those people who is against the afterschool homework club. Sometimes I need to go to preactice, so I dont have time to finish my homework but, I try my best to finish it and turn in the homework the next day. Teachers might dont have the time to stay after school too, because they have things to do like if they have a pet they have to give it food so it wont starve or have kids and they need to take care of them so nothing bad happens to them. So that is another reason why they should not have afterschool homework club. Most of the students wont have a ride back home because their parents can be working, they can be sick, or they are not home. I dont think the school is gonna take care of all the students that go to the afterschool homework club. That is another reason why afterschool homework club is not good. What if the kids get hungry while begin in the afterschool homework club. I dont think the school is going to have food. If the school is thinking about making a club they could make it at the last class so the students take that block so they can only do homework. It would be better if the school makes the club at the last class of the day so the students take that block for only to finish homework. So the students that dont have time after school wont struggle about not finishing their homework at time because, they have other activities to do after school. It could be good too so everyone can take a little break of the day they had. This could help a lot so, if theachers have things to do like, grade papers or homework to check they can take that block to do all of that. Another good idea could be, that they can make the club at fist block, at the start of the day, like if one of the students never did their homework last night they still have time to finish it in the morning before they go to class. My favorite one was the one in the last class because, everyone gets a little break even the teachers. Everyone gets to finish their homework and no one has worrys about not finishing their homework and have a little bit of more free time in the afternoon.",8,6,7,7,7,6,2516,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

255,324,CDDFBBACC7B6,"I think that people find community parks,state parks enjoyable. Because everyone can go to them, family time and also if your stress you can go there. My first reason why i think that community parks or state parks are the best is because everyone can go to them. You and your friends can go and just have a blast. Theres so much stuff to do like play sports with other people .You can even meet new people that you dont even know. Because not everyone that is there your gonna know because everyone can go. For example the Generic_City park that place is so fun you can play sports with you family and buy stuff like food,clothes and other stuff. my second reason is that you can have family time. Family time is so important to me because your family is always going to be there for you and the park is a great place to spent time with them. You can meet up with your family at the park. And also you can have a small little birthday party and just have fun there with your family. If you have little sibling they are going to love it because theres a park and kids love the park and the adults can be talking like your aunt with your mom. And also i fell like being outside with your family is better because you just get to look at the trees and nature instead of being inside. my last reason is if your stress, i been stress before and i feel like the best places to go are the parks because you just can forget about everything and just draw or write. And if your stress you can do so much things like yoga and after cumming things. The park can also help people in different ways like they can be relaxing .And also if your going throw something i feel like being outside is the best thing because if your inside your only going to get worse. So the park can help in different ways like stress. In conclusion the reasons why the community parks or the state parks are enjoyable or people might find them enjoyable is because everyone can go to them, family time and If your stress. And you can do more fun stuff not just this. I love to go to the community parks because i get to spent time together with my family and we just have a good time.

This can also sat that the person thinks you are loyal and trustworthy and that they can believe in you more then they already did. Yes is may hurt the person feelings,but, you are there to help them get though it and make them feel OK. When being honest with people it can build up trust with you two because they know that you can talk about things without lying. This can also effort how they see you as a person. Even if the truth hurts them they know that you were able to tell them what was happening or if someone was saying something bad about them. This can also build up trust and build up friendship and relationship. People dont like it when you lie to them because it hurts them and makes them feel bad about them self. Honesty can change how people view you as a person. They can even see if you would be loyal to them when they need you the most. They can also see if your a real friend or something more with being honest. This can also give you respect that you want or need.

259,1804,7726A1F9C660,"The violin is a hard instrument to master, even with many years. It takes hours and hours of practices and skill to enjoy putting your time into it. I always had a great amount of interest in violins as a kid. Soon enough, I was given lessons for the violin. Somethings skills you would want to have is patience, knowing to push yourself to a current limit, and enjoying it. With those skills, my talent on the violin has increased over the years and overcame phases. When I first shown interest in violins, as I remember, was in Generic_City back in 2008. We were at a gas station on a road trip, and stopped to eat. I saw a kid magazine with a toy violin that came along with it. That really caught my attention, as I begged my mom to buy me it. Eventually, she gave in and bought me the toy violin. I pretended like it was a real violin, and strung the strings with my fake bow. Ever since I had gotten that toy violin, I would not stop bringing it everywhere with me. After a few years went, I had moved to Generic_City and my parents decided I should actually get lessons on the violin in 2013. On the first lesson, I felt really nervous because my wish was finally coming true. I really thought I was going to be perfect on the first day. Of course, I was not good at all on day one. Soon, came to my realization that the violin is something you could not master in just in a year. My dad had made me a daily schedule for me to practice everything, so I could increase my talent and abilites. Thats how I was able to go through the ""first phase"" of violin lessons went by. Saturday afternoons felt super weird since I was not attending any lessons. My family and I had moved back to Generic_City, and I did not have any violin lessons. During the last two years of the four, in Generic_City I had be slacking off from my practices. Yet, I still wanted to continue with my talent and not give up. After a few months went by in Generic_City, I begged my parents to let me take lessons on violin. It was dejavu all over again from 7 years ago. We found out there was after-school lessons I could take. Suddenly, everything felt like the very first lesson I took in 2013. The new instructor said I was pretty good and could immediately start on the second book, instead of the first ""beginners"" book. It felt great knowing I was off to a great start. Everything was going fine for the next five months, until I started to slack off again but worse. I always enjoyed playing the violin, but it began a chore. I was not improving as much, as I was back in Generic_City. I did not feel happy about the violin for the next three years. The thoughts of how the violin was not going to take me anywhere always lingered in my mind. It was not my dream to be a famous violinist or an instructor. Reasons just kept piling up till I told my parents about my thoughts and feelings. They had told me it would be a waste of six years worth of money for me to give up. I still practiced and slightly improved, but I still unhappy. You can tell if someone is doing something they clearly dont want to do, but are forcing themselves. After countless of arguments, cries, and rants to friend, I realized that no one can convince me to enjoy the violin again instead, I had to convince myself to. Our family was moving once again, but to Virginia. Every since we left Generic_City, I had not touched a violin in a year and that is when I was reminiscing on the days when I was playing the violin. I thought to myself, why did I hate practicing and going to lessons so much? The violin is something that I could never let go of because of the amount of work and years put into it. I would love to improve on my talent more instead of throwing it all out, it would be a big waste to do so. You should always push yourself to a current limit though, not until you breakdown. But you can give a lot of time to decide whether or not you will ever be happy from doing something you dont currently want to do. It could really be just a phase you could be having. The best feeling is honestly really great knowing that you werent pushing yourself to do something you didnt want to do anymore. That is how I grew my skills, and my talent in violin more. I also grew to enjoying the violin more. ",7,8,7,8,6,8,1552,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

The student are not going to have time to be doing bad things with there friends, they are going to focus more in the school and in there future. And that way we as student we are going to have batter future, we can be more batter in what we do. It will help us to be more mature, it will help us to act like adult, because we are doing things of adult. it will help us to appreciate the life.

I have a friend that he would love to have the career that he wants, but he didnt had experience in what he want, because he had never being associate with the career that he wanted, when he took the decision to have the carer that he wanted, it was to latte.

263,186,AB9527C4A312,"Technology have the limitation of human contract is due to use of technology had positive or negative effects on peopless lives. Humans use the technology for some differents things,on this times technology is almost everywhere. If the technology did not exist we cant had more opportunities for learned more things for our life. Also,the people dont need to see face to face for had a conversation, because the technology are very advance that if you only cant had a phone you can communicate for text with people in other continents or countries. technology make all more easy than can be. i think that the technology can be affect in a positive way .For that a have some examples: Technology is used for many things on humans life that make that the technology had a positive effect. For example,for some people the technology is their work they dont need to ask to nobody if they had a question about something ,if they did not had technology they can work and they can had money for live. Also,on the schools teachers and students need to use the technology,most of the time the students do their works on computers and they need to turned in by way of Internet and if they had a question about something they can found on internet,on the schools is very important the technology they use for many things,on the schools of united states students and teachers use to do their works like 50% of technology they use more the technology for found information and they dont use a lot of books .In other way one part of the most people that use the technology is the doctors. They had a lot of technology devices,they use that for help people,the most part are for do operations that help them to safe more life than the pass times they now trust more on the technology that the books. However technology is use a lot on fabrics and that make that the people dont work hard like on fabrics that need to packed the technology is the that make more the work than the people. Humans can use technology to do good or bad things. For example,with the time the people begin to learned little by little on how can they use the technology. The most part of people use the technology to do good things,like for their works like secretaries,teachers,doctors,and another works that use technology to communicate or safe things .Other people use the technology for teach to the children,in the Latin countries some parents begin to call the technology the new babysitter, for the reason that the technology like the phone, tablets , etc and more things like them are one of the ways more easy for distracting the children when their moms need to do or make somethings they use the technology and they dont need to other persons be with your children for distracting .Other people dont had good things on how can they use the technology and they learned how use however they use to defraud or search people on their social media they communicate a lot with the people. Some times they use to sequester people or to rob other peoples bank accounts. In some times is a lot of cases where the old people treated of fraud the children between the technology,like the socials media or online games they use to communicate in a bad way .In this case a lot of people death,in other are to use the technology on a bad way is when people want to be a hacker and they dont care to who they go to steal their accounts, in most of the case they steal banks accounts and use a lot of technology for that . that make me thing that if we had more opportunities to use the technology not all people think on good ways to use. Technology can change the way of people live and think. for example. On one part the technology can do that the people feel safety of how their live in a good way on their house because the technology is more advanced and their create many things for people can be safe. Also, the technology make that the people that like to express on public can had a work in the social medias and show the their like to do like the youtubers they dont know who are washing then but they always talk like their know who see. the technology change the form of think of the old people because their in the pass time they need to write letters but now they can send a text or do a video call they dont need to be face to face . the limitation of the communications it is okay if you don see the person for talk. and if you are with your friends on one online game you need to had communication with him and you can talk face to face because he live in the other part of the world you can talk between the technology that make that the technology had a positive effect on the limitation. Conclusion, some times the limitation of the human contact had a negative effect. For example, when you are in your work you need to have communication with your companion of work because you need to had a good relation with him. Also,if you are in a relationship with someone you cant communicate with him or her only for text you need to talk with your partner for had a good contact each other. However if you see the things for other way like when you are in the schools you need to found a answer and you do trust on that you classmate said you can discuss with other people by technology or search for that. on the conclusion for all my examples i think that no matter what if we had or not had human contact because both had positives an negatives effects. sometimes humans prefer technology more than books for search something because that are Lacy and dont want to read and the technology no always give to us good answers. But in limitation i think we need to had more human communication that technology communication.",5,5,7,4,4,6,2299,"conventions 6, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
264,3326,F7CBE1D11BF8,"Is true self-esteem caused by self-confidence or is it caused by achievement, are people right about what they believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence or is self-esteem caused by achievements? Self-esteem is caused by achievements, although some people may believe self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement. By personal experience my self-esteem is caused by my own achievements. True self-esteem is caused by achievements for example: We can say, an employee at Chipotle has recently been elected ""employee of the month"". People may say "" what does that have to do with self-esteem?"" It does have to do with self-esteem because, that person has recently been elected employee of the month, and is being rewarded for his achievement of being elected employee of the month for his hard work. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by self-confidence. I personally still believe achievement is prior to self-confidence, and its the cause of someones self-esteem like; being elected employee of the month, that is one feeling of satisfaction that person had for being elected employee of the month. Next, it is possible that self-esteem could be caused by self-confidence. For example: there may be students that cant start off their day learning without feeling confident about themselves. They may not want to learn, because they dont feel the positive energy or enough knowledge to be able to cope with how theyre feeling that day; whether they want to learn or they dont want to learn. Also, for example: I have a friend who cant learn if she doesnt feel confident. She starts distracting others around her, she starts interrupting class, because it is hard for her to focus and learn when she doesnt feel confident. Although some people believe in praising a students work to build self-esteem. I still believe in achievement being prior to self-confidence. Because in my opinion the second the student is done being praised; they will immediately go back to not feeling self-confident to start their day learning. Finally, true self-esteem is profit to achievement. There is a vast of people around the world being praised for their achievements. Achievements include; If youre being praised for something good youve done like: getting a job, becoming employee of the month, helping someone by carrying their groceries to their car, if an elderly has tipped over in the street and need help getting up, these are the causes of true self-esteem. For example: Last year 2018 at my old school, Generic_school our cheer team felt true self-esteem to find out they had made it to finals. Making it to cheer-leading finals was a vast achievement for them, because it had been 5 years since our team had won finals. In conclusion, true self-esteem is caused by achievement. By personal experience I can conclude that achievement plays a huge role in having self esteem, because my true self-esteem is caused by my own achievements, and due to others personal experience true self-esteem is caused by their achievement. Although some people may believe that; self-esteem is caused by ""self-confidence"". I personally believe, self-esteem is caused by someones achievement.",7,7,6,6,8,8,3708,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

267,1388,A91E59572DA0,"Technology had been a useful tool for the man to make his life easier. Cellphones, smart watches, and more make information very accesible and easy to find. But technology also has a negative impact on social relations, as it reduces human contact and promotes lazyness. The main target is the youth, which is more exposed to technologycal advanced nowadays. When we think about technology, social media comes related too. For some, especially teenagers, these websites work as entertaining platforms, useful to share memories and talk with friends and new people. While these can make contact easier, the risks become higher when social media is not used properly. Posting personal information, such as your adress, cellphone, or location, is an irresponsible action which could lead to unsafe situations. Websites like Facebook and Instagram make identity theft easier: as they reduce human contact, people can take advantage of the users by introducing themselves first as a new friend, to then execute their real intentions. For instance, kidnap and monetary robbery are the most popular cases that come out of social media. In addition, social wesites and items like phones can be utilized in the way. There have been lately a lot of users claiming that their phones are listening at all moment, a tactic which could be useful to spy on people. As this theory has not been confirmed yet, it could be easily enforced by anyone with the required knowledge. Productivity is another factor influenced by technology. The main purpose of most technological items is to make our lives easier and, in some cases like hardwork larbor, it can be very efficient. But when people start spending hours with these objects, the development of dependency towards technology could increase. Video games, for instance, have become the addiction of many kids, who stop performing their typical responsibilities in order to play with these. This is another way human contact is reduced, which will have a significant impact in their future lives. To develop social skills at a young age is very important for kids to succeed in the future. Its true that many factors affect the achievement of succeess and it can not be predicted by the skills a person has; but what its true is that we are always going to be exposed to social interactions and its neccessary to learn how to manage them. A solution for this problem could be in the parents hands. Enforcing limitations on the use of technology not only will create a stronger relationship between them and the children but it will be beneficial for the kids future. After all, technology has become a advantage for many of us in our daily life. However, its important to stay aware about its risks and exercise a responsible behavior when using it. Moreover, we shouldnt let it take total control of our actions and enjoy in-person relations more.

268,3698,1202062A4FA5,"Just like some businesses schools should adopted a four day school week with each day consisting of ten hours by making the school day two hours longer. To conserve energy and resources some businesses have adapted a four day work week with each day consisting of ten hours. Should this school follow this model by extending the school day two hours? After considering the benefits and disadvantages to a four day school week. Some believe that changing the school week to only four days is a bad idea because less school days means most work is not done and students will have extra time they dont need. Other people think a four day school week is an effective way of conserving students energy while keeping the same passe. People are still arguing about this issue. Schools should adopted a four day work week because students will be productive, It is healthy especially for students that work and have time for family and friends. Four days of school week help students to be productive. To be productive you need two things energy and motivation. Most students have the motivation to work but they lake the energy therefor they need four day school week. By extending the school day two hours we can achieve the same amount of work by working only four days. For example one school day is consists of for classes and one class is one hour and forty five minuet long. When we extend the school day two hours long for four days it covers the same time. That helps us to use own time efficiently and increase productivity in the school. Learning four days week also help students to be healthy specially for those who work on the regular days or weekends. People need enough amount of energy to get through the day without fatigue. The only natural and healthy way of get ride of fatigue is sleep. Many scientific studies says ""Kids and Teenagers need at list 9 hours of sleep!"" having four day of school day a week gives students one extra day of rest. It makes a big different and very important for students health. The final reason we need a four day school week day is to give students time with there parents and friends. parents and students want to spent quality time together but they are not able to because some parents work on the weekends or the students work on weekends. Four days school week is the best solution to this problem. It gives students the attention that they need form there parents and spend some time with there friends. If we can change the old school system by this new and effective four day school week days It will be beneficial in many ways not just for students but for teachers and parents.

269,1363,FC2050EA9039,"The world is full of new things that can help make you an outstanding person. Trying something new will help you grow physically and mentally. Even if you dont believe you can do it, you can always try and see. I will prove that trying new things above your skill can make any person grow. Attempting something above what you already mastered can make you the best at whatever you love to do . If I was playing soccer for example, there are many positions to try. If I am already a great striker, why not try playing a defender position that I have never thought to do. This will make me a valuable asset to my team and i will grow with new skills. You can even grow academically by trying new things. It cant hurt to try something hard once in a while. When I am learning math, it doesnt make sense to try and understand a concept that wont make a difference to me, but it prepares me for harder problems in the future. If I do a difficult problem that I cant grasp, it is said that it only helps my problem-solving skills. There is no reason why its not possible to master difficult problems. Other would say that some people have limits to their abilities. They argue that a person who is stuck can not grow. They are wrong because its not so much a person cant grow but dont have the support or energy to want to be able to achieve higher. Sometimes they have have issues with their self-esteem. I believe that every person can grow to a certain extent. In conclusion, I agree with Author Ralph Waldo Emerson on his statement. A person that does not try new things above their own abilities will never grow. Based on my experiences, I understood that trying something I never mastered will only make me grow as a person.

Thirdly they can grow by teaching other people how to learn the same material . You can grow be doing a lot of different activities and teaching methods First way to grow is to try to learn more by studying. This is an important factor to learn more about in full detail like Isaac newton he discovers the law of gravity because of an apple that fell on top of his head. Then he makes a lot of theories about what may cause such phenomenon, so he studied it by creating equations and and a math subject called Calculus. Their are many others for example: Shakespeare, Beethoven, Albert Einstein, Stephen Hawkins, and Leonardo DaVince. These smart men did not stop because their is always something new to discover and grow. Second way to grow is discovering new information. Every single day people learn something new, which is a benefit our society weather its good or bad because you can have new ideas or discoveries. An example is cancer. A deathly decease that can kill you and there is no cure. Scientist are doing experiment on trying to find a cure and that takes a lot of time to gather information. These scientist do not stop even though they mastered science. They want to continue helping people from suffering this bad decease they want to grow and learn more they will not stop until they find a cure, so people can live as long as possible with their families. Third way to grow is by teaching other people. Teaching other people can help you be a better person and letting people know your methods, so they can succeed with your help. Doing that will help yourself and other. Its another way to a good mentality, also you can grow bigger. In conclusion there are different ways to grow even though you mastered it.

275,1243,FF9469424ED0,"All schools have different educational activities, including playing an instrument. There are so many things you can do when you play an instrument. Everyone has seen marching bands doing all types of exciting things in the middle of a football game. Have you not seen the routines they make, those take hard work! Orchestras play classical music and make their sound flow in the room. Not only do they play classical music, but they also play loud and exciting music. Everything you can do while playing an instrument is enjoyable. Some things are more enjoyable than others like being able to listen to yourself making good music, going on fun field trips, and being able to find all different types of music. While playing an instrument you play all different types of music, and all of the pieces of music are good. When you hear yourself play a song well you get a boost of confidence. Hearing your class play well makes you confident that your concert will sound great. It feels good to know that youre capable of playing music that others who arent able to do. You get to enjoy the amazing sound your class makes. Whenever you play an instrument you normally audition for the class you want to get into and when you get into it, you are full of joy. Its always nice to know that you can achieve the level that you want to achieve. The opportunities you get while playing an instrument are endless. When being in band or orchestra you get the opportunity to go on field trips. Schools dont normally go on field trips unless the students are in band or orchestra. They offer the field trips to people who play an instrument because of all their hard work they put into it. All the field trips you go on are enjoyable because of the people in your class. You always make friends whenever you join band or orchestra. Some schools know that the students want more fun, so they include more field trips than others. Every field trip is a gift to the students who play their instruments from the school. Some places that schools go to are Kings Dominion, Busch Gardens, Hershey Park, and many more exciting places. Those all have roller coasters, water activities, and carnival games, who wouldnt want to go there. Every movie or show has a soundtrack which the classes can play. You can always search up the sheet music to any song you want to play. You can also make your own sheet music and play that yourself. You can play every song on an instrument. People enjoy playing the music theyve wanted to play since they first started playing an instrument. There are movies that people love and the people who can play an instrument are able to play that movies theme song. Not a single song cannot be put in sheet music so, if anyone ever wanted to play their favorite song they could search it up and it would pop up. Even though some songs are harder to make sheet music for theyre still possible to do. When playing an instrument, practice does make perfect. Nothing about playing an instrument is easy, but everything about it is fun. The effort put into playing your instrument does pay off at the end. Playing well can make you so happy and proud of yourself. Not only are you proud of yourself, but others are proud of you. Being able to play an instrument is a privilege that not everybody gets. There is nothing that can stop someone from becoming a part of the music community. The friends you can make and go with to the exciting field trips. Play all the music youve ever wanted to play. Everything you can do in band is limitless. ",7,7,9,7,8,8,3900,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Unfortunately, I cant play the final game because the game before I commited a foul and I get a red card. my team loss the game, it was too lake for me do anything about it. I realized that not matter what I did in the past; it always be a new oportunitie for improve and teach myself that failure its has an important role in life to be success. Futhermore, another important reason is that it gives people a better chance to corret it. This reminds me to a friend, who was in a situation where he was really disappoint because he fail his driving test. The next day, he cames to my house and talk to me about it. I remember that I told him to keep in his mind that its important to be prepare for any situation that you know you have a lot of chances to pass if you triying and triying you will get on it. A lack of success depending in achieving goals and dreams. I think that failure is also a way to teach people that even if you fail you just always have to try no matter how many times you try it as long as you trying without lossing the enthusiasm you will reach your dreams, or goals. Some people would argue that success is not consist in failure; however, everyone in our society knows that failure is an important part in life to be success. People learn from failure and it gives people a better chance to corret it. There is not limits to reach ours dreams as long as you keep going to complete it. Provides everyone a learning that not martter how harder is life, there would be millions of chances to be success with anything you want to do. In conclusion, success consist in failure without lossing enthusiasm. The statement of ministre Winston gives people a reflection about a topic of how failure is important for success.",6,5,6,4,5,6,543,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Because a lot of people dont came to school because they need money to buy food and pay his rent because they dont take help from his family. For my example i came to school because my family help me but a lot of people from others country came to this country and they dont have family here so they wanna study but they wanna help his family and his county and if a lot of school have the program what you can take class from you home i think is more better because you can do a lot of thinks for example i know a lot of people they wanna study but they need to work so they say they cant study and work in the same time so they have to take one of two option so they have to pick one and they say they wanna work because if they go to school they cant make money and if they work they can buy his food and they can pay the rent for example i have one cousin he was in school and he need just one year to graduate but when he was in schhol his mom said he need to work because she dont wanna pay his rent anymore and he leave the school and he dedicated just to work because he need pay his rent and if school have the program he can work and he can study too that one is to sad because he ned just one more year to graduated and he dont graduated because he need pay his rent thas want i think is a lot of school have the program they help a lot of guys Here is one more example a lot of people live in mountains and the bus dont go so they dont have transportaion so they dont come to school that is sad because maybe they wanna study and they cant come. i know people in west virginia. they don. t go school because the school is like 1 hours and they dont have transportation. and if all the school in united state have the program they can help a lot of familys and they cxan open a lot of doors for the people. Here is another example i have one friend. He come to school just one or two days per week. Because he need to work. Because he said he have to work because he dont have money for buy food and pay rent in the same time that is sad because he said i want to graduated but i cant because i havde to work for pay my rent and buy my thinks. and if schools have the program they can help him to do his gol. I meet one friend in walmart last week i play for soccer team in Generic_City . and i was with my short that say barsity in the from of the short. and the guy said hey in think i know you and i said where you saw me. and he said in Generic_City and. He ask me if im in Generic_City now and i said yes and you and said im not in school anymore. and i said why and he said because inmigration took my parents and they send to my country and im alone in this country so i need to work for pay a lot of think. and he said i wanna study but i cant because i cant do two thinks in the same time. and said my gol is work with police and i said hey wanna you dont study in the day and work in the night and he said i cant because i have to help my parents in honduras because id i dont send money to then they can buy food. my mom maybe love if i take class onlines because she work all day. if i take class online and can help her to do thinks in my home because she go to work in the morning at 7 am and she came back at 5 pm and the end she go to the part time and she come back at 11:45 pm and if i take class online i can wok too and i can help her with think in the home and money to pay a rent she is to old.

281,1618,F45967CEFA55,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill stated a quote that said, ""success consists of going from failure to failure with out loss."" There are 3 reasons why I agree with this statement. The first reason is, failing will want to make you push for a success, the second reason being that youll have more of enthusiasm when youre find more ways to succesed, and the third reason is achiving for higher goals. I agree strongly with this prompt and Winston Chruchills quote, yet some people think its something at may not be true and think less of them self. In the first paragraph I will explain my first reasoning with a strong example of it. First, reasoning to this prompt would be, falling will want to make you push for success. Even though not many people think that is the way that many of our past inventors had learned. Albert Enstine was one of the smartest people out there, yet he had come face to face with failure many times in his life. The only way he learned was to try many other different ways to solve his problems. He used failure as an insperation to to keep trying like our first inventor of the light blub. Even though many people found it frusterated and diffivult when theyve failed, which pushes on to my second reasoning. Next, the reason would be that many people think different about them selfs when they fail in something. Thomas Edison thought different, even though he had failed 100 times, he had not gave up. When he finally successed, he said a quote that is in my mind till today in this presnet day. That quote was ""I didnt fail 100 times, I found 100 ways that it didnt work."" Even though, Thomas Edison had failed he maintaned him self with a lot of enthusiasm, Failure is never an option, but finding a solution to it is a success. Finally, the last and final reason is achiving for high goals that you want to reach. It dont matter what others may think of it or if youll be able to achive or not. Show them that they are wrong even if you come to a failure dont stop, find a solution and fix it to make it better than before. Youll reach higher goals with higher potential then what youll ever imagine. Then later on you will be able to do anything you put your mind to and demonstrate your knowlage to the world. In conclusion, doubting yourself is not how you achive your success. Finding a way to solve it is achive your success. Get the insperation from the people who had once been in your spot and they done to successed to there goal. Even if failure is a role in life to find success its the only way youll reach it. Failure is only a motivation to get you to successed.",8,6,8,7,6,6,3623,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
282,525,ECF265A73C7E,"According to the Washington Post, there has been an increase in student population in schools around the U.S. they are being crowed with more and more students every year. Because of this more students in the future will need to take online classes at home instead of going to the school and doing so. Being able to do class work at home, will benefit the students that live far from the school; they attend and make it easier for them to get the education they still need. Distance learning will also help the students manage there time better. Because of the fact the students dont have to go and spend time at the actual school. The travel time it takes the students to go and come back from school would not be a factor anymore if they attend online classes in there house. A reason distance learning could benefit students is that it could improve student attendance. If you were sick and could not go to school you can work on the things you will miss at school. Another thing is that for the students that struggle with transportation to get to school on certain days; instead they can finish the school work at home which would be easier instead of stressing over how they are going to get to school. The way it would benefit students is that it will help them focus more on work than instead of focusing on transportation to school. This could also benefit on the days that school gets canceled. For example school gets canceled because of a snow day or some other reason. Something that is really big on news right now is the outbreak of the Coronavirus. The U.S. is deciding to close schools in certain states around the country. Distance learning could benefit by if some schools were to actually close, it would not affect student education as much as it would if there was not a way to learn at home. If there was a snow day and some parents did not want there kids to walk to school on the sidewalk because it was dangerous; and they could drive them either because of the fact they had to go to work. A easier and safer way would be just to have them do the school tasks in there house. In the past when it rained or snowed really hard and the next day I had to go to school sometimes the roads would be flooded or their would have been an acident that prevent me from getting to school. In those cases it would be nice to have the option to learn from home instead of going through the trouble to figure out a way on how to get to school. In some cases it is better for the students to work at school than it is at home. A reason being is at school they can meet new friends and be in a better working and studying envoirment. Another thing would be that their are less things that could distract you from completing work. For example when you are at home you have all your computers, phone, TV, and things like a Xbox that could get you distracted or off topic. When you are at school their are friends that can distract you to but when you are in class it is hard to do anything else besides work. The reason is that your teacher wont let you go on your phone or talk to your friends as much before you finish with your in class assignment. A Benefit from going to school is that a lot of the things that you learn come from talking or hearing it from people at school. So if you attend classes at home instead of going to school it impacts some things that you could actually learn from going to school. A lot of the things I have learned in my past is from talking or asking a friend how to complete an assignment, if you are at home and have nobody to talk to it is not as beneficial as it is going to school. The fact being that their are benefits from learning at home and learning at school. Because when you are at home you can get distracted easier cause their is no teacher that is watching over you to complete your assignments. But when you are at school you are surrounded by other kids that could talk to you and disturb you on doing your work. Their are pros and cons in both situations but having the option to attend classes at home is better than not having the ability to. Because of that I think that distance learning is better in most cases cause it gives you more options in how you can complete work.",7,7,7,8,8,8,3463,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

286,2144,A4A90A401002,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. This is reasonable for each individual, and people should make their own decisions in life. We always ran into problems and sometimes we need to make decisions on our own. When we have the choice and decide to make the differences, its important to follow our instincts and we have to take the responsibility to make the good choice. This is how we learn by ourselves. In our daily life, people always ran into problems and get stressed out, for example, the car broke down in the middle of the traffic, failing the test that youve been studying for weeks, your boss fired me today... However, it is our choice to make the right decision and to change it; you could call for help from someone, you can study harder or ask others to help on the school work, and also look into other jobs that you are interested in. There are so many options for everyone to pick and to follow our own instincts and ideas to make everything better. As an adult, soon after high school I will be joining navy and have my own life, to do everything by myself. Everything around me will change completely,I will not have my parents standing beside me to teach me common sense, nor my teachers to teach me about life lessons, nor any of my friends to be there and help me out, this is all about me and my decision to make. If Im going to learn the hard way, I will have to learn the hard way. Maybe my instincts kick in and help me out, you never know. Making your own judgment is one of the most important survival skills we will have to learn in life, everyone will grow up one day, to have your own family and all the responsibilities, now you are the one who have to decide everything, to have responsibility for not only yourself but you family as well. Instincts will tell you which way your heart goes, and sometimes it might leads you to the wrong path, but dont worry, this is how we are going to learn. Success is not an easy path, its full of adventure and false on the way to finish. You will experience more fail than you can ever imagine before you achieve the goal, to success it all by yourself is to follow your instincts and ideas. You may have concerns that what if you seek guidance for experts and authorities about lifes important matters? Guess what, life is full of adventure, you never going to know what is coming next and not everyones life is going to be the same, so therefore seek guidance for experts may work for some people, not all, you may have found a different solution for yourself. All we can do is listen what others advises are, Because you will be the one who make the final decision, and you are responsible to your decision, not anybodys advice or common. Everything is on you and to follow your heart to make things right, or to learn how to judge then choose the right path. No one will change your life unless you let it happen, no one can change your final decision unless you dont follow your instincts and heart.

287,2313,63C74FF7DB27,Take learning distance on home is not good ideas . first reason is not the same to take on school. when we going schools we have more option to learning. sometime when we dont undertant something we can ask the teacher for helping or they can explain many times. But sometimes we have to take the classes on home. for example if you are sick or have a spcific reason that you can going schools is necesary take online because if we whant to learn is the matter we we have to take the classes. the important thing is that we have the energy to continues with your goals. The Learnig distance on home some time be helping to be more possitive and focud because we can take the clases any hours we can. Also when we cut the clases on home we have more chance to listining. The other option to take the clases on home is that we can do other things that we whant. Some schools give the chance to often the clasas on home that is great ideas. but sometimes is really important to going schools beacuse when we going schools we have more chance to take more clases and graduated with the other student. Also take clases for video conferencing or going school is little similar becuaser we can see the teacher that is explain the clases. That uniquet things is we can not ask the teacher for helping. In conclusion. To be attend on schools is more important and helping more tham the distance learning or video conferencing. On my posisition attend on schools is more necesary because we have more opportunity to learm and continues to do the things that we whant. ,4,4,4,4,4,5,1302,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 4, syntax 4, cohesion 4"

Some people think that companies shouldnt look for specific characteristic in people and let the person thats applying, get the job and learn while he/she is working with the company. Some people have a better education than others, which that would be one of the characteristics that company would be looking for, trying to hire someone. But sometimes those people arent good working with other people and in my opinion that is very important to keep and good work environment. I think Im a very good candidate because, Im good working with people, I am always willing to work extra hours if you need me to, and finally Im may not have much experience on this kind of work but Im a pretty hard worker and will try my absolute best to learn the job. One reason, I think I should be hired is that Im good working with people. One of the things I enjoy the most about working is the ability to work and share ideas with people in my past jobs, I feel like it makes the work environment a lot better because it make the work easier and more enjoyable. Because the more are working together the job gets done faster, Im always willing to help if anybody needs me Ill be there planning things out with the person give him/her feed back on what she thinks and work out something that can work for both the company and themselves. I try get along with all my work partners so I can make it the best experience for me and for everyone else around me. Another reason, is Im always willing to work extra hours if needed. I worked extra hours in past jobs before because for one my work co workers because they were sick. So if you ever need me to work for extra hours dont hesitate to give me a call. Because we all need a break sometimes, but there are times where we cant give the workers that break because the company doesnt have enough people to cover that person. Thats why Im willing to work longer hours so those workers can take that break they so much desire. Finally, Im a hard worker like you read in the last paragraph Im willing to work longer hours, so that should give you an idea. What ever job you give me Ill do it at the best of my ability, it doesnt matter what it is Ill do it. Although I dont know how to do much of what this type of does, Ill do my best to learn it as fast as possible so I can give you the best results I can give. Im always willing to do something new and challenging so I can extend the things I know, All I want you to know is that what ever you tell to do I will give my one hundred percent. As you have read this why I think I make a good candidate and a good addition to your team. Im good working with people, Im willing work longer hours if needed, and Im a hard worker. I hope you consider hiring me and i hope the best for the company. I think only when you see me actually working in your company and see the things Im able to bring to the table you will see I was the best option for the job.

Like other schools dont have only 3 extracurricular activities there are other extracurricular activities to think of like I said theirs art, music, cooking, chess club, drama, computer, science, math, reading, writing, anything else not only sports making year books or student council if they repeat all 3 extracurricular activites that dumb boring and Maybe some students may agree with these decisions some student will not argee because not all students share the same personality or have something in common and some students like sports some dont some students dont like making year books some students dont like student counciling. In my personal opinion art is a activity I want. There are many extracurricular activites I want to do I would do art reading and drama because I love to draw I love to read marvel comics especially Dr. Strange Spider-man Guardians of the galaxy and black panther I love drama because I am going to be a actor, and a director when I grow up and I know a lot of students dont only want to do sports malking year book or student council students love other things. I know a lot of students and people opinion. If you must participate in one of these extracurricular activities well everybody will think schools boring but the thing is its the principal decision and chose if he or she want all the students to participate in at least all 3 extracurricular activity then you really have no chose but anyone can still disagree on all extracurricular activities maybe you can ask the principal if you dont want to do any of the activities.",6,5,7,5,6,5,1364,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

293,3835,E069D2A8AE1E,"Have you had a friend sharing wisdom and experiences with you? You probably had that a million times. Here is the thing though. People just want to learn the experience of you and the others, which isnt a bad thing. Its also important to learn each others experiences. I think it is important to learn from other peoples experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if theyre in a situation, and you can communicate each other. To clarify this, lets dig in deeper. First, I think its important that you understand who they are because you get to know about their favorite hobbies, the places they like to visit, the pets they have and their dream vacation. Getting to know on who the person is can give you a good start off to make a bond, or form friendship between you and that person. If you shared your experiences with a person, they might feel interested on what youre talking about. Telling a person on what you like can bring that persons attention deeper. Second, its important that you help the person if theyre in a situation because you can cheer them up if they lost a family member. Helping someone out can make that person feel better and most of all, feel comfortable, and they will think that youre a good person. If you didnt reach out and help somebody, they could start getting into a tougher situation where they might not be able to handle by themselves. They could also feel very lonely or left out, and that is not okay. Third, communicating with others is important because you can text them in Social Media, such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Facebook. You can also go shopping with them. Communicating others bring closer friendship, and keep the bond strong between you and youre friend. Watching movies and hanging out at each others house are another examples of communication. Theyre lots of ways to communicate with your friends and other people, and that is a good thing for friends. Activities is another thing for communicating with other people because sometimes, when people do activities, it provides teamwork. In Conclusion, I think it is important to learn from other peoples experiences because you get to understand who they are, you can help the person if theyre in a situation, and you can communicate each other. So now that you understand, think about these as you make new friends. Question yourself on how to get a good start to form a bond between you and that person. Try to reach out and help him/her if they need help with something. Make that person feel comfortable by hanging out with them at lunch or at home. They might need good company from you!

294,3765,101576652D3B,"The British naturalists and politician John Lubbock wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it. I agree with this statement because people should know how to make decisions themselves instead of relying on others to do it for us. Although we are surrounded by people who influence us ever since we where young, people should choose their own character because people should make decisions by themselves more often. Everyone isnt the same, and we shouldnt always be taught to follow what we see everyone do. Its important that we make choices by ourselves because by doing so, it makes us stronger humans beings who can rely on ourselves and helps us gain self confidence and makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do. Even though Influences help you know whats right from whats wrong, people should choose the person they want to because the people you know might be setting bad examples and you wouldnt even know that theyre wrong because they told you its right. For example, growing up, your guardians could be anyone. They could be good people, or they could be not so good people. Its our job to use common sense and decide for ourselves whats right and whats wrong. Its always good to use your brain and decide if something is morally right or wrong. If you see someone close to you being a bad influence, then one must learn to not replicate those actions, but instead make good decisions their selves. Some might say that influences help if youre lost or confused in life, however, another reason why people should create their own character is because attempting something on your own and not succeeding helps you grow as a person. For example, if you just follow what everyone else is doing, you wont learn because thats the equivalent of you being spoon fed. If you dont attempt anything of your own, you wont know how to do anything by yourself. By always letting people make decisions for you, you wont be able to complete tasks on your own and makes you a less independent person. This is why making your own decisions is important. Not only does it help you grow as a person, but it also strengthens your mind. In life, people often rely on others to build the person they are but in reality, its better to rely on yourself instead of others to make decisions because it makes us rely on ourselves more often then we do, helps us avoid bad influences, helps you grow as a person, and strengthens our minds. All of these things are why we should all grow up by making our own choices and decisions instead of mindlessly do what everyone else does. People have all the power in their selves to be who they want to be. Youre no one other than yourself after all, and thats the most important thing to think about when choosing our own character traits.",9,8,10,9,8,9,215,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
295,1809,2580A540719C,"Yes,I agree with the statement a positive attitude can always lead anyone to success.Positive attitude is the key to success dont lose hope even if you have lost everything. If you have a positive attitude and you work hard today or tomorrow you will become successful. If you have a positive attitude in a hard situation,you will feel like the situation is not hard and you will get over that situation. Positive attitude even helps you to maintain good heath and this will help you to get success. But if you have a negative attitude in a situation you might not get success in life. A positive attitude can will not only change your life but it can also help people close to you in achieving their goal because it will encourage them to become successful. 6 We can even take example of some successful people in the world like Steve Jobs who was forced to leave his own company but he always had a positive attitude,it doesnt matter what the situation was and 3 years later he bought his company back,not only that he had a heart disease and he was supposed to die but his will power and positiveness saved him. We can also take example of famous soccer player Christiano Ronaldo who was discriminated because of his color faced all of his hardships with a smile on his face he stayed positive in his whole life and now he is one of the greatest soccer player in the history. He just thought positve things in his life and overcame most of his hardships. In the modern world, if we even lose a small game we lose hope of winning again,but we have to change this thats not life works, everyone have hardships in their life but a smile on your face can make those hardships easy. Just think how to overcome that situation,instead of losing hope and stay positive. In the end,I would just say that everyone face hardships from a 1 year old kid to a old man but a staying positive can change the whole situation because you will be able to overcome anything. So always stay calm,take deep breadth and stay keep a positive attitude instead of getting negative.",6,6,7,8,7,6,498,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
296,342,5A9C20C851FD,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I extremely disagree with those schools that are offering distance learning for students because students wouldnt be benefit from attended classes from home the students just will be worth probably, they would like to take online classes but then they wouldnt attend they might be sleep, and they wouldnt care about the online classes. The several schools that are offering online or video conferencing classes to students, those schools are doing that in the worse way, because those schools that are offering online classes just would make the students more lazy to attend to school and to receive classes with the teachers at schools, but I believe that students better attend to school than to receive online classes because attending to school the students get an opportunity to know others students and make new friends, and being at home receiving the online classes students dont get the opportunity to know, and meet new people from the same age as them so thats why I believe that those schools that are offering the distance learning to students to receive online classes are doing in a bad path. Although some say that students should attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is much better, because students dont has to attend to school and receive the classes with teachers, actually students shouldnt attend to classes from home by way of online or video conferencing, because students wouldnt learn the much as they learn at schools with teachers, and some students doesnt have internet or electronic devices at home to attend for online classes. Some say that students should attend to online classes or video conferencing. One reason, school offer that option because they dont want to student waste time to attend to school and they believe that students would be benefit receiving classes from their home. However, students can have more time to sleep for those who work until midnight can be a benefit receiving those online classes, but to those students that doesnt work it would not be a benefit even though it will be worth because they just will waste their time on the phone all day and even in the night too because they wouldnt have to wake up early and get ready to attend to school. I extremely believe the opposite, students shouldnt attend to online classes or video conferencing because students will just waste their time at home and not taking the classes on their computers or others electronic devices. Otherwise, Some others students doesnt have the same benefits as the others have for example: some students doesnt have the sufficient money or the same opportunity as the others to buy an electronic device such as computer to receive the online classes, so those students has to attend to school and receive classes with the school personal, thats one reason why I extremely disagree with some schools option like the learning distance. Another reason, attending to school students learn more faster than being at home with a computer because when they are receiving the classes on the computer they will check their social media at the same time as they are taking classes. However, attending to school students can learn many new words from the school personal and leaning new words can be such a great benefit. In conclusion, however some say that attend to the distance learning is better, but I extremely believe the opposite students shouldnt attend to the distance learning, because that wouldnt be a good benefit in their education, and in their knowledge students that take the distance learning they wouldnt learn the same way or the much as they learn when they attend to school and the teachers teach. I disagree with the distance learning that some schools offer to students because the distance learning it wouldnt be a benefit for students who attend to the option distance learning it would be just worth it because they would not learn that much and probably they will not pay attention to what on the classes are teaching to them.

299,906,6D104CA14B33,"75% of the time students graduate early to go to college. Matter of fact I believe that students should graduate in three years and work, because they would save money for college, they will be mature for college, and they would have time management skills. This will help students gain lots of opportunities before college. First, students would have the opportunity to save money for college. Some students like to get a loan for college, because they dont have enough money, and parents cant support him/her. But if students get a loan for college, then they would have to pay it back after college. If students get out of school in three years, then they have the chance to work and save money for college. Students wont need a loan if they work, and the parents would not have to worry about the money. This is good, because students would have to rely on themselves, and have responsibilities. This will show others that you matured, and will make your parents proud. Secondly, students who work will be more mature, because they would have to rely on themselves, have lots of responsibilities, and they would understand the outside world better. Some students who graduate early tend to be 17 years old. If they do the one year work force, then they would gain money and become more mature. Maturity matters, because students need to understand how to turn in work to their professor on time. Being mature will make you an adult, and make others take you serious, not a joke. Some students get bullied, because they are younger than everyone else, and we do want that happening to anyone. But if you do work that one year you graduate early, then you will get into college the same year your friends are, and you wont have to worry about being alone. Lastly, Some students dont turn in school work on time. Work could gain the student time-management skills, because they would have to be at work on time, do what they have asked to do on time, and never be late. Time management skills will help you in school by, turning things on time, not being late to class, and sleeping early for the class you have the other day. Time management skills isnt only for being late and turning work in on time, time management is also important for setting a time to sleep and to wake up. It also helps you by having a time for each thing you do, like studying, working, playing, relaxing, and sleeping. If you have all of that set, then you dont have to worry about being late or not turning anything on time, because they would already have the time management skills and you would be used to it already. I believe that others might disagree with me and say that students should go to college right away, but with all do respect I believe that students would gain a lot of opportunities if they work before going to college, because if you go to college and you arent mature enough, then you will struggle. In conclusion, I believe that students who work before going to college, will gain a lot in life and they will be ready for college. Because they wouldnt have to worry about paying the loan off after college, they would have a better time management skills than others will, and they will become more mature by being responsible and handling it themselves.

305,91,E6CF2D3B4FA2,"Examples are what makes a readers/audiences be able to get attracted with what the reason the writer is talking about. Since I have used examples in many things things in my life, I personally think that they could help you with a topic that other people are trying to talking about. And since the question is basically asking if ""examples are good to influences people that are trying to do something or does examples are useless and are not really helpful at all?"" I said that Examples are good to influence other people. And here are the reasons why it is a good influential if you are striving for a long- term goal. Not many reasons are able to support what you are trying to basically explain or prove. What made me think of this is because if you put a reason that isnt strong enough to even support what you are saying, then basically a reason isnt strong enough if you are trying to influence someone. Like for example, if the topic says that anyone can become famous and the reason is ""work hard and never give up."" that really isnt strong enough to influences someone that actually wants to become that type of guy. But if you put a real life example like ""this person name Generic_Name that was a low-class, lives in a 1 bedroom apartment, and makes not a lot of money. And he heard that he can become a rich person. So he was working hard and he saved up on investment. And somehow he actually became the person that he wanted to be."" that is a example that could be used if you are trying to persuade someone. Examples can be kept as like a precious thing for people. Why this is also important is because if you actually lets say achieve something that you wanted to accomplish for such a long time. You can always remember that thing that made you kept pushing forward, and to never let down what you wanted to do for such a long time. Like for example, a person named Generic_Name made his dream become a reality; which it was to become a architect that works under a famous person. And when he had to make a speech, he remembered a women who was going through exactly the same thing he was going through. And he said that her life will be something he is going to cherish forever because her background is what made him become who he is now. Which everyone can look at for being influenced by this person right here. Examples can actually change many peoples lives because of what they say or just their background. What made me choose this reason? well it was because for the past 16 years of my life, I have always seen many people change their lifestyle because of what people are saying to change them. Like for example, when I was in 8th grade, I had a science teacher that was really nice to everyone and respected them as if we were like his child. And all of the students asked him ""why did you decide to become a science teacher?"" And his response was ""I became a science teacher because I like teaching about sciences and the life of our society. And because of a man that i was inspired by. And everyone knows who this guy is? His name is Bill Nye The Science Guy. The reason why i choose him was because during my time when i was in collage , he was the only person that i knew that actually did science. And I wanted to watch his show. And I was amazed by all the chemicals, types of rocks, everything that has to do with science. And since that happened, i have enjoyed being a science teacher for 10 years."" And this speech shows that people will not be able to reach their goal unless you have a motivational quote, speech, or background of a famous person. While i do think that Examples are good to influence other people that are trying to reach their goal, I still kind of personally think that there are examples that dont really help/influence people. Why I think of that is because people dont find examples of influential that arent interesting or appealing to them at all because its doesnt suit them. Like for example, there was a kid who wanted a game that could make him play it all the time. And he saw a commericial about a game that is coming out next week, and he was getting suprised at first, but when he saw a interview about the game, he wasnt really amazed anymore because what the game director talked about wasnt influencing other poeple at all. So there are some examples that really cant influences them. But most of the time, there are so many examples that are out there in the world that actually changed peoples lives, and their mind about something.

307,3856,ABF21C9A2160,"Are we the future.? Ralph Waldo Enderson said."" To be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make you something else is the greatest accomplishement."" I agree with the statement of Enderson. May be some people will disagree with me. So I think is hard to be yourself in a world that is constantly changing because technology and social norms. First the new inventes and advances in technology has brote new changes to our lives. We live in a world that is sorrounded by new advances in technogy. This has become essential and indispensable to preform our daily activities. For example the internet has become very important tool and so essential that we cant stay with out internet for even a day. We costantly surfing the social media. even if we love and hate social media we are always conected. We want to know what others think about us. With out knowing we fall in a new world call internet and we make chages just to be acepted, love even hate by othes. Second we are part of a big sociaty. We born, grow up and died in a sociaty that has norms that we fallow. This norms sometime are written norms that are laws and if we brake this laws the sociaty can punish and we face consequences. Some norms are just unwriten norms that we fallow in our daily life. This norms can restrict our selve expretion and can stop us for doing what we want. So to fit and be aceted we fallow the social norms. For example if we go to school we must fallow thier rules to be able to get in school. We cant just walk in with a sexy litle dress and havy make up. The norms of the school are make for your to fallow the dress code. Even if you feel like the dress code restrict your personality and selve expretion. this norms are make for everyboby to mantain a the order and balance. In conclution I must said that I agree with Endersons quote "" to be yourself in a world that is costantly trying to make your something else is the greatest accomplishement."" therefore we emgrace new technology and follow social norms to keep the balance and maintain the order. We are part of a change together we can achieve new ideas and build a better sociaty. So we can leave a better future for our childrens.

308,3737,3C78D0790E7B,"Is Emerson right about the statement he wrote? Emersons statement stated that ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this statement because it lets you know that anyone can push for a higher acomplishment in their own life. As well, reading the passage gets people thinking on their goals, if they should push to reach for higher limits. Ill tell you why Emersons statement is right. As a start, many people are inspired by Emersons statement and its made them believe more in themself. Having a powerful statement can really open other peoples eyes to strive for high goals. As well, push boundries that they never thought they had. People with start to have faith knowing they can rise above their own expectations. For example, many people give up and stop trying to reach their goals. Then they have no idea on what they want to do or what they can manage to do. In fact, people who past beyond thier own boundries have a successful life style. They start to know what they can handle and how to fully succeed, It make them feel like they can complete any type of task that theyre given. People start to feel better on themself knowing what the can do. Some people say its a weight lifting feeling they get once they find out what they were missing out on. For example, people ened up over thinking things and made it harder on them self for not achiving the goals. As a matter of fact, People end up gaining more experiance on what they do. They also start to want to take on new challenges so they can have more experiance. They want to be filled with many different ways to have a strong mind and successful life style. People who has gained so much experiance can get any type of work within seconds because of their experiance, nothing has ever stop someone from believing they can do more. For example, people with the most experiance struggle less for work. In conclusion, Emersons statement shows a strong componet in peoples lifes. Making it one of the most insperational quotes that has ever existed. People start to end up valuing in themself more then they ever thought they could. People who cant do things that are beyond their own ability hasnt grown yet. Many of the people are too scared to reach for higher expectaions when they have the ability to take it.

309,253,E33FFA17ED69,"Thomas Jefferson once wrote,"" Determine never to be idle... it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Do we accomplish more if we are always doing something, or does inactivity serve a purpose. I agree with the quote by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done can accomplish more. Staying on track can help people focus. Some students from my school today lose track and end up not doing their work. Later on students fell unaccomplished from not doing the work and not accomplish anything. If students can focus and stay on track they can achieve more. By showing effort and working hard people can accomplish more. My mother works hard in the hot sun to accomplish her goals. My mothers goals are to work hard so she could pay bills, make sure her kids have what they need, and food on the table for her kids. My mother works hard just to show us if you do nothing in life you wont accomplish much. People achieve a lot more by getting things done. Soccer player Cristiano Ronaldo Pushed his team to the max by practicing every day to get things done, as a result from pushing his team and getting things done he lead his team to victory. Getting thing done is reaching for accomplishment and later on be an achievement. Although some people may say that inactivity severs a purpose, the real point to consider is that doing something can accomplish much more by staying on track, working hard, and getting things done will lead to accomplishing more.

311,3209,F7FD0CB34BBC,"Everyone has a talent or skill. For Example, my talent is drawing. Drawing is really useful because I can use it for a lot of things like school projects,plays,and more. To get good at something I enjoy doing it takes a lot of time and effort for me to be good at the activity i enjoy doing. Every one has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by hard work,practicing,and doing it constantly. Firstly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that skill is by working hard. For example,when I first started drawing. when I first started to draw i was really bad,cause i didnt practice at all. However,when I started to put that hard work in I started to get good at drawing and then i saw that I can only get better by working hard. Moreover,working hard is a chance for me to show my self what im capable of doing. Working hard is good for me because im challenging my self to do better in life as I get older and get better in my skills and talents. As can be seen,just by working hard can take someone far in life to achieve greatness. Secondly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by practicing it. For example, my friends talent is playing soccer. My friend is really good at soccer because he practices and trains everyday. Even though my friend is small and skinny he doesnt care who he plays against because he can play with people twice his size and double his weight and still play good. For example,one day I went to see my friend play in a tournament. The day of the tournament was beautiful because the sun was out,the sky was blue, and the temperature was perfect. After a few minutes of us waiting, the game finally started and we got to see my friend play. At the beginning of the match my friend was going through everyone because of how he was playing. My friend was running so fast that he looked like a cheetah running for the ball. After the match was over they ended up winning the whole tournament because they had the most points which made my friend really happy cause all that hard work had finally paid off. Later we went to eat at a restaurant which smelled like flowers and the food tasted like if it was from heaven. As can be seen,practicing can take people to achieve greatness. Lastly,everyone has a talent or skill but the only way to develop that talent or skill is by constantly doing it. For example,when my dad started to learn how to play the guitar. At first my dad was really bad because he had never played a guitar in his whole life,so he told his friend to teach him hot to play it. My dads friend told him everything he needed to know on how to play it,so my dad started playing the same notes constantly until he learn how to play it. Further more,having a talent is awesome because it can help people with daily day challenges. For example,if im playing a soccer match and my talent is playing soccer im going to do good,or if im in school and i have to do a project and my talent is drawing im going to get a good score because thats where im good at. As can be seen,practicing constantly can improve someones talents or skills. In conclusion,everyone has a talent or skill they just need to know how to develop that talent or skill.

312,3242,DB6B9E64CFF0,"All around the world involves people learning something new. We learn about different creatures, peoples ,and objects. An Individual that is willing to learn more each and everyday will succeed in life. Some people believe that Emerson statement ""unless someone try to do something beyond what theyve have already mastered will grow"", but I disagree. I believe people who try to do something beyond what theyve have already mastered, they will never grow because due to lack of experience, and not enough knowledge. To begin with, every individual want to become something in life. Theres literally a certain career that every individual is discovering for. People who wants to learn, participate in certain activities or classes would most likely get the dream career as they wish. Putting the effort is the answer to everyone problems. For instance, my friend Generic_Name shes a server at a restaurant. She is nineteen years old. Generic_Name has been working there since she was 17 years old already. Therefore, Generic_Name knows all of the meals that are served, places that need to be restocked etc. Unfortunately, she getting tired of the job. For some reason, she doesnt want to try something new. Having only one job experience is barely enough for the person to know about different experiences from other jobs. I strongly believe,as if Generic_Name does not put effort into applying for a new job. She will never grow out of her self esteem or confidence into getting a new job. Clearly, getting involved into different jobs will even give you different alternatives. Pursuing this further, knowledge is very important when it comes to trying something new. Individuals need to know atleast some knowledge when trying to reach further into their career For example, my eighth grade teacher Generic_Name would sometimes sit with me at lunch. We would discuss about anything. One day, I brought up about going into high school. Since my middle schools years were coming to an end. I asked her if their were any advice for my upcoming freshman year. She told me high school it will get harder . Also, I needed to become more serious about my education. Mostly likely I will have to pass all exams, sols ,and keep my GPA high. These are the years I will0 start thinking about what I want to do with my career. She gave me advice to guide me through to become better. I strongly oppose, knowing more knowledge about something will make yourself grow. Obviously, if an individual is trying to do something beyond then what theyve already mastered, they will never grow. Just by having lack of experience will lead the individual feeling in their comfort zone. Also, the lack of knowledge will leave the person clueless. Some people may argue that unless the person try to do something beyond what they have mastered, they will grow. How can someone grow from repeating on doing what they do on a normal basis? How can they learn something new with such little knowledge? For example, my dad came to United States when he was 14 years old. He knew little English. Also, he knew how to write some words, but that was all that he knew. He put his full time effort to learn a new language. Each step he took he accomplished. He himself grew out of the stage of not knowing something. He went beyond into what he really wanted. Finally, everyone needs experience and knowledge in order to grow. Imagine doing a science project on an unknown animal. Surprisingly this creature changes colors, sizes, and shape. Wouldnt you want to invest in the creature more? Learn how the creature lives? Or you would just want to know the basic facts of it? ",8,8,7,8,7,8,3091,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 8"
313,1023,408A7D3D2EEC,"Imagine seeking advice from multiple people and choosing the best decision that suits you. How does that make you feel? Asking for advice can be defined as someone who asks help from multiple people and makes the right decision. Seeking multiple opinions can help someone make a better decision because they can see which advice is better, more experienced, and see the persons point of view. Asking advice from multiple people can help you see which advice is better. Lets say this person needs to ask their teacher what book to choose. But, they also asked their friends the same question. They can now see which decision is better for them. It also depends if the advice is decent or not because if the advice is horrible, then that decision you make can affect the outcome. Another way asking advice from multiple people can help you is they might have more experience. For instance, they need help picking a collage that suits their interest. When they ask their parents for advice, the parent might pick a different collage that could be better. But, thats because they have more experience and can see whats best for them. Grandparents especially, went through a lot when they were kids. So, if you need advice, ask adults who are more experienced in life! Lastly, asking advice from multiple people can help you see the persons point of view. For example, they can see what other people have to say and can help you make that better decision. Lets say they need help painting their house but dont know what paint color to choose. But, when they ask someone for advice, they can see what the other person has to say and make the right decision based on that advice. In conclusion, asking advice can help someone make a better decision because they can see the persons point of view, more experienced, and they can see which advice is better. Asking for advice is important because they can see which advice is better and can see other peoples perspective.

Theirs a reason why people get stuck in life, when they master their subject. They get fustrated when they cant find jobs or good pay wage. I agree on what Author Ralph Waldo Emereson because if you dont have that motivation on what you master it can affect you. If you dont push yourself into doing more than beyond than life will not treat you as you wanted. I agree on Author Ralph because Ive experience things in life that if you dont try on something , than you wont be able to grow. If you look at bill gates he master on his program and what did he do he share his product and open stores. He grew just by mastering his program. My experience was mastering in learning how rebuild a engine from just the block to how to make more power. Now im fixing peoples cars and doing tunes for their cars. I know these guys that called themself diesel brothers. They are master diesel technician. So what did they do? They bought a shop , got a crew and got sign to do a tv show. They work on diesel trucks, diesel cars and anything that is diesel. Then they decided to do custom trucks and custom military cars. That wasnt enough for them, so they came up with ideas to use military axles and putting them on custom trucks making those trucks so heavy duty they can even pull a train! My father told me that you should never stop, even if you reach that goal. He said,"" you reach that goal make another goal, you cant stop at what your doing and if you do,than theirs going to be bumps in the road and than your going to make huge mistakes."" just from those words its like million bucks to me. Why because if you stop at what you master ,than somebody is going to master it better than you ever thought and your not going to grow from it. When they master their subject, those people get happy right but whats next? Lets say you master your subject and than you find a job that pays good. The money looks good and you stay at that job for a couple of years. Id say that probably 75 percent of you staying at that job will make your miserable. People get bored and cant find nothing else to do,but do the exact samething over again. Its going to make you want ot quit and find something else to do. Then once you quit your job whats going to be in your mind? Probably nothing at the moment,but then your realize that you master that subject and want to share it, make it to your own business and improve from it. So I do agree on what Author Ralph waldo Emerson wrote. I believe that if you dont go beyond your goal than you wont succeed in life. So make sure that you push yourself even if its harder. I promise you that you will succeed,have better thought, better examples and freedom. Remember having to do more you will get more in return.

323,1842,E21C97204867,"Changing the cafeteria food for students would be like taking a bone away from a dog. One of the reasons why changing the school lunch would be a bad idea is because, students that attend the school would not be happy with the change. When students are unhappy with changes of the schools sometimes parents can get involved and that brings a bad reputation for the school board. One day I was watching a show and they were making school changes without the students or parents consent and it turned into a big thing. Students were so angry the went on a ""strike"" and refused to go to school. Another reason why taking away students favorite food would be a bad idea is because students would stop eating at school. For example, when I went to a family dinner they made meat loaf and I absolutely hated it, I couldnt bring myself to finish it and I felt extremely bad but i had to throw it away. Another example is also similar to my last one but, one day my friends and I went to a buffet and they didnt have a lot options to choose from, we ended up getting these wings and it was just awful we could not eat it all. When people see things they do not like then they most likely will not eat it or even try it out. Lastly, changing the cafeteria food would leave students with less options to choose from. It would be unfair for those who dont like what they are serving and they would have nothing else to eat. Look at it like this, its like when you go out to your favorite shopping store and they have taken out all the clothes you loved so much about that store and they replaced it with clothes you hate. You would be very unsatisfied if that wouldve happen to you. Thats what students would feel if the school lunch were to change. Some people say that changing to a healthier school lunch would be a lot better for students; Although, this is a good point, its wrong because it misses the fact that some students would be unhappy with this decision. These are some reasons on why changing the menu would be a bad idea for the school. ",7,8,6,6,7,7,3240,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

Have you ever heard people saying ""i want to go to the movies but i have go to the store."" I bet there is people out there. they like to go out, but they have so much to do that they cant and is not a problem because we have technology that can help us with stuff that we need without going to the store or deal with people humors. also, you can save time to use it in another activities like you can go and have fun with the family or friends. however theres people that theyre against technology, and everyone has they opinion about it. Unfortunately we still have technology that we can use it. Theres people who like to use technology because its a new way to see the world. they can get so much done using technology like they can create new things like: new cars, new smart-phones, new styles of clothing, and so much more like its unique way to see what can technology do for us without taking us so much time. But they are people who still think that doing stuff in the old way is the same, i mean everyone has the own description of things. personally i think without technology will take us so much to make new stuff so unfortenely technology we get done some amazing things. In todays society technology has been doing so much like helping students by doing their homeworks, and i think Technology is great, it just depends how do you use it and what do you want to do with it. yes some people would say that technology has done so much damage in kids brains but however kids are leaning faster and theyre using their imagination to do whatever they want.

327,568,58567312BDAB,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way online or video conferencing. Students would not benefit from being able to attent classes from home because: students would not have a social communication with their classmates, students would not ask questions to the teacher for help when they need it, and students would not participate in class activies or projects. Firstly, students would not have a social communication with their classmates because students are taking classes at home, there is not a way to meet new friends. For example, in the school students would know different types of people, races,and cultures. Also, students would know each other, share special moments, and have a friendship. Secondly, students would not be able to ask questions to the teacher because they are at home, taking classes online, sometimes students get confused or they have some question but they can not ask to the teacher. For example, students do not understand something, it is hard for them to ask about it because there is not a teacher who would answer all the questions that they need or if they are doing a homework and they get confused, it would be hard for them to finish it because they do not know if they are doing right or wrong their homework. Thirdly, students would not be able to participate in class activities or projects because they are taking classes by themselves at home. For example, in the school, students can work in groups projects, expositions, and activies. Moreover, when students work in groups, they can learn how other students work, the tecniques that they use and skill that they have. In contrast, some students would benefit for taking classes online from home because, students feel safety at home, some students live far away of the school and they do not have transportation.

328,3763,EF45D0314A20,"Almost 95% of people goes to the beach or swimming pools, and I imagined what enjoyable activity to do. I think swimming club is the most enjoyable activity. Swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever im mad, I can also swim with my friends and play together, and it is also more easier and exciting to exercise whenever im swimming. First of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm whenever im mad or feeling down. Last year, when the school just finished, and all of the people left, I jumped into the pool and just swam. It made me happy because as I swam into the surface of the water, I heard the water droplets drop as I moved my feet up and down, the sound of the wave made me sleepy as they touched the wall, and the sound of the gushing water that made me feel alive as I went out of the pool. Another example would be, when I was on a field trip, we all went to the beach and stayed there for two days. As the day goes by, I was sad and upset because I didnt want to leave. What I did was I changed my clothes, took my camera, and went outside. As I walk on the sandy beach, I heard the waves as if they were ready to eat me, I heard the birds chirping as I take a picture of them. It was a very fun and calm day. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because it helps me calm. Second of all, swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends, even make new friends! An example would be when I was swimming alone, I was okay because I dont really mind being alone, but when my friends came, they instantly made me laugh. All of us were doing tricks and racing with each other, which is very fun. One time, when my friends was swiming underwater, they bumped each others head and as they reach to the surface, three of us laughed. Also, learning how to swim is easier because swimming is fun, and its more fun with your friends. An example would be your friend can help you out when youre struggling how to float. Even doing dog swim is hard for some people, which is easy for me. Also, learning by yourself isnt fun, learning with your friends is more fun. That is why swimming is an enjoyable activity because you get to swim with your friends. Lastly, swimming is an enjoyable activity because its mpre exciting to exercise when youre swimming. I once took a swimming lesson every friday after school. I didnt like it at first, but as soon as my third day came, I liked it so much. I gained 145 pounds for a ten year old, but when I took my swimming lesson, my weight decreased to 111 pounds. You dont really see the result, until you started having fun on what youre doing. An example would be I was really not into swimming and all I wanted to do there is to lose weight. I didnt see any improvement onj my swimming skills, and I didnt lose weight at all. Weeks passed and I started losing weight, and im becoming more better at swimming. I thought is because I got more passionate and determined when swimming that I didnt see those changes. After all what ive been through, swimming made me happy at all times. That is how swimming impacted my life. Its more exciting and easier to exercise when swimming, you can swim with your friends and play together, and it helps me calm whenever im mad, and that is why swimming is an enjoyable activity. It is important for people to know this is because this is a real life story. It already helped three people when they read this.

329,2235,9E2645222231,"Although some says that inactivity serve a purpose, because the can get more time to them selves then when they are in activities, actually determine never to be idle, because we can accomplish many things; If we are always doing somethings such as involving in activities, having more time with our book, and trying out new things. It had been writing by Thomas Jefferson "" Determine never to be idle "". It is very true that some many people and students are always idle; they dont use their time wisely. We can do a lot if we involved our selves in activities instead of been idle; for example, when I came to the United States in January 8,2017. I was sitting at home for two months without going to school, and doing nothing. I got tired of been idle, so I told my mother that I wanted to something instead of been idle. I wanted to sign up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, so that I can get busy with my time, and use it wisely. I finally signed up for the Generic_City Soccer Team, and I got accepted by the coach. I started training with new people, and I made a lot of friends. Instead of been idle, why cant we spend more time with our books? The more we go close to our books the more we learn faster, and increase our skills in reading; for example, my friend Generic_Name, his parents never wanted him to hang out with friends that much, or neither been idle without having his book to read. Generic_Name kept on spending most of his time reading his books for a long time, and he became a good reader in his English classroom. The teacher always asked him to read out story books and passages to his classmates in school. He inspired many students in his school, and most students wanted to be like him, so they started having more time with their books at home. In addition, people who wanted to be idle, or people who think inactivity serve a purpose are people who are not determine, and not planing on their future; they dont want to involve in activities, or interact with people. Idle people are lazy, because they dont want to try out new things. try out new things when ever you are idle. You can learn a lot even if you are not perfect; for example, me and my three friends Generic_Name, Generic_Name and Generic_Name. We were sitting at home idly doing nothing; until when Generic_Name suggested that we should go and try out the UFC GYM. We went there, and signed up for the training; they gave us a one day trail to see if we would like the training. We went there the next day and started training for one hour; after training I told my friends that I dont like the training, because it was gave me back pains, so I quit the gym, and my three stayed in the training, because they like it. I was not perfect, but I tired out a new thing and I got some experiences from it. As a result of all the reasons and examples. I encourage every idle human and people who thinks inactivity server a purpose to get engage in activities, having more time with their books, and trying out new things when ever they feel like they are idle. You can do a lot if you try out new things. We can accomplish more if we are always doing somethings; therefore, determine never to be idle.",7,7,8,7,6,8,2107,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
330,1259,5EFF1BA0FBC1,"Although the extra time would benefit students. Some people dont wanna stay after school because they are already tired from staying 7 hours at school. Because school can cause stress if you are forced to do much work. I disagree because the school board is adding it to our day. They should add a after school program for kids who need help with homework. Because if they add it for everyone then we would get out of school late. And we would barley have time to do homework. On the other hand if they add it everyday then a lot of kids will be stressed. Because when they come back if they have homework,or projects to work on then they might stay up all night working on it and come to school the next day .And they will probably be grumpy or stressed. My second reason is The teachers will also be tired and stressed because if we leave school first. Then that means they leave after us. Also they have to grade our papers and other stuff so adding extra time to school will not be a great idea because the teachers can turn mean from all the stress. They can sleep from being too tired and then that means we wont get to learn anything. And dont forget that the teachers have a normal life too. They have families that they want to see so if the school board adds extra time then that teachers might not see their families often because they will probably be too busy grading our work. So i think that the school board should not add the time. Because if they do then they will mess everything up like peoples sleep schedule,The time they might go somewhere. So over all i think that the time we leave school right now is good. Because people have enough time to do their work and projects,and to get enough sleep. So the time we have now is good because everything is balanced.

332,653,F5CB9849B913,"To accomplish something there is always gonna be some inactivity once and a while. Well everyone has their own different type of way to accomplish something, but there is always some kind of inactivity at times; but not always. I think that we really do accomplish more when there is something else happening. Everyone in this world is different compared to the next person. Everyone has their own unique style of completing an assignment. Some examples are Listening to music , working outside, working with someone else, and basically anywhere else. These small things can help somebody to Stay in task to complete something. Myself personally I love to be listening to music to get my assignments done. I am able to accomplish more than what I usually do. Before i never got my school work completed cause i was really bored of doing it, but when I first played music. I was flowing threw to get my work done. Sometimes when trying to accomplish anything in life. Some people may experience some inactivity. Two things that happen the most to people are Zoning out or a phone notification. These two things are what happens to people the most, But they can always prevent it from happening. Me for myself i love using my phone. I never get bored of it. Sometimes while im working to get my assignments done and complete. There will always be a notification that will make my phone go ""Buzz buzz"" and then ill have the courage to see what it is. Now I have overcome that. What i do now is i put my phone on silent away from me while its connected to my Bluetooth speaker playing music. This always helps me from zoning out. Music playing in the background prevents me from zoning out. some people can complete everything without a doubt, But not everyone could stay on task to complete something to accomplish it. We all had accomplish something in this world; but some people havent accomplish anything at all. Their minds are not set for reality I must say. Their minds are inactive and not set for anything. People can change. Anything can happen. Nothing in this world is really impossible, well if you set your mind to it. People dont believe in themselves to Accomplish anything. The inactivity that they got can change. Before i used to never get anything completed/Accomplish. I was thought I wasnt enough to do anything. I always made bad choices. My mind wasnt set for anything. I didnt care. I thought my life was a joke and soon it will be over as soon as I know it. School was hard. I didnt really get anything done. I was never the perfect student. My grades were bad. I had no faith in myself. I thought i could not do anything right. I never accomplished anything. The only thing I could accomplish is messing up everything. School, at home, In a public area, Anywhere. I made bad choices back in my pass; But now its completed different.

I had accomplish to change my life. I saw the success. It wasnt hard. I just had to believe in myself to do it. If I could change then i know people in this world can change also. Although accomplishing something no matter if its simple, Difficult, short, or long. Its still better off to accomplish it even tho there is always gonna be a little bit of inactivity, and its okay there are always a way to over come it. Everyone can always change.

334,3370,F4BE7BB77A43,"Tomas Jefferson say is wonderful how much may be done if always diong. And is one of the reason I deagree with Jomas because if the person always doing something learning stuff they never before do. Is wonderful how much the person can be do and learning new stuff if always work hard. One of the many reason of the human is a intelligent,stroong,smart and do new stuff no matter if they are easy or difficult. If they work hard can be do everithing. For example the human not born with the capacity to walk or speak all human learng how do new stuff not matter how dificult ther are because more do more learng. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life,is not easy but diong something to make sure the person is in the right way is the most important things the person need to know. Teaching personality and work hard is the big stuff, however one point of life the thing come hard but teaching how go and do resolve the problem. Not matter how be is the problem you need to go and do something then make how strong the person are. The person need to struggle with problems but learning and work hard is the main reason why the person is strong. On one point has the access to take something and work on that, but doing something is how learning new need stuff. Example the person who invent the technology they work hard and always do somethig to make they dream to come real and thas why diong somethihg and do the best potential is how make all the stuff of life. The person who study and prepare to make thay dreams are those work and not matter hoe big is the way they make one aesy way to continue they dream. Doing somethigs always is the reason why the society do big work define new thing new technology new life becuase always are doing somethis. The person not born with all the intelligent not they learn how walk,speak and one point of life they go to school they not know everything. Not they do something the work hard, however a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better because they want to suppor the world and they family a better place. Likely the most professional always do something to make sure they life are excel of the most difficult piont of they life becuase always work hard and make new things, because not matter how low they education the person take always can be a better person because always try to define the best decition and the best example to the society. A different way to make the personality strong is find new ways to the problem. Life is like a game more things more work more aesy is to make the things. If the person always are diong something new and the not choose to stay an d the same place all the time. And the person choose to continue doing new stuff and new work they not need to be the most smart person on the world. They need to work and show they can be do,however they walt to be not matter if they how be a stong personality and not matter is theyt go the best school or the best college. Only matter how they be and the profession and the work. If the person or the society do somethig they can be the future. For example one day the person get up and choose to do something and make sure they days are very beautiful do new projects they can be came be make they life more aesy to continue. Life and work are like a gardener more flowes the person add more beautiful they came to be is like work more thing you learng more easy life come. one point they persono cant be continue but all the things thy learn more aesy came to be going up. That why more things do make goals they persons can find, not matter were the person came or were the born always doing something more intellegent the person can to be. However a lot person are very smart but they continue to learn always doing something because they want to a better or find new technology or make a different on this world. One of the big point of always do somehing is prepare for life. All the persons are not the same one they has more technology to they dream,but others person not and this is not one obstacle to make they dream. Because all the time are be doing something and not wait to came things came not they go find and work hard to make all be came to be positibe they not have obstacles they have the strong to be come a better person. And show everyone not matter how difficult are the problem they came be successfuly person. Like Thomas Jefferson say always diong somethings much be done and is true because the person came to this life and learng everything, a lot person move to other place, need to learng need lenguage, need tradititiones and need people is hard but with the time can be learnig everything and continue the life again with need stuff thas is what is important to always diong on and be done what they need to be done and make sure do the best and hork hard and show a good and strong personality. And accomplish more if always theyre something on specific point of life can to be so difficult but working hard and with discipline all can be come more aesy and undertake a new dream and new stuff of life can be come the best tool to widely and known as the most expert guidance to life. Base of all the information always doing somethig more thigs can be done and the persons can be accomplish and determine what strong thye personality they are.",5,5,7,5,4,4,3630,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
335,1942,327AAC23CF5D,"On my Opinion i think is a good way to the student that they can take classes on online or on video chat is a good way to do it, because some students sometimes some of then they live so far of the school so they dont have other way to educate they self and i think is a good communication to learn. Is a good benefit because is a easy way to do it, easy and fast and is good too because sometimes some days is snowing and when is snowing all school are closed. And they close the school because the students can not trasportate to the like that because the streets are freeze and really complicate to transport to the school. If i have to take classes on online or video chat i will because more easy for me and is not difficult to learn on online or video chat.

336,3563,D6C9DE61BAF4,"There are three examples about if I agree or desagree about the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life"". I agree with this statement about the importance of attitude and I will give some reasons. Firts example, one reason that why I agree with this statement is because,if you want to apply for a job, you need to have a positive attitude to be sucessful for other people because they want to see the best of you and if you can have that job and how you relate with other people and you will see the results about it . Many people with bad attitude are lay off of their work because at work you have to show your best attitude with the costumers,boss or with other workers but some people dont do it . If you are the boss, you needs to have a positive attitude or try to have it because your workers hope the best attitude of you to manage the job and that can show respect of your person. Second example, another reason that why I agree with this statement is because all people desserve positive attitude like, if you are walking at the park and you say ""hi"" or ""have a good day"" to other person with a positive actitude they will feel good and they would think that you are a good person . Be a person with a positive attitude can be successful for yourself or for your family for example, if one of the family members has a bad day and they see you, his mood can change because of your positive attitude, you make him feel better with advices about how he needs many options to resolve his life but if you have a bad attitude you make him feel irate of you. Third example, the last reason that why I agree with this statement is because, if you are in the school there are many teenager like you that have hard classes, but some of them have a positive attitude because they want to have a good grades, pay attention in class and try to help other students who needs it, they try to make them sucessful too, so they can have a good grades or a good future . But, if they have a bad attitude they would be have bad grades,they dont pay attention in class,they try to distract the students who want to pay attention,make argument about the class or sometimes they scape the class because they feel that they have a bad attitude and thats why it has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life. In conclusion,in this three examples I give reasons that why I agree or desagree with the statement ""It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life"". If you have a positive attitude that can make you a better person or successful for yourself and other people.",6,5,6,7,5,7,2997,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
337,782,4F7F24918F42,"As a student myself, I think students would benefit from attending classes from home, because attending classes can help students manage their own time and learn how to self control, and can follow their own pace of learning. As day by day passes, I believe that lots of students are sick of repeating the same dull sketchual, and wish they could stay at home for school, on the other hand, they will not have to wake up so early everyday when they worked on their homework till so late. When students attend classes from home, they will be able to manage their own sketchual, learn how to control their time efficiently, be more self-reliance, and prepare for the future. In conclusion, it is a benefit for students to attend classes from home, because they can learn how to make their own plan, and learn how to manage time, which I believe that it will help the students a lot in their jobs, future life goals or even their entire life.",8,9,9,9,9,9,1041,"conventions 9, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
338,1326,B5FF33681C22,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more. Attending a school can get you ready in the real world then just attending classes from home. Those who say attending classes from home say that because teacher cant teach the way they want. They have to follow the way the schools wants you to learn. For example, the teacher does not want to teach some of the stuff hes given but he has to because at the end of the day this is his job and he does not want to lose his job. When your attending classes from home you have more sleep and you wont be tired because it will be at your own time. And also you dont have to be in a class that the teacher dont really like to teach because over time some teachers lose that feeling that they loved. However, people believe that attending schools is way better then just staying home. Some reasons you should attend school then stay home is that you will have more fun in a class room then just home all the time. For example, you will make friends and do stuff together the will make your time more joy able then just at home. you wake up and go to school you see your friends and you make jokes and help each other and it is limitless. Another reason you should attend school then classes at home. Schools have field trips,sports,after school activities that you will probably love to do. Because you have the chance to try all of them at school. For example, there are filed trips to the art museum that have great at works like the monalisa. And filed trips to New York and other places that you will love to see. Sport teams are like family, you watch each others back and help improve you game together and thats something you cant get from home or video conferencing. Other reason why you should attend school with others is that someday you will find a bond with someone or a group that will last and you will be grateful for. For example, There were couples in high school that later on got married and there were these groups that became friends actually the became family. In conclusion, Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Some believe that attend classes from home is not great for the student. But others think that if you attend classes from home you learn so much more.

In my own opinion i say i would agree in my 17 years on this earth that i have to agree because if you stay to comfortable you wont do anything in life you will want it all easy and not try to strive for the best version of yourself. you can stay comfortable but it wont help because your just wasting time and effort that you could become a better human being and spread your knowledge with other people. You should always try to strive to become the best you can be. I say people should agree on this because not trying to fix your or improve yourself is not the best way to go. Like they shouldnt disagree i say because it not a bad or good thing but it would be amazing to push yourself and be more educated get pain a lot for having that big of a knowledge and use it think help people that cant help themselves. us humans should help everyone we can even if its little people sometimes dont ask for help but if they dont ask you tell them you need help. Some people also may disagree because they might think only about themselves or they think that there at a good point that they dont have to try anymore or try there very best they think thieve mastered the problems and situations. They think that they cant learn anything else but there wrong we human beings can always learn something more strive to be better humans, father,mothers,sons,daughters etc... but the point is dont settle for okay do more. We Should learn not to stay cozy you should try to improve a bit everyday or learn something new help yourself and help each other out if they need help or if you need it learning and talking to other people wont hurt you so like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"" is a true fact and you should try to be a better human or person in life and become someone that people can look up too.",5,6,6,6,6,5,2927,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
342,1434,17085E68BA88,"Personally, I have been able to find myself to be able and do more when Im up and active, as in doing something good for me, someone else, or in general. Its like youre able to do more once youre up and you are able to tell yourself that you can do better and you can do more than what youre supposed too. As Jefferson said ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Sometimes you can be so into the work and time can fly and you can get so much done with no distractions. When I am doing something positive for myself and I want to do more, I find me telling myself a lot ""what good will this do to me?"" or ""where will it get me?"" Im sure that Im not the only one asking myself questions like these when I want do something good for myself or my life. When we are doing something for us, we can ask ourselves questions like the ones I stated. Once we do more than what we want to do and keep a positive mindset about it, that can be able to stick with us and become a good habit we can carry on in our lives. Which is amazing. Well be able to strive for the best for ourselves and others when we carry on a good habit like that and show others how much we care about not just ourselves but others as well. We can always be able to carry a positive mindset with us and we can pass that on to others and itll be able to motivate people to do more than what we can do once we are up and doing something. I really tend to look at the bright side a lot and look at what is at the end or the outcome, when Im trying to strive for the best by doing the absolute best that I can. We may have our moments where we can get tired of doing the most, but then we are able to tell ourselves how much the hard work is worth at the end when we do the most of what were supposed too. Once we do the best that we can, we can reflect on it later on in life and be so proud of ourselves and tell ourselves how tired we were for doing the most but how much worth it all was at the end. I have my moments where I can be so tired of trying my best and just want to give up. But then I take a step back, look at my work, and once Im done and I tell myself how proud I am because it got me far. We also are able to have no regrets at the end of the day and reflect on it and see how dedicated we were and still are to this day. We can tell others our story and say how proud you are for yourself and see how dedicated you were and still are for doing what you can and doing better. Not in any bragging type of way but to motivate them in a way. Youre able to pick up the habit of being so dedicated to bettering yourself or others by doing more once youre doing. Its like self motivation, telling yourself ""you can do more."" Once we pick up this good habit of accomplishing more than what we are supposed too, we motivate not just ourselves, but others as well to do more and more. Like I said, we can look at the bright side of it always, and feel nothing but good and proud of ourselves at the end. When we build this good habit and do the most, we are able to do the more than what we could before and little by little building that up. At the end of accomplishing what you could, you are able to tell others what the hard work and dedication gives you at the end of it all. As well as how far it gets you in life. It can sometimes motivate others to strive for the best and it can help them, sometimes they need to hear you out for it to motivate them. What I like about it is that, when we are able to pick up this good habit of ours, we can tell others about it and it can motivate them to do the same. Its like we talk them into to striving for the best for themselves and others in life. Its like we are passing this good habit weve built down and then it just keeps going and going. Sometimes hearing others out really helps others a lot. When you are able to just take a moment and take one step back, it really is possible for you to accomplish more than what you can when youre doing. You motivate not just yourself but others when you really are dedicated to doing your best and it can become a good habit. Youre able to pass that down and it can give you a positive mindset to it all. The outcome can turn out to be good and make you feel good about yourself at the end. It can get you so far in life as well and youre able to look back at the most that you have accomplished and have no regrets about any of it. It is truly motivational and can truly help if you are really dedicated to it all.",7,8,8,8,9,8,317,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

It now the time to choose the leader,they both seat separately with their heart beating vastly,the lady living a fake life have the 100% assurance that she will wi the contest, here comes the judges to call our the winner,the speaker gives a speech about each of them. The speech goes as; After we have camp both ladies for some month will we sure;y choose the leaders but here with me some evidence about those ladies,their is girl among you two who lives a fake life to get what she want and there is another girl who didnt do that, this position is given to the girl who does not leave the fake live because if this position is given to you who live fake life you will surely ruin this company by embezzled and faking this company,the speaker says she borrowed almost $500,000 from banks,two house and 3 brand new cars to fake her life and at the end she did not accomplish what she want,likewise the other girl who be herself in this world and finally fulfill her dream and have greatest accomplishment. With this little words of mine i will like to convinced not to confused you that living your real life in this live that is constantly trying to male you something else is the greatest accomplish but if you try and fake your life in this world you will never accomplish anything than public disgrace if you later got caught.",5,6,7,7,6,6,2252,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

I think students they will benefit with this idea, because they are not going to spend that much money, In traveling to school eveyday. It will be so much easier taking classes only, because students will have more free time to do their own things, after theyre done with all their schoolo work at home: for example; if the students works it will be a better option of taking classes only because he/she will have more time in getting ready for work, and been on time to work. Reasons why I say it will be a better option taking the classes only or video conferencing, Its because students they dont have to worry, about gettig in trauble for been late to school, Because if students will travel to school schoool, there will be a high posibility of not getting to school on time sometimes it can be for many reasons; for example: traffict issus, parents they might get sick or any other reason, It will be really hard for this students if schools wouldnt offer away to study and learn at home, schools they make it easier for this students who arent able to come to school, Myself as student i think this is a really good idea made by the school, Bacuse it gives students the oportnity of study at home when they arent caplable to show up to school for this type of reasons. I am agree with schools that offers distance learning as an option for the students, Because some students dont have the ability as others students, That has the oportunity of riding the bus to school everyday from Monday to Friday, This students who takes online classes is because they really need it, And they dont have a way of getting to school eveyday , It might be more difficult for them , because they might not have someone to explain them as well as a teacher. Another reason why i think some students students take only classes is because some classes that they like, some school dont have them, and they really want to know about it, Aslo sometimes parents look trought schools to see the classes option they have online so they can apply to see if their sons can takes those classes online to learn about it. One of the major reason why student take classes online sometimes is because they dont have enaught credits, so they have to take classes online, Becuase even if they come to school they wont be able to graduate because they dont have all the credits needed, Some students dont live near the schools to come all the way to school so they decide to take the classes at home.",5,4,5,5,6,5,1133,"conventions 5, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Curfew keeps teenager out of trouble after midnight on weekends and after 10 pm on weekdays. It will keep them safe, healthy, and smart. The curfew will keep teenagers safe. Most of teenagers like to party at midnight. Some of them like to have alcohol at party. It is illegal to have alcohol under age of 21. There are many issues that will concern their safety. Someone can bully them and also most crimes happens at night time. One day I asked my mom to go at party with my friends at night. She did not allowed me to go at party, at that time I was badly mad at her. In the morning, I heard that my some of friends got caught by police because they were having alcohol. At this point of time I thought my mom was mean but after hearing a story, I thanks to my mom for not allowing me to go at party. I was safe at home while others girls were in trouble. The lesson that I got from this story is that never break rules and it is better to stay home at night because of safety issues. Curfew will keep teenagers healthy. A normal person should have sleep of maximum eight hours. When teenagers go out at weekdays it really effect their health because they have to go to school in the morning. If you are not healthy it will effect your studies. A person health should be a first priority. Most teenagers are not mature enough curfew will keep them healthy. There was a day when I was out with my friends on shopping. We went to mall together. I went back at home at 12:30 pm, than in morning I went to school. I did the same routine for a week. After that I started getting sick. It effected my brain. I went to doctor they said it happened because of lack of sleep. After that I try to sleep at 9:30 everyday, now I am feeling much healthier and stronger. The more you will get good sleep the better your health will be. Curfew will keep teenagers smart. Most of teenagers like to study at night unless they get distracted by extra stuff. Teenagers go school in the morning some of them do extracurricular activities. They are busy in the day, so they like to have fun at night. They dont do their homework because they go out at night. It effects their studies really bad. If teenagers stay at home at nights they can complete their homework and get a good night sleep. In tenth grade, I used to play basket ball everyday after school. I never had time to spend quality time with my friends. I started going out at night and also, skipping my homework. After a week, I checked my grades I had ""D"" in my three classes. My mom also got a call from school that I am not doing good in my classes. My mom got really upset on me. She stopped me going out at night. I started working on my homework. Now I have very good grades in class. The curfew will help a lot of teenagers with their studies. It will keep them smart and intelligent. There should be a curfew for teenagers after 10 pm on weekdays and midnight curfew on weekends. Curfew will stop them because if they go out at night they will be breaking the rules. If teenagers follow the rule they will be protected, strong and intelligent. So, safety is the first priority. Everyone should follow rules because it will be best for them.

I think it is a good idea if you identify the carrer that you want to take and start getting into it at a young age, because you will have more time to know and study about it and how it works, and it is gonna be more easy. It could be difficult if at the end of the day you are about to gratuate and you do not even know what career do you wanna take. One of the reasons why you have to decide what career you wanna take by the time you enter high school is that, you will focus in all your classes, but more in those classes that are related with your career, and you progress in school is gonna increase, and also your grades. You will be busy in a productive way doing things that will benefit you in school, because if you really wanna reach your goals you will not have chance to waste your time, which is a good thing, instead doing nothing, bad thing, or only in video games. As how we are today, many teens are leaving school because maybe they think they found a better thing to do or because they took a bad decition. But for those who really wanna be someone in the future and go for it, will have more opportunities, like Univercities credits and in their future job by dedicating their interest in school and doing their best. Another reason is that your knowledge is gonna increrase, which is also a good thing, because you will learn a little bit about everything.

All those are benefits that you can get by dedicating your interest in school.

I started to do more pranks on them but the pranks started to get boring they were no more good ideas. My new ideas were using the pranks in new ways. Not what they were designed to do in new creative ways like putting a cockroach under a cookie that idea went really well it scared a lot of people that was one of my creative pranks. my second one was. It was called Valentines through the hand box. This one took a little bit more effort then the rest of them because you had to cut a big hole through the box that was the size of your hand. How this work was on Valentines I would of gave someone a big box that is the shape of a heart and cover the bottom of the box were the hand would go in and they would open it and a hand would pop out at them. this is how I started to develop to use pranks to make people laugh. I still use these pranks I buy them off Amazon and at 5 Below. Now I .use the prank more on teachers for the most part and how I use it is is in public I place a fake poop on the ground and people got disgusted and I once had a robot cockroach made people freak out.

It is important for me if I choose a career at the young age because when I am taking a career when the teacher ask me the question that time I can easily give them the answer. If I do the really good about a career course then one time ill get success in my life. Its important for me because if I finish about a career course ill get a job or ill do the business. If I do the really good about a career course what I choose one day ill get success in my life. If I get success in my life ill be so happy and also my family will be happy. In Conclusion, if I choose a career at a young age its good for me and when Im taking the career course its easy to take it. One day ill be success in my life and ill be so happy and my family and we will stay happy.",7,6,6,7,7,7,3571,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
350,664,757C5E55BA96,I think it is a good idea that people should ask for others peoples advice because they can learn extra info from them. Because if you tell multiple people for an advice they can get more opinions from people. They can also get help someone make a better choice. You might learn different opnions from alot of different people and they can give you alot of advice on what not to do and what you should do. Its smart because if people ask for other peoples opinions they will get more ideas and facts and what they should do next. The second reasons why I think people should ask multiple questions to a variet of different people is because so they can get alot of responses and more answers to their questions. The more people ask for advice they will get multiple opinions. If I dont ask questions iill never get any responses or advices. So thast why I think people should ask for others peoples advice all the time. ,6,7,6,6,7,5,1527,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
351,572,0F8F499BAAB9,"I think it is a good idea for students to select a career at a young age by the time they enter high school. Because for example right now I am in high schools in eleven grade and I dont know what career I want to take it. I agree with the societies that do students expected to identify a career, at that way they are gonna know what career they want, some students likes more than one career and they dont know which to decided before they graduated.. They are others students that the career that they want it is to expanses and they dont have enough money to pay they can try to get like a scholarship with having good grades and they have to stars in nine grade with good grades and they can apply for one later and see if they can get it. I agree that the students select a career at a young age, at that way they are prepared and when they graduated of high schools that are gonna go to college ad choose a good career, and than after that get a good job.

352,768,C8EF7048C03F,"When youre looking for advice, you might not go to the same exact person. Hopefully you do talk to more than one person to make a better choice and give up the less opportunity cost. Most people talk to more than one person to see their other options instead of putting all one decision into one persons own opinion. One thing I like about talking to multiple people for advice is that they can give you so many open options to pick and decide from. Most likely if all the people you talk to about advice or help, you will pick what they have choose. Which can be good or it could lead to a bad cause. Your always gonna have a opportunity cost. You either make a good or a bad move, which can lead in different directions. including the rest of your life, your mood for the rest of the day, the improvement, or the impact. There are multiple options that can occur. Another reason this option is good is because you can hear all the others peoples opinions about your choice and you can mark out the ones you have already happened to you in a perfect or an awful way. You can also, pick their opinions or options and learn from it either if its gonna be a bad time or a good time. After you have learned you can help out the ones in your same position or a little more different. But still can be able to help others in need. You can learn from it and help others or you can learn from it and help yourself in the future if you ever come upon the same situation. Or even teach the ones need in teaching One dislike I dont like about talking to a couple of people for advice, is hearing their opinions and advice it could possibly change your mind of you were thinking about before, But also it could be the better choice of the 2 or more open options. Different people can give you different responses about your situation. Which can make your problem worse of the option your gonna have decide to pick which advice could outrun the rest. Even picking which choice your gonna make can put more stress and pressure on you. Maybe even after picking your choice it could turn out the worst day of your life or the best. Its really hard to make the selection of which advice your gonna pick.",6,6,6,5,5,6,2732,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"
353,2020,EBF9131A638F,"Distance learning is a new learning method for students to attend classes from home by online or you can video conference. Schools have brought distance learning in their system for students can do their assignments from home. Many people think this is a great idea and some oppose to this learning method. The schools can see if they are on track or online to their classes but if they arnt in the online class they will be behind in their assignments. Is this new learning method a great way to learn? or does being in a class with a teacher more beneficial for the student? The main problem in distance learning is if students are really getting on the online class. Students who do get on are on task and on point. The students who get on the computer and get on the online class for a short period of time at home might be playing, or might not be concentrated, because he is at home and dosent feel like doing it. Students who dont do their assignments they wait until they are at school because in school you arnt distracted like at home you are concentrated and ready to work. Is distance learning beneficial for students at home? for some students it might be but for many it isnt. Is online learning at home beneficial for students? some students do think its beneficial and a really great idea. Many people prefer learning in class with a teacher because they can ask questions if they dont get the question that is being asked. Students do some of their work but get off in a short period of time if they are at home, if they were at school the students would be on task and doing their assignments, unlike at home they would be off task. Many students prefer teachers teaching them so they can get more information of what they are being taught. Distance learning isnt capable of doing what you do in a classroom. Is distance learning really beneficial? Is being taught in a classroom more beneficial for students? many students prefer being taught by a teacher than online. Students are more productive and they share their thoughts and explanations in that specific assignment than online classroom. All the students are in the same page and all gathering more information by writing notes and being concentrated in their tasks. Students are more interactive with each other and sharing thoughts and many techniques to get the answers by fellow classmates, also getting good grades. Classroom learning is beneficial for many students and teachers. Students have their own way of learning, it doesnt matter if its distance learning nor in a classroom. It is how they feel how they enjoy learning. Students will say this is the best way for learning other no this is, it doesnt matter what you think is the best way to learn its how you enjoy learning something it is the best way for you. The students who prefer distance learning really do it at home and feel like they are learning mush more at than in a classroom. Students who enjoy learning in a classroom like being around peers and want knowledge from everyone around them. They are both beneficial for that specific student.

354,232,F06D9612B900,"One activity i consider really enjoyable are science experiments . One of the reasons i consider these activities fun is because they are different from other types of projects . And what i mean by this is that for example when one does a math project or a language arts project is nothing more then doing many math exercises or writing an essay . Unlike the science projects for example one time i got to see a frogs interior . And it might sound desgusting to many of the people reading this and to be honest it didnt smell good either . But one of the things that facinated me from the project it was that frogs dont have as many organs as we humans do . Or maybe they removed some of them but there wasnt a lot of organs in there And another thing i was curious about was that they were different colors . i remember seeing blue and pink unlike us humans almost all of our insides are red . Frogs actually got different colors in their interior but they looked a little dry because my teacher told me that they have been frozen for some time . But it defenently made it easier to cut parts in the interior of the frog . And also sense my teacher told me that we were able to cut whatever we wanted me and my group tried to explore as much as possible . But there was a part that was really desgusting which was that there was some flies in the frogs stomach . And that part definently disgusted me but it didnt made me want to stop either. After we finished trying to see everything inside the frog the teacher told us the name and function of each of the parts of the frog . But one of my friend decided it was silly to poke the frogs eye . And until this point i still dont know what went trough his mind in that exact moment . But wen he poke it , it resulted that the frogs eye wasnt completly frozen so liquid from the eye just came rushing out and he got wet because he decided to do that . Fortunently it didnt reach me but it defenently reach my mate . After that the teacher send him to the bathroom to wash himself . After that happened my teacher decided that it was best to just stop the project after that . But it was defenently a lot of fun . Another example of a project was recently when my tacher decided to have us do a project in the dark because is themed to what we are learning about right now . Which is the unit of light and the project was really simple and to be honest it wasnt as amazing and funny as the other project . But it was to spray a liquid in front a flashlight . And what was supposed to happen was that i would be able to see the waves which light travels on . And after the teacher explained the process of how this happens she told us to spray the liquid in front of the flashlight and being honest i didnt see anything i was kind of dissapointed . But after four seconds i could see them and they were kind off hard to see and it was for some few seconds but i actually enjoyed the project . But it had some downs like it was really short and the teacher took forever to explain the process . But i still think it was a really interesting project . And what i tried to show by showing you this examples from my own personal experiences is that . Science experiments are not always boring and you may not like them but you should give them a chance . And i promise you that you are going to like them or at least one of the many projects there is . Because they make class a little more interesting . And in my opinion projects or experiments are the best activities there is in the school . Beacause they teach you in a more directs type of learning . And thats why i think they are the best .

356,2326,3D4475C949C2,"The idea of schools allowing their students to take classes from home is is an excellent idea. Not all students learn the same way,or at the same pace as everyone else. Having the opportunity to learn in a way that is most comfortable for you, can really show improvements in grades. Students who are sick and are not able to attend school also have an advantage of doing missing work from home. This will give students no excuse for being behind with school work if their able to do classes from home. Students that are often sick, or miss a lot of school because of personal reasons would have an advantage with doing their classes from home. If students have the opportunity to do classes from home they dont have to stress about returning to school, and having a lot of class work to make up. Therefore, students will no longer have an excuse for failing classes because of absences if they have the option to do it from home. When i had my surgery last school year it was nearly impossible for me to catch up on all my missing work, the only way i could do my class work was if someone picked it up from school. Unfortunately my parents both work so while i was out of school i had no way to do it from home. It was very difficult to finish all that work after getting back, because i was not given many options of getting the work done. If i was given the option to complete my class work from online this would have really helped me maintain my grades up. Seniors might be in the position where they need more than the usual amount of classes to graduate by their final year. Having to be in such a difficult position and only being able to attend morning or night school can make it harder to get these classes done on time. This will only make it stressful, and discourage students to get the classes done by the time of graduation. Not only do some seniors have jobs after school but having to attend a full day of school, and either morning or night school can be tiring and overwhelming. Overdoing yourself can also decrease the amount of people that pass their classes because of the reason that they have to much to get done in a matter of one school year,so allowing students to do some classes online will make it easier for more students to graduate. The idea of online classes might sound difficult for some students because they tend to learn better face to face. Schools can offer virtual teaching lessons for those who have an issue with attending all their classes at school and learn better by someone verbally explaining each concept to them. Not all students have computers at home which is understanding, in order for students to complete online classes from home they will need a computer,schools can offer students a borrowed computer or laptop in order for them to participate in online classes. Schools can Introduce a system where they provide for those who need the help of obtaining a computer and to still be able to do their classes from home. By providing for those who need the computers, students will not be held back from the idea of doing classes from home just because they dont own a computer. Having the choice of doing classes from home can be very beneficial to students. This gives students the opportunity to complete more classes and actually do them without having the excuse of being absent to school. Given the chance of doing classes from home can increase the passing levels for more classes. The idea of doing classes from home can be helpful for students who need it, and encourage students who need the option of at home classes to actually get these classes done from home. I think all schools should have an option that allows students to do classes from home. ",9,8,8,8,8,8,789,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 9"
357,2040,AF98232BDB08,"Some schools use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes. Students shouldnt use their cell phones in classroom for educational purposes its going to be big problem with teachers and parents if they are using their phones in class and teachers are going to be conserder about how bad they are going in school their grades are affecting them. I disagree i dont think that they should be allowed to use their cell phones in classroom It distracts them from learning and paying attention in class if they use there phones in class they will not know or learn the important information that the teacher is teaching cause what the teacher teaches is about what you need for your education. One reason is that They dont do their work if they have their cell phones they might be saying that they are getting their work done but they are not doing their work their doing something else on their cell phones. For example instead of them doing their work in class they are really playing games, watching movies listening to music , talking to their friends on the phone texting them they spent all their days in school using their phones doing all these thing that they shouldnt be doing and that wont help them in their education. A second reason why students shouldnt use their cell phones in class is that they arent learning anything in class they dont listening to what the teacher is teaching in class its not helping them learn new things and have knowledge for other things and wont be really for quiz or test. For example when a test is coming up they dont do well on because they havent been listening in class; they were too besy using their phones playing games, watching movies or whatever they were doing on their cell phones so thats why they get bad grade on their test and have bad grades throughout the year then they cant do anything to get their grades up before the quarter ends. Some say that cell phones are useful for school to have them as a resoucre when they need to find information about things their trying to look for. But they are wrong students dont need to be using their cell phone in their classroom at all it just distracts them even more from what they should be doing because if they are going a project for a class they dont need their cell phones with them they can find the information that they need by using other resource to get what they need for their project. For example if they are trying to find how to cook or bake they can go to the libary and look for a books that are about cooking and baking or they can also ask their teachers for help they wont need their cell phones to find their research. When we know that if they have their cell phones with them they wont be doing their work they will be doing other things that arent importante. Thereforce that is why students shouldnt be allow to use their cell phones in class or when they are at school so that they can paytention in their class and learning what the teacher teacheing them everyday in class and like that they dont get bad grades. So student dont need their cell phones at any point in school they shouldnt be allowed for educational purposes they dont need to have them to distract them from learning in school.",5,5,6,5,5,5,2364,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 5"
358,1694,F9BE4676CA35,"""All students must participate in at least one extracurricular activity.""why? well because it helps you a lot in the future or now so the principal is right on letting every student do an extracurricular activity. To me each student actually should participate in one or more activity. Because it helps you mentally and emotionally,and helps you get collage credits and be healthy. Many research has proven many reason why people should do at least one activity to help you benefit in life .Research has proven people who have done sports most likely wont have heart attacks or wont even have breathing problems or mostly any issues. How it helps you benefit in staying fit or healthy or both is well playing a sport can really help you lose weight .help you be more active like for example playing baseball,basketball,track or even being a cheerleader and many other sports can help you a lot more then you think, because research has proven a lot that people who are more active are people who are benefiting from it a lot . Another way it helps you is emotionally is because you get distracted and you dont think about the stuff that is stressing you all the time. you know you have a break from what is keeping you stressed because you are having fun. for example of having a way to distract yourself isnt just sports its working with other like helping out the councilor, helping out in making the yearbook, helping around in the school and not being just about you when your just thinking all about you well that is the problem. Instead of have all the students separated you can put all of the students each in different groups everyday that way people get to know each other and have fun . collage credits also matter and playing a sport or just helping around the school would look amazing on a collage application . Extra activities would make a lot more collages be interested in you and most likely be interested in giving you a scholarship. You mostly get into a great collage because all the extra credit actually helps you get noticed by a lot of collages because they arent just looking for people who have good grades they are looking for people who actually are more outstanding. Like grades are great, but how can you handle being nice . Have certain thing taken care of before anything . well how you take certain things serious because if you cant take your own high school classes seriously how are you going to take care of your classes in collage .Also collages are seeing how independent you are, and how well you do around others . Having all the students do one or more extracurricular activity will benefit them so much of a lot of reasons why actually so you should try it out .Also because it doesnt hurt you to give it a try . I agree fully with the principal because not everything is a lot what you want you have to just go with it .",7,6,7,7,7,6,3758,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Doing oline stuff and video conferencing is a great way for students to stay on task with their work. I think that students would take the benificial of being able to attend to school from home because they have responsibilities and also a future ahead of them.

Second reason on why students should take the benificial of doing school from home is because they might want to have a future ahead of them. When you are in your senior year thats when ou got to step up your game. What if you miss the bus or dont have a ride and you cant get to school then you obviously just video chat with your classes. If you dont understand with your school work you can do learning stuff online so you dont feel behind. Doing online stuff as well help students who dont know what they are doing and feeling left behind. Those are the reasons why students should do video confrences and online stuff because they want to have a future ahead of them. Lastly, some people dont want to take the benificial of having video confrences or oline stuff to do school stuff at home. The reason why they dont want to do that is because when they are home they just want to have free time not to do school work at home. Also when they are sick they dont do anything because they think that they dont have that much work to miss. Well you see when you are home not doing anything then what are you getting done obviously nothing because they think that when they go back to school they wont miss that much work.

362,2061,79D634E4575F,"Some schools of the United States are looking forward to the day that students will attend classes from home by way of online. Dispite this exciment it can be not beneficial for some students in the way of learning. Making students to attend classes online happens will change many students lives. Although some say that offering online classes by the school would be more beneficial, actually it wont be beneficial for students who wants to attend online classes offered by the school because it will require more work for students and students will have less interaction with people face to face. Those who believe schools should offer online classes have reasons. They believe that students will have flexible schudeles during the day. It will help students to relieve strees and to work if they have a part-time job. They also think that students will become more responsable attending classes from home. Doing their work in their own will develop a self- decipline. One of the main reasons why schools of the United States shouldnt offered students to attend classes online from their is because it requires more work from the students. For example, my friend Generic_Name. He is attending one class online from his home. He says that he doesnt have too much time to practice a hobby or do something else because he needs to do a lot of assignments for his online class. Sometimes he has to do two homeworks each day just for one class. Also his class online requires to write a lot, such as essays or read books. Essays and reading books counts as a big percent of his grade. And it doesnt include the warm-ups and classworks during the class. Requiring this ammount of work schools shoulnt offered these classes online because too much work is assigned just for one class. If students want to take other classes they wont have time to do it. Like my friend Generic_Name his life has become very busy since he stated taking this online class offered by his school. In fact, students become very wird because they have less interaction with people face to face. For instance, my counsin Generic_Name she used to be a girl that really liked to interact with people. One day her school offered her some online classes to take. She said yes. Well in a short period of time her parents starting to notice that she was becoming a very shy and wird person when time was passing and continuing taking clases online. Later, her parents found out that her online clases made her become a wird child because of the less interaction she had with people. Schools should privide students a diferent method to help students to attend their classes becuase online classes keep students from the real world and their interaction with people. Avoiding classes online will reduce the percent of students to become wird and shy and to have a better relationship with people. In conclusion, many schools of the United States should stop offering students online classes becuase it requires a lot of work for the students. These classes just make studentss life busier than what they expected. Also, students are afraid to interact with other people face to face because they spend most of time in their computers. The real world need students who like to interact with people not shy students.

Although some might agruenming that graduate in three is bad ideas actually graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own. First reason is graduate three is good idea because be more mature for real world. Many people today they does know how real world work. for example, many teenage does not know how real world work; teen drink and drive involve themselves in accident they hurt themselves and other people without think about their action because their parent bail them out of problem so they dont care if hurt some one are not.

Another example, is parent take teenage their full reasonable like pay for car insurance if brake the law parents stand for them say my child is innocent because parents defends for them if do some wrong convinces themselves they do right thing so be to late for them they think that way real world world work they woundt able to learned from their mistake. This show that teenage graduate three year help them to know their surrounding know full action they take full responsible own act. Second reason is good ideas teenage graduate because it full rsponable of their own they will pay house rent and bills, light bill for example, my mom pay for phone bill so real they care where money come all know is pay for bill. this shows teen will be more rsponable if pay the own bill be care bill not to go up. Another example I use to much light and water so when water and light bill come will go up ; my mom is only one that has pay bill. this shows that if teenage doesnt how much they use water and light bill because their take care of those things for them. Other some side might argument that graduate in three is bad ideas because you miss out life you dont know to have fun you will be stress out you know what make you happy. other example is on enjoy the moment you have as teenage. At the end graduate three is good ideas because be more mature for real world and you are able take full responsible of their own you will know what life lay out you out their.

Then after they change the menu all the student will see all the change and they start to comment about how is the menu, of course it will a percent of students they will be not agree about the food, thats why i recommend the principal will do a session for student to start to vote what kind of food they want in their menu. I recommend these for the principal to listen all the opinion are students said, when the menu change we dont got any issue or complain from student because that will affect the change of the menu because the principal take the decison in him self. However if in case the principal convince about this i will give some examples about my opinion and what i agree to have a new lunch menu i support all my data because i want the school to change the lunch menu. whatever happen about student reaction for the new menu the principal how to know have control in the students because that be a big deal if not be prepared or make a bad decision somehow the principal will prepared to fixed correctly and faster and improve a good resource for all student, but my opinion is to make all this happen because we need the school change and give attention all the opinion of all the students. Finally we are welcome to have a new lunch menu, and we will enjoy the change what our school give to us, and for all.

Where put threw challenges everyday with out even knowing, and get threw them no matter how hard it may be. By helping others it could make not just you seced in life but others as well. Even my family and I have been threw the worse. From living in rooms, basements, and being envicted from apartments because my parents wouldnt make enough money to keep us in one place. They were losing alot of hope with life and from ever being stable for there family, but me as the only boy in the family I had to keep my positive attitude in life for our family goal in reaching stablebility for my older and younger sibling and I. I would wake up on top of some folded blankets the hard wooden floor with my mom and dad aside me but I wouldnt care cause as long as I knew my little siblings were on the bed comfortbly sleeping it would make me feel good because I knew one day it was all going to change. Keeping my positive attitude with my life really helped me alot, because once I turned 16. I started to work at Mcdonalds everday after school from 3:30pm to 10:00pm for five days a week. Everytime I got payed I would save up my checks because I knew my parents never had good cars. We would always buy junky cars off the road, because we could never afford new cars. So I set my self a goal on buying my parents a new car, because I knew it could help them out. By not spending on old cars, I also knew they could never save up from all the stuff they had to pay and such. There were many days at work where I wanted to quit, but I would always look on how my family and I lived. Also on how much my parents struggled just to give us hot food on the table. So I always kept my positive attitude with me for my family. The day came after 1 year of working I had saved up over 10k for a new car for my parents and the family. My mom and my dad where so proud of me and told me they could never thank me enough for all the hard work I had put in everyday at work for the family. Me and my family started to gain hope on our family after they saw what a big change I had made to the family just by having a positive attitude. So my two oldest sisters and I where starting to save up for a home for the family and that too, we had accomplished. Now we have a home that we have been living in for 5 years now, everyone has there room I bought my self a car too. Life is good and I feel super successful with my life already.

367,1554,81D266D94D6D,"Do we get astonished when people behaviors change over time? This makes us surprised and wonder because of their first impressions to us. I disagree that, first impressions are almost impossible to change. People changes all the time just like how the world moves every second. First impressions are possible to change. A behavior is a conduct of oneself in a particular way. A persons character is similar to how a pregnancy grows. When a woman is pregnant, you may be unable to tell but as times goes on, it is definitely going to show. People hide their true and real behaviors to get what they need or want. In todays world, struggles and difficulties are playing a very huge role in modern societies. Needs are the most crucial things in life. Some examples of needs are shelter, clothes and foods. We need all these to survive in life and we are going to lack something necessary, desirable or useful when we have no one to provide all those needs. So a person can act in a good way when you meet them for the first time because they just want to accomplish some goals. Last time, I was watching a Ghanaian movie with my family. In the movie, a man named Mr. Bright was very poor. He couldnt cater for his wife and three daughters so, he decided to deceive every rich or wealthy woman he meets the first time. His first impressions to them was to act and brag as a wealthy man who travels to foreign countries to hoax the women and get some money to cater for his family. You see how poverty makes a person behaves? So first impressions are possible to change because some factors affect humans all the time. Sometimes relationship issues and depressions makes people behaviors change. Marriage is a union between two people in which no one can separate that. No one gets married to his or her nemesis so bad pressures from our partners affect our characters. Depression makes people sad, causes difficulty in thinking and concentrating. Two years ago, I met a girl called Generic_Name. She was so isolated and sad. I decide to ask what was going on. Immediately I began to talk, she shouted as if I was a monster but later on I realized she was being bullied by some guys in our school. So the counselors helped her out and we became very close friends. I realized she was very respectful, kind and good. So how we see people for the first time doesnt mean that is how they are. People change all the time. Peer pressures and bad friends make people characters change to a different level. You will meet a person who was respectful for the first time but later on, you will find the same person talking back and arguing with their teachers in a very bad way. Bad friends are the worst thing in life. They can affect your future and perspectives. A girl who was very shy to talk in my class became the most disrespectful student in our class all because she joined some five bad girls in our school and after that, she decide to live the life she wants which was very bad. Our teachers know the road to success so they have to be respected and treated in a very nice way. No teacher wants his or her students to fail and every teacher wants to be awarded by the good efforts of their students. First impressions are possible to change all the time. ""Every coin has two faces"" so, we must deal with people in a very pleasant, patience and respectful way. A person may be good at the first time but changes later whiles a person may be bad at the first time but changes later because some factors like needs, depressions and poverty are affecting them. How a person behaves the first time you meet them may change all the time. And if we understands how the world is moving every seconds we all going to get peace!

Your talent can be playing an instrument, singing, or dancing. A skill can be building things, sports, and cooking. The talent I have is playing a Guitar because it took time, practice, and studying. When you want to do something big it can take a lot of time. Time is what we all need and time can go fast or slow, but thats good because it can really be helpful. Playing the Guitar took a while but it payed off, mostly because I used my free time to play. Sometimes I can get stress playing mainly by not having much time playing before a concert. It could be hard doing it ,but by doing so I can see my self getting better each day. Practicing could get hard, but if your relax and not think too much youll see it will be easy. Practicing can make you accomplish anything youve been doing a long time. Doing the Guitar was hard but not too hard because Ive been practicing for a while. Playing some of the songs were fast and long, but when I got home Id play the song over and over until I got it just right. Thats how I know by practicing is really helpful and made me be good at doing the I wanted to do the most in life. Some people dont like to study and its not something we have to do, but something we need to do. I think studying is more of a thing you want to do if you care so much about what your doing. Studying the notes was one of the first things I had to do before playing the Guitar and the songs. By studying I can see the notes were not that easy to play and also tuning the Guitar, but thats why I studied to see what I was doing wrong. Studying is what I did to be fantastic at the Guitar also being amazing at the concerts. In conclusion, If you want to be awesome at what your doing you need to use your time wisely, practice, and study. By doing all that youll see that you will be amazed at what you did. Maybe you can even be famous for what you did by focusing on your goal.

372,1813,F2B390040C12,"My school should follow this model by extending the school day two hours, and four day school week. There are some benefits but also disadvantages. First reason, if we take only two hours of class during the day probable should more express try the best of us, for use that time of class. In contrast, lose hours in others things not necessary; with more hours and days off the students would be distract of the responsability that is demanding the school. second reason, less pressure for the students that have a job is a big idea taking the school day two hours, because they want time for both during the week. For example, i work 27 hours in three day i came home so late, hungry, and tired sometimes i miss days of school, for that reason i think is benefit take time on sleep then came to the school just for few hours. But, one disadvantages that could be happent is less time of classes when the students dont work or spend time in others distraction. Clearly, they feel more in liberty in do something else on free time, and would not put all in the study. Third reason, another disadvantages is not focus at all maybe should not work that idea; in the way that lost time of school is lost sacred time. The teachers miss day of their job too, and the student do not see the loss of the oportunity that is the school. However, one benefit and important for the students is the repose, so when our brain is in repose with not too much pressure it was relax, and we going to be blessed. Because, we have more time to think much better what we want to do for our future,so we think most clear. In conclusion, in my opinion it is a great idea if my school take a four day school week of two hours each day.

The first time you wont get it so easily like you thought you would, but though lots of practice you will get it right in no time and better at it to.

Having to take a class that is based on art or drama and not being good or intrested in it must be a little fustrating to a studnet.

As a studnet myself i amdit that losing focuse in class when not being intrested came very easy to me.

Having more then enough credits helps the student one graduate early and two have credits even before starting college.

Also its good for you and your grade so it is a win win. Most of the time people have good time with their projects and enjoy doing them to score better in their grade.

Music is A lot of fun when you are doing it with A friend or a teacher. I think project can be a great way to show creativity.

Depending on the way people are raised they may change their behavior over time. If you are brave enough you can choose who you want to be, and you can guide yourself. Everyone is going trough something at this moment, and these are not always good things. People may experiment terrible incidents that are going to change their life forever. These events are just going trough your life, and sometimes there is nothing you can do to make it different. All these things may change you character behavior. Anyones personality is going to change if they are not aware of what they are doing, and these actions will lead you to live horrible moments. At this point you no longer have control over your actions and just doing what you want, maybe not knowing what your character has turned into. On the other hand; will realize what is going on around their live as they grow up, and they are not afraid to know what is happening, they will use this problems to become stronger. As time passes; they will go trough different issues, experiment different changes, but they just dont pay attention to it, and do what they want. Those people usually have control over their life and decide whether they want to change or not. A lot of people around them will try to hurt make them feel different. For some people is easy to just not care about anything and just care about themselves, it could be a good thing because not anyone is going to make you feel bad. Over time they become smarter, stronger and tougher, but they also know if they need to change something in their life. They were just raised in a different way and a different place that is why they will act different to the rest of people because they also know what is best for them, when something bad is happening they know how to handle it. These situations may change anybodies personality and eventually they will become a complete new different person. it just depends on the actions they choose to do and the way they see the world. it could be because of tragedies, maybe many bad people around them, they could change if they wanted to. There is many possibilities and reasons for people to change and it will happen at any given point and when they realize it, they are completely different. It just depends on the way of your thinking, only you can decide if you want to be different, some people may have a weak or strong mind. Some situations are just defined as drastic events that could happen to you and there is nothing you can do about it if you wanted to make it better, only you know if you can handle it. You can confront it or let it change you. Some people will form their own character, or because they dont know what to do anymore.

When you first meet someone you automatically get an impression of that person from the way they dress, or the way they speak basically the way they do things. Now a days people jump into conclusions, they never met the person, they just go off upon looks. For example say a teenager is wearing all black with ripped jeans and they got their pants down low, adults are going to think that teen is possible a gangster or a thug but thats not the case, thats just the style now a days. First impression can change overtime, once you get used to something your mindset changes, say you meet a friend and you guys start talking and your friends starts giving you an attitude, your going to assume that your friend doesnt like you so you keep that mindset. Yall start talking again and this time its going way better, you and your friend are laughing, overall just having a good time now your opinion has changed towards the person. there was this guy he started to stare at me every few seconds so i thought he had a problem or something but he looked familiar but i couldnt figure out where ive seen him from, later that day he ended up being in my last block class, the teacher made the class work in pairs so i got up and asked the guy if he wanted to be my partner, he said sure and we began working, we started talking about random things until he said ""you look familar"" then he said didnt we go to the same middle school together, then it clicked I was friends with this guy back in middle school and havent seen him in a long time, after that day we began talking almost everyday.

383,214,45291197F292,"I agree I think its a good idea for the students to start a specific career young,because you can be getting early experience to working in a certain field that their future career my require. Its good to choose a career now instead of later because reaching early adulthood with no planned career in mind, because you may have a certain job that you may not like since you didnt plan ahead for your dream career and you be stuck with a 9-5 job. With things like finishing high school and not going into college to further your education for that dream job you want will make your chances of getting the job you want scarce or even impossible. 2. What makes It worse Is, not having the diploma required for that certain job which means you could end up in community college again re-taking class for your job you didnt decide to choose while in high school. 3. And another thing Ive seen Is having one career not work out and a person ends up not having a backup plan for their second career. adding to that some of these careers require years of school some specific schools like law school or going to a school for doctors. I dont agree with choosing a career early in high school, because most high school students dont know what they want to be or they dont have a career in mind at the moment. Students should not be required to take a career path so early, when they have yet to experience their first job or paycheck. and not having any interest in the job offers that are shown to them on the application. Most students are young, and requiring them to have a career plan will end up having them feel like they will be rushed, into doing things like going to career interest fairs choosing what hes interested in and why and talking about with others and what things he or she will need to do. 2. Some high schools care about future jobs they want while most dont so most will not care about their future career and just choose a random career to get started on because they dont know what they like. 3. Some high school students genuinely do not care about school or their own career, so they just drop out mainly because they dont like high school and want to do other ""things"" outside of school adding to that there could be a stress level that is being put on high school kids thinking about the future instead of enjoying the present. so in conclusion students should have their own decision on weather they want to have a career plan now or later.",4,5,7,6,5,5,902,"conventions 5, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 4"

386,3901,BD8683F93B5A,"Dear Generic_Name I understand that you are considering the benefits of working with a group or working alone. This could be a big deal depending the class because the majority of students prefer to work alone, we should use some of the time that we have in class to vote and see what students want, but i agree with the idea of working with a group for two reasons: we can devide the work and you get to talk to other students while their working. First reason is that it feels like we do get the enough time to work, when we get to work with groups everything gets a lil bit more easy because there is less work to do, and if they decide to work alone, you would notice that they are going to have more problems completing the assignment, while the other studens that are working in group they would find this assignment more easy, so the way the teacher dont have to spend to much time with only one student. Second reason is that they should not have problems finding the information because while some of them are writing the other students should it be serching for anwsers, for example, students that are working alone they would find this a lil bit harder because they have to do the writing and searching part by them self. The best part of working with a group is that the work can be finished a lot faster and they can have more time to recheck the work and make sure that you are not missing anything in blank. Also, there is a lot of benefits of working with a group or working alone, but its clear that those students are not going to work with other students because they say that they dont like to be talking to other students, that they prefer to work alone, but anyways the teacher should be agree with this, thats how she would know if you need more help with the assignment then other students. I strongly believe that working with a group could be the best choice for students because they are not going to spend to much time doing the assignments, so you could work with someone and devide the work wich positively affects, therefore, we must try it and see what benefits can we get from this and voting could be a good idea to decide if students would like to work in group.

BIGININ:Well in certain states school barely have extra help for students for Example in El Salvador, Nicaragua, Honduras and more states but in the united states is different they have extra programs the main thing is us the students they want a good education in my Generic_School we have an after school its call Hornet 21 and in my opinion i think that having a program like that is awesome why you might be asking well here are some few reasons 1st of all you get to see on what the students need help 2nd of all you get to ask them on what they get stuck or dont understand. 3rd of all you get to meet your teacher and they get to meet you. there some students that are to shy to talk about it this will also help the teachers on where or what group they should them to work on what do they need work on? witch would be very helpful them and there teachers and the teachers might notices some changes or not. not every mistake can be change but you can start fresh again. FIRST: it would also be helpful to see on what subject there really good and they are confident about it those teachers who help on everything like they know everything they move from one to another class room they could help those kind of students that get homework from different subjects for example like Math,Scients, Social studies. and the teachers could inform the students teacher on what there struggling and on what there all good on I mean you never know if those students could be are next president or are next doctor, police. this program is also nice because it helps students practice English not for all of them but for some of them yes this help me a lot. MIDDLE: this program will also make the student proud of them self a little thing can change our world to be come better our country need programs like this programs that are going to success us programs that were going to be proud of this kind of programs have help a lot of students i know sens elementary school and not should middle school have it high school and elementary to and is also nice because some parents come late to work and the program would be finishing about 4:50 so there going to be fine when they get home so they can be home alone this after school activity would also get them prepare for there exams they could study and they would easy get an A or a B. END You could also do this to a student who doesnt want to do there work or nothing you can make them stay in after school and they can finish what they decided to not do and that might be a big lesson for them to learn you could also tell some of the students to spread the word to some of there friends so you could get more students everyday and if they stay Monday,Tuesday, Wednesday on Thursday and Friday they could have a free day you could have them do soccer basketball anything they want if they deserved it, you could also announced one day so the whole school would know about the program this could also be fun for the teachers not just for the students teachers to well thats what i think on a after school homework club. Base on this information I can say that schools do need this program Because its really helpful for the students. outside in the worlds there some kids who dont even know what school is because there working to feed there family. The community should do more programs like this so students get extra help. not all the county gets to have fun activities like us. and my opinion is yes its good to have after school programs for schools and kids who care and that have a featured.",5,4,6,6,4,4,1198,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

I agree that people should make their own decisions because they should have freedom to make their own choices. They should think for them self. Having the freedom to make their own choices is important because if they can have the freedom to choose what they want the experts are going to choose something that they dont like, or want. For example, the person wants to buy some fancy shoes but the authorities dont like those shoes they are going to say no and decide to buy other shoes. In my thinking I would not like to someone choose for me because they dont know what I like, or what I dont like. If they let other people make there choices they are not going to be happy because the expert or the authorities are going to choose what they like not what the people want. For example, they go to the lunch room and there is a lot of food there and they are trying to get something but they dont let them get what they want because they dont have the freedom to make there own choice, so the authorities are going to come and choose the food for them. Another reason is that the person can think for them self. If the persons cant think for them self they are going to have a lot of problems in there life because if the expert, or the authorities comes and ask the persons something and they cant think, the experts are going to think for the persons and make choose something that the persons will not like. In conclusion, having the right, or the freedom to make the decisions for them self is a good think because everyone wants to make their own decisions they dont want no one to be telling them what to do, or what to think.

Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because students would pay more attention to their phones than their teachers. Some teachers would rather take their students to the library or to a computer lab to use the computers to do assignments, instead of letting them use their phones because students would not get their work done. For example in my school we used to have the school WIFI on our phones but that only made us get distracted so my school decided to take down the WIFI from our phones, this year we were given chromebooks so we can do our class works in class without having to go to the library or a computer lab. We can take our chromebooks in any class to do our assignments and its made a huge impact on every student because now no one is ever on their phones, and we pay more attention to our teachers. By letting students use their cell phones during class will increase the chances for them to get distracted, for example one day my english teacher gave us a reaserch paper and told us that we could use our cell phones to search up important documents, while we were doing our work one of my classmates phone went off because she got a snapchat notification and everyone got distracted, the next day everyone was using their phones in class and no one was doing the work that we were assigned to do. Students should not be aloud to use their phones during class because it will not benefit them, this would be a distraction to not only students but teachers as well. If schools let students use their phones there also will be a higher chance that students grades will drop, and a lot of parents would not be pleased. My parents would get extremely mad if my school let us use our cell phones during class because they know I would easily get distracted, if we were aloud to use our phones the whole school would be a disaster. Teachers would not be happy with the idea of letting students use their phones, because every teacher wants the whole class attention on them not their cellular devices. Some students and schools might think that letting students use their phones would be a great idea because it could probably benefit those students who might not have a computer at home, and maybe letting them use their cell phones during class to do their assigments would help them, but that doesnt mean that every student has to use their phones too. Schools should not let students use their phones for educational purposes because it would be a big distraction for students and teachers.

Consequently many end up loosing their self in the worse way and they take paths that guides them into substances that had damage the rest of the society, like drugs or the alcohol. Furthermore, parents lets teachers decide what to do with their child because they think schools will teach them the right way to learn about how life works and that includes self-esteem. Although some people say praising students deficient work helps build self-esteem because it bring hope for them, actually praising deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards because students will not improve their work and it is unfair for the hard working students. According a survey found in Google, many students quite school at a young age because they disbelieve how good they are at schooling. Furthermore, the survey display a chart where a big number of those who quite schools are the greatest students and according to the writer they do not have enough knowledge about it. Praising them probably wont help them learn fast and smarter but it does not let them give up easily she wrote in a quote. However, students that are praise for their deficient work never improve. For example Generic_Name, my friends brother he quite schools since for years because he says that nothing he learns at school apply in personal life. Even though his teachers did everything they could to help him improve his grades, additionally they praise his worst work and it did not even work. Moreover, The New York Times post an article about students failure and they conclude that students that have a job and study at the same time, they are more likely to finish high school. In the other hand students that gets money from their parents, most of the time they do not finish high school and if they the do, they do it with the lowest grades ever. In addition, praising students deficient work undermines learning by lowering standards. According to the Generic_School, two of three students in a class graduate, but those who graduate are the ones that work hard and study for long hours to achieve their goals. Clearly, praising students deficient work shows that schools are becoming worst more than in the past years and students now are not competent to apply for a simple job. For that reason, many parents believe that deficient work lowers learning standards and that schools are getting worse and weaker every year. In conclusion, self-esteem comes from the students best effort, by working hard and not being unfair with the others. As we know Steve Job achieve his dreams by hard work and not by the praise of the society or even his parents. Because of his great achievements, Apple is still one of the greatest companies ever created. Definitely, those kind of examples teach and stress the importance of building self-esteem by hard work. Every people have different thoughts about how a student should be teach but whatever they choose will influence their childrens life forever.",7,7,7,6,7,6,1866,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Some peple believe that choose a career at a young age can be beneficial for the students while other people believe choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big responsibility, you do not have enough time to think about new options, over the time students gets new skills and you have to be sure about what you really want. This is important because it is not easy for students have expecifics aspirations and good options of careers at a young age. First, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you have to be sure about what you really want, you have to inform you about others posibilities, you need to know what are the benefits that some careers offer to you. For example, some schools offer to you a tutor and they help you to decided based on your interests and they recommended have differents options and spend a lot of time thinking about what is more covinient for you. Secondly, choose a career at a young age is stressful and a big resposibility because you do not have enough time to think about new options.

396,899,E545B850725F,"Although some say extracurricular activities are to enrich educational experiences many say otherwise. Students should definitely be involved in after school activities, whether if its a sport or club, students will enjoy their time. Extracurricular activities could help a student get into collage. The student should be allowed to be apart of as many after school activities as they choose, they should first discusses with their families. The schools should not have the decision if students are in a activity or not based of if they will have time to do homework or study they should let the student make the decision and heres why. The students should be allowed to be in as many activities as possible, while managing their time. The student will have to add the activity to their schedule, and know they will now be doing this on a daily basses or if not multiple times a week. The students family will be able to help the student out when in need of it. There will be time for homework and studying, because with a well put together schedule the student will go to school their choice of activity and go home and do their work. The student and their family should be in control of the management of school work and activities the school shouldnt be involved. When you know something works for you do not let anyone get in between what works for and what doesnt work. Students will have many opportunities in high school the extracurricular activities will just bring more and this is how. Opportunities come and go in high school, but when a student is in a after school activity they will lots of opportunities. Collage could be one of those opportunities, collages like to see a student that is or was apart of a club or sport team. Athletes can get full ride scholarships to collage, when they can manage to do their school work and the activities it could help them in the future. A student managing their time can be difficult but with a well put together schedule can help them get to where they want to be. This is why schools shouldnt control student involvement in extracurricular activities but many have their opinions against this one. Other say that the schools should have control over students and what activities the can do and however many they can do. The school wants the student to be able to have time to study and do homework but by doing that they will take away from the extracurricular activities students are in or want to be in. They say the school should have the power to be able to do this, the student and their families will not really have a say in the final decision. They say the school knows what is right for the student in making the decision on if they should be apart of a after school activity. The school wants the students to be able to do school work outside of school so they will want to take away from a club or sport so a student can have time to do the work. The extracurricular activities should be in control of the students and their family, the school should not limit the amount of activities a student can do. The student should be in control in what they want to do if its a cub or sport, they will have to make time to put this in their schedule and still have time to study and do homework. Doing this can help a student reach goals and they can enjoy their time while doing it. This is why the student should be in control of the activities they do.

397,1913,03CC97D3747E,"Many schools have partner ships with companies that can allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and shadowing opportunities to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of employment. In my opinion its a good idea to allow students to explore certain occupations through internships and to discover whether they are interested or not. By allowing them to visit and explore, they are most likely to know what they want in life and in their upcoming future, and they can get a good job that pays money in the future. The first reason as to why it is a good idea to explore certain occupations through internships is because, students will most likely know what they really want to do in life and it will help them start a good future. I have a cousin named Generic_Name, he has three kids named Generic_Name, Generic_Name, and Generic_Name. Believe it or not Generic_Name was chosen to go to Liberty University a few years ago. He went to the College to see if anything they taught was interesting. A few months later, Generic_Name started going to Liberty for a few years and finished off with straight As. Today he owns his own business, and he is happy as ever. The second reason why it is good to explore certain occupations through internships is because, you are willing to get a good job that pays very well. I have another cousin named Generic_Name, He is the strongest and most bravest person I have ever met. Generic_Name is the AirForce, he joined the air force a few years ago. He loved it there although he said it was somewhat rough. He went to the AirForce because his parents didnt have enough money for him to go to college. After leaving the AirForce he chose to go to Liberty University as well, He absolutely loved it there. He graduated in 2015. He is now working for the FBI and I could not be any prouder of him then I am right now. A few weeks ago I went over to his house and he said ""Generic_Name when i was in the AirForce it was rough for me, I felt like it was useless. Now i know that god put me in that position, because he wanted something big for me. I feel like im on top of the world I have never felt any better then I do today. I also have so much money too, thanks to the job i have they pay really well. One of these days I want to buy a mansion."" I saw tears coming out of his eyes ,and I felt so proud, I said to myself, ""I want to feel like im on top of the world, I want something big for me."" Many students may say that they dont care about college which is somewhat understandable. I was with a friend one day and I was telling her about how I want to go to college so bad, but she didnt seem to care. She looked me in the eyes and said, ""Whats the point of college anyways, its just like going back to hell. My parents never went and there fine."" They also say that going to college is the worst thing ever. My friend once said, ""Why do schools even give the opportunity to students to figure out where they want to go, we dont need college and we dont need a future either. I Actually like working at Wendys."" After my friends said those nasty things about college it just made me want to work harder in life and get better grades in school. In conclusion, exploring certain occupations through internships is not that bad of an idea, its a brilliant idea. As i once said, Im most likely to know what i want in the future, and I will get a good job that pays well. My cousins really have inspired me, because of them and their story, I want to be better and I want to work harder. Maybe later in life I will be working for the government and I will make my future kids happy.",8,9,9,9,9,8,45,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
398,1043,AC692F322516,"I personally disagree using cell phones in classroom, because students will not get the education they need. Students can go on other pages without teachers knowing like looking up something that they are not suppose to. It also can distract others focusing on their work, or studying for a test. It may cause an issue for teachers for allowing students using their cell phones in the classroom. Students using their cell phones can lose focus on the work that is given. Cell phones can cause problems in the classrooms; while students are doing their own work and can not use a cellular device, while taking a test. Using any cellular device while doing any work or taking a test can get into problems by the teacher and it counts as cheating. Students can also lose their cell phones during class or losing it while going to the restroom. Students can get in trouble by other teachers using it in their classroom, can get in trouble for using it while walking, or hitting someone by accident or making someone fall. Students do not see where they are going to doing around them. Using cellular devices will not help students learn the materials that is given. Students can get distracted on the work that is given to them and not attend to do it. Students need the education that the teachers has provided for them. So, students need to stay focus on the work and stay on task on the class work, students can genially have their cellular device off ,so is does not keep them from learning. Using cellular device can effects students thinking on a subject in class. Teachers may not know what students are doing, on their cellular device in the classroom. It can cause problems for students if they are not using their cellular device properly in class. Teachers do not know if students are saying inappropriate comments to others students. Students can also send inappropriate images among other students. Although, using the cellular device is not the best device for doing work or studying on a subject, that they have to do. Provided the knowledge that is given to students and stay on task when is need that way, it helps you not to get lost, but it also can provide students to learn and not to use their phones. More students lose track on time and whats around them. Using cellular devices can stop you from not doing the job quicker. It can slow the work and lesson that is given to them.

399,2268,2B9C5C3BB7B9,"Studies have shown that there is a 25% higher passing rate from students that attend to online classes. If it wasnt for the advance tecnology the world has today there wouldnt be things like online schools. Now and days everyone has tecnology ether in their pockets due to there cell phones or at home with their laptops , computers , gaming systems and their smart tvs. Now with this new technology the school systems have taken advantage by making online classes, Therefore students are able to attend classes form the comfort of there own home. Some schools are given the students the option to choose between online classes or going to normal school classes. Some would say that online classes would not benefit students id say they are wrong. These are some reasons i think that online classes are better and benefits way more than normal school classes, because there are no distractions in online classes. In online classes students dont have to deal with things like waking up early, people , and much more. I had a cousin that took online classes and what i saw she was able to start when she was free shed finish in two hours or less, Then the program would let her know when shed finish the leason of the day. She was a teen mom and when she found out how easy taken online classes were she got support from the family as she finished with the help of online classes and her family she got her life together. The people that say that online classes arent beneficail might not have gone through what 80% of people have gone through. Here an example in regular school classes there are distractions everywhere like friends, other class mates, teachers, aslo the fear of getting bullied. When someone has friends in class they much rather talk to them then to pay attenion in class. When in class you might no peolpe and it may get into your head which would give you another distracion. Now with a student that is in online classes wont have to worry about those issuses. Even the simple things could affect your ability to be able to learn like what you eat. If you dont eat anything during the day you get hungry and that becomes a distracion. In most schools they serve horrible food with that students feel sick after eating. now a benefit with having classes online people can make food at home. After an heathly and amazing lunch they are ready to learn and too pay attention. Not only is things like food vary inportant but time is another one. Due to bad habbits people go to sleep late and then they have two hours of sleep and going to school. Once class starts they fall asleep and dont learn anything. Since schools start early makes it wrose for the ones who go to sleep late at night. The lack of sleep affects the student mentally and physically, With a student that is in the online class can start when ever there free. Last but not least what most of the students fear the most is bullying. In normal schools studies have shown that 80% of students have been bullied. That would mean if there were a table of ten students 8 out of those 10 students where bullied. Many people fear of getting bullied since what it was done to many students through out the years. What it dose is it makes school not feel safe for them and then they want to stop going. Now with online classes students shall not fear in getting bullied since they would take there classes in there house. In conclusion i believe that online classes are the best and have the most benefits due to all the examples ive given. From lunch, time, distrctions and bullies those are the reasons students have a hard time to focuse in regular school classes. A huge thanks to the new tecnology for being able to help us learn without the struggle and fear. What i saw my cousin go though i can say online is the best piont blank. Ive given all tmy examples and details also personal storys on the benefits of online school that is all i have to offer fairwell.",7,6,6,7,6,6,573,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

401,1884,CE19B516A167,"should the school board add one and a half hour to school each day? The school board should add one and a half hours to school each day. I agree with the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school because it would effect the students learning and help them get more smarter and it would effect the school workers because they money they get payed will increase. 1 first of all the school board plane to add one and a half hour to school each day. if the school board add one and half hour to school if will effect the student because they will be able to have more time to study with they teacher which help them gain more learning. for an example when Generic_Name was 10years old in Generic_City, he use to not like school because he had school from 7am to 4pm and the teachers use to force them to do homework,classwork and all the learning he needed it felt like being a maid having someone telling him to do this and that he hated the teacher but he learned a lot from them and him and his classmate still cared they teachers teaching everywhere they went and its very helpful, for an example they teachers was like your parents telling you to do something you dont wanna do they know is good for you but still you dont wanna do it so they force you to do it then you get mad over them for doing that which they find it helpful for you later in life in fact you hate them at that moment for what they did, but after years when your adult you get struggle about something and you remember what she thought you and you find it helpful the how our teachers was like back then in Generic_City, the more hours we had the more smarter we got . This evidence shows that the more time we got learning with our teachers the more smarter we got. clearly sometimes the teachers rush teaching when they do not have enough time and that does not help the student so the more time the teachers get to teach the more student understand the subject well without rushing through the subject. 2 I agree with the school adding one hour and a half to school each day. perhaps if they do add one hour and a half to school each day it really help the student and teachers because they will have enough time learning not rush through learning. for an example when i was in school back then in Generic_City, Generic_Name was in classes doing his work but the classes hours was short so this time when he did not have enough time to do the classwork in class the class hours was like 1hour and 30minites in math class the teacher told us to turn your work in its time to go innocent didnt have enough time so he try to rush through it so he can get it done. after weeks innocent got 60% on my classwork he was disappointed in himself innocent wished he had more time to finish it was not the teachers fault so he didnt blame the teacher because they did they best to make sure we had enough time. if we had enough time it would had really helped us all students and teachers. in addition for students to have better grade they need more time to focus and do they work in class. clearly if school board add one hour and a half to school it will effect students grade because they will have enough time to do they work in class and not rush. In conclusion the school board should add one hour and a half because it will effect student learning and it will also effect they grades too so it will be a good thing to add one hour and half to school each day sometimes the student dont have enough time to do they work and they need sometime to finish but they cant and that effect the decrease the student grades. like in the story when the boy name Generic_Name in his school they didnt have enough time to do they classwork so he rushed through it and got bad grade, so if students have enough time to do they work in class it would be very helpful to the students. if the school board add one hour and half the students grade will be different all they need is just more time to do they work in class and not rush through they work the more time they get to do they work the better they grades will get and the smarter they become.

402,1269,E36B406AFE70,"Although it may seem like being active helps us accomplish more is better, but its actually true that inactivity also serves a purpose to. Three reasons why I think being inactive is that I have time to rest, I can catch up on any t. v shows, or I can hire a butler to do the cleaning around my house. Some people are always being active and have no rest: thats not good because the human body is not used to so much work being done. I think in a certain point of life inactivity will serve a purpose because people will be tired of all the work hey done and will just want to rest. While being inactive there will be time where you can rest. Last year when I worked, I was so tired of the job I had received because I was hot and thirsty out in the sun all day picking up trash. Then one day when I was off, I spent my whole day resting. This served me a purpose because I was able to rest and get my energy back up to work another time. When I was resting I slept up to about 10 hours because I was very exhausted, and gloomy. While I was resting in bed I had time to catch up on bills and any other things that have to do like call in an order for some groceries. Resting this day helped me catch up on everything I needed On weekends, when im at home and im lazy some times I call a butler to come to my house and clean everything. There is a show named Jessie, and on this show they have a personal butler named Bertrum, and he travels with them also: he cleans up for them, cooks food, and he even has to open doors for them. This helps them because while they are trying to rest he is doing mostly everything they need to do. In my opinion, I think hes doing too much work than he is supposed to because it can be overwhelming. Jessie and her kids are very lazy because they basically make Bertrum do everything; that serves a purpose but then not because Bertrum will be exhausted all time. When resting at home I have a chance to catch up on t. v shows that I like: like Master Chef, Wild n Out, and also Real House Wives of Atlanta. No one can tell me to not watch it because I am going to be inactive and have a peaceful day where I have time to myself. The reason why I want to catch up on t. v shows is because, most of the time I dont have time because of work, or ill be caught in a family emergency. Overall, some people might think doing something will make you accomplish something isnt always true. In the world today there are a plenty full of people who are inactive, they sit there and do nothing but have business calls on the phone. I think it would be better for us to work at home and be idle thank to go to work and be very tired. Though some people may not agree with me its better to live that way so you can preserve your energy. Determine never to be idle doesnt always make me accomplishing something; putting my mindset towards that goal helps me reach that goal even if im idle.",8,7,8,8,9,7,3275,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

So you can not change it because that is what you felt at the moment when you experienced this feeling in your life and you will not want to change it because you liked what you felt and you might probably want to repeat it again.

You would think properly with correct knowledge, just by doing that, You would accomplish so many things in life without people going agents you. NOT being you or being someone you really not are, is not a good idea. Dont let them control you: letting people control who you are, isnt a good thing. Many people think is a good thing because they can fame or attention, Its like having a double life, 1: living the regular life, being who you really are, 2: Being out in public pretending to be someone when your not. You wont accomplish the things you want to do when your not yourself. You will feel important when the world wants you be someone. Be yourself and accomplish the things you want to do and you will improve your skills and achivments. They will just control your life and they wont help you on the long run. No one can control someones life who they want them to be. being us, not them: We need let people do what they want we shouldnt be controlling their life. Everyone should chose there who they want to be and what to do. Not everyone should be controlling them. Not everyone are they same, they are different from others. They dont know their weaknesses to be telling them to be. We shouldnt be controlling other people what to become. Many people do it for the fame and attention but they are the most unsuscceful people. They dont achieve things they go by there fame and people. We should be us and not be someone we cant be.

I have completed quite a few goals in my life because it was all i would put my focus to. With certain things it takes one of another to be with you through it to help you, Because it would depend on what you need to have done. Ive helped lots of people get through on what they needed and sometimes its more of what has to be done. People always need to help themselves because it would make them better in their life in my opinion. Its good to see people doing well because of the achievements they have decided to complete. lots of amazing opportunities like you could get a good job, A new car, House or just anything that you would want in general. The small things in life could be just done on its own without you or anyone having to do something about it. So overall many achievements would be done if you are always working hard for it and could be better if you do more than what youre suppose to do. Its great to help yourself in life because you dont know how good it would turn out in the end.

408,3773,DC77E1C50756,"My prompt is about how everyone has a skill or talent and I have to identify a talent or skill that I have and explain how I develop and use it. Well Im an Athletic girl. I play different sports during some seasons, for example when soccer season has ended. Another sport Im kinda good at is basketball. I play sports in school and outside of school. A few other things I can do is sing and dance. Im going to start with soccer. So I started playing soccer in 2018. I dont really remember my age but I do remember the year. When I started playing soccer was when I lived in Generic_City. I played there for to seasons. I played in the spring and fall seasons. When I played in the spring it was the best thing ever like Im telling you I literally fell in love with soccer at that time. My team was a good team we were called the sharks. I was number 14 and I was happy because thats the number that both of my cousins jersey numbers are. Anyways, we won a few games and lost a few ones but we always played good, we gave our best, and we gave it all. After, spring season ended I played on the fall season. Im going to say that fall season was okay it wasnt as good as spring season but I still enjoyed it. My jersey number changed in that season so then I was number 16. I havent played since 2019 ended but I will start playing again pretty soon and Im really happy and excited. Now Im going to talk about my basketball season. Last year in 7th grade I was in Generic_School and they put up the girls basketball season was coming. I was interested in it so I decided to sign up and try-out for the team. I cant lie try-outs were rough but at the end of the day I gave my best and it was fun. A few weeks later they put up the paper of the people who made it and I saw my name and I was so happy. Anyways, that season ended, then school ended, and I moved to Generic_City. School started a few months later girls basketball season started. I was happy so I sign up. I went to try-outs for the whole week. At the end of Friday which was the last day of try-outs the coach Generic_Name told the girls who made the team and who didnt and guess who made the team MEE!!!!. I was so happy my friends and I celebrated on the way out. The whole season was great, I made so many fun memories with the girls and I was just so happy. My third skill is dancing. I love to dance everyday. Like Im always dancing in the car, shower, kitchen, my room, just everywhere. I love it and I enjoy it very much. Its something that could never leave me. Im going to start taking dancing classes so Im very excited for that. One app that I always use to dance is Dubsmash it has different song that I can dance to. Im always dancing to a song in the car when a song comes up and it has beats I just be going crazy. Finally, the last thing I love to do is sing. Singing for me is just very enjoyable and calming. I sometimes get on my feelings and cry but its just because they are really good songs and I cry because Im happy or sad. I love to sing the songs of Sydney R. But my top favorite songs to sing are All of Me, Into you, Love dont Change, and How you gonna. And yeah these are all the stuff that I do as a skill or talent.

Generic_Name woke up every day early in the morning and he went at the college, after he took a bus for his job. After all his effort, after all the nights that he could not sleep, he became in a lawyer but Generic_Name never imagine that the real challenge is coming. After two years of his graduation he found a job ,he bought a house and a car and that is all Generic_Name did for the rest of his life. Should we aspire just at one thing? In every single aspect of our life we have aspiration, to be more every day to get the most beautiful house, the better job but that is all when we get all the we want and the set we stop there. In my opinion,if we dont try to do something beyond what we have already mastered,well never grow because well never have the enough experience and a better quality of life. First,well never the enough experience because we always being in the same situation, every experience that we have make our knowledge,the way that we see the life and the problems. If we never give up to do something beyond our spirit preserve young while we have more experience well have more opportunities nos just in a professional aspect . For example,if we go to college and we finish the career but we stop there for the simple reason it is more safe so we never grow because that make us to be stagnate in one place,we think that doesnt matter that we good. Second,Well have a better quality of life because when we try to do the best every day,when we kept learning we became in a successful person which is good point because you inspire at others. well have all the thing that one day we wanted an the most important thing well have the power to help other. For example,when we continue learning more and more well stay one step more near of our challenge and we need continue to the same way. In summarize,Im agree with Emersons statement because we always need to be more that we were yesterday. The success,the opportunities,better condition of life and the happiness is part of never stop grow.

410,3476,FF190BD8380B,"My grandma always said, "" Is ok to fail, the only thing that matters is to stand up and keep trying."" A decision is the act of deciding something, as a controversy or question, by reaching a conclusion or making a judgment. If people take their own decisions, they are going to benefit. People should take their own decisions because it is a right, people can learn for the consequences of their actions, and people have the ability to think by themselves. Many argue that people should visit a guidance to take decisions because guidance may have more experiences solving problems. However, they are wrong because in the past people fight and die for rights, and now that everyone have the privilege to talk for themselves they are not going to let others to decide for them. Clearly, people do not need to visit a guidance in order to made a good decision. Initially, citizens have the right to take their own decision. For instance, Generic_Name, who is a citizen of the United States, wants to get the divorce because he found his wife cheating on him. To specify, he went to the court to get the paperwork done for the divorce. To detail, he have the right and the privilege to get the divorce because it is human right; he do not need the help of any guidance to made this decision because is something too personal. One should observe that taking decisions is a right that everyone is able to reach. Additionally, people can make mistakes, but they have the capacity to emend them. For example, Generic_Name, for peer pressure, take a wrong decision about using drugs. To add, she realize that what she did were a wrong decision, and she understood that is bad for her health and she staunch doing it. Clearly, society can make people do what they do not want, but is in one to say: no; and fix what they did wrong. Last, but not less important, everyone have different ideas and points of views, and because of that people should make their own decisions. For instance, Generic_Names parents teach him to differentiate between good and bad; that means that he is not going to be in troubles for a bad decisions. To illustrate, he do not need the help of others to make a good choice. Obviously, humans are unique and sometimes people do not going to agree with others, but that does not means that one is wrong and the other is right; people need to respect others decisions. In summary, taking decisions is a privilege that ancestors gave us, people are going to made mistakes in order to success, and everyone is qualify to talk by themselves. These prove that citizens should not need to see a guidance in order to made decisions. People must respect others points of views and do not judge them for what they do. There is only one choice: respect and always have present that no matter what others said you can do it!",7,7,7,7,6,7,3887,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

413,3658,E4643D2ADD0A,"People who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas. I agree, because it gives them more experience to use their brains more, it makes people develop more, and it helps you from being dependent all the time. Using your instincts gives people more experience to use their brains more. Some people dont use their common sense to solve problems, because theyre afraid that theyre going to make it worse. Its okay to make mistakes. For example, If youre going on a trip with your family, and you find out that theres going to be a traffic in the morning, what will you do? Wake up early in the morning before the traffic forms. Thats how you use your brain. You think and plan ahead before things go bad. People developing more is great for your brain, because it makes you smarter and brighter. More ideas can be useful if you put your mind into it. For example, if you want your boss to be impressed by you, you need to act and use your instincts to create new ideas. It can help you be successful and more reliable. Instincts help you from being dependent all the time, because you wont be able to be with your friends forever. You have to use your common sense to help you along the way to your adulthood. Having a couple of friends is nice, but your going to have to act and deal with life yourself. For example, youre in your apartment and you need to pay a bill for your car. Youre going to have to call the bank that you want to pay for that car. Your friend does not need to tell you to pay for the things that you own. Being independent is important in life. In Conclusion: Some say that people who value self-reliance define it as the need for each individual to follow his or her own instincts and ideas, because it gives them more experience to using their brains more, makes people gain more common sense, and it helps you from being around your companions all the time. Counterclaim: Not everyone can use their common sense, because theyre not born that way. Sometimes, people dont know how to be independent, or maybe they just dont want to.

And another hand my central opinion to work in group will give you the best beneficial because if one of the student get sick the other student can continued to work, that way we can not stop working. And alway work together will supported the idea with the specific information, Another importan examples is if you working in group you can asked to you group for help, you can shere the work, either one in the group can provide the better ideas and following information in order, that way all together we can planned the work before writing.

Firts,Im explain my topic whith details a person who is due something for class always need help for others students for example: All the students have differents opinions,but only one is the leader of the work they must be discuss the problem and star working. The people on the group dont have the same idea that the others have the work is amost finish but is not good enough,they present the work but is not good,the leader say I dont acept this work becuase is incomplete the students talk more the topic and they star working again in the problem. The people in the group never say I dont want to due this work,becuase all the people have to prove her self,they say maybe the work is not good but we cant make this again,you never have to felt that you cant not due becuase you cant grow no matter what happen you cant due again and star again. Second,In situations you feelt that the things that you due or make are wrong ,but in not becuase the all the people in this world have a second or three changes to improve,and if you make a mistakes first is not matter that you have to made the same mistake again,you must be improve your self,world,class,and the people that you have you never have to feel grow becuase that word is not exist for a person who every day is triyng to make a good work. My other example is a person who is guilty to due a crimen and this person want to have a education to grow like a human that we are they must be giving the oportunity to study no matter what he due or make because all the people have the same staight. I know that many people are gona to be upset with me becuase they must think, a person who make a crimen dont need a second change but for my opinion the have a second change becuase they are in jail for the crimen and the want to grow to be a better person. All the people in the world have a second change becuase if you make something that you are not prove you must be make that again you never have to say I dont want to due this or I dont have a might to make this,that is wrong you cant due everything in this world is possible, and I know that this people are annoyance for what I think but is only my opinion becuase nobody want to be in jail and never learn somehing for your future, the people who is upset with me why they dont think if you are in the same situation you have to think in you and also the other people to make this world a little better. In my conclusion, the people have always a second change to grow,the human that we are we have to think in us but also in the others person like example: this text is for a world to make this a better place to live, becuase all the people in this country is fortunate becuase have so many oportunities to grown and be prepare for te future in other hand I come from a country that dont have opportunities but my goal is to be a better person today, tomorrow and for my future.

It depend from the knowledge of a students if he/she can take everything on his/her heat. May be more time led the students to know what they want to do after the High School, and have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative. Depend from the knowledge of the student if he/she can take everything on his/her heat because some students have the capacity to learn a lot without forgered and other not, possibly they have apathy in some classes or they are more interested in other things since in some school districts offer progams that can contein clases that students dont want to learn. But, it can be very helpfull for the students that want to graduate so fast from the high school becuse may be they want to work without a interuption from high schools things or the want to go the colledge without they had a lot of time in high school.

For example, you are graduate today but in a week or a month you are doing nothing because you dont know what you want to do but you need something with your life. Also, if you want to graduate so fast from high school you need a plan like; ill work after high school because i need money, or i want to study more because i think i need to know more and i want in my future. For example: the people who work after high school is the people that knows whar they want without matter the time that they took in the high school and the people who still stiding is because they arenot ready to know what they want or they still studing for a carrer. Have elective classes can help the students to be a good worker in the future because they are more creative, and elective clasess led the students to learnd new things that can help them in the future and in their usually life. For example: if they take an art class they will be more creative, if they take a music art they can have their own record. Also , elective class give more oportunities that a progam that conteins the usually class and borred. Finally, summer is a good time to take a break from high school and you have the oportunity to be in a class Online if its difficult for you to remenber something during that time. In conclusion, some programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years are good for the students who knows what they want to do after the high schools like if they want to work or if they will still studing. Also take a little bit time to graduate is not to bad because you never will to know what new things can you learn in the elapse of the time you keep have the oportunity to think more in what to do in the future. Also, if you have the capacity to remenber things for a log time is not too bad the idea to graduate in three years.

419,2234,C454239AC43D,"I dont think our school needs to follow this model by extending school for an extra two hours. We need to be in school for seven days a week to learn and be productive in working on assignments, projects, tests or quizzes. We also be in school to be active in working and socializing with students and teachers. If we are in school for a seven day period, then students and teachers would involved in helping each other more and getting some work done that they were absent for or helping them work they have to turn in or they need help understanding the information they are given. My first reason is that we should be in school for seven days instead of 4 days. If we are in school for seven days, then the students would be learning more about what certain topics the teacher is talking about. Another thing is that students can work hard on assignments that are due within two days or week. Also if they if are absent or just need help , then students can make up work by staying after school to catch on anything they have missed or just come in for extra help if they need it. One example would be if I were absent for like day or more, I could make up the the assignments that I missed by staying after school to make them up. Or having to just coming in to get extra help on assignments that I dont get or having trouble on. My second reason would be that teachers will be there for seven days to help you with anything. If you dont get what assignment is asking or understand it, then a teacher can help you by reading it to you or explain it to you. Teachers will be there everyday to help you with anything that will help you succeed in their class. Also they will be there to help motivate you in getting good grades in any of your classes and passing them. My second example would be If I didnt understand the information or just give up on the assignment, a teacher would be by my side. they would motivate me to never give up and always try to do your very best on any assignment that was difficult for me. My third reason would be students would be engaging with other classmates. Students and classmates dont have to only engaged in helping each other with assignments. During a seven day week, students can talk with their classmates or friends during lunch or if the teacher allows you to talk. Also your classmates or friends would love to ask you if want to participated in after school activities or clubs. My third example would be If my classmates or my friends ask if you want stay after, I would say yes. Then I would get involved with my with my classmates or friends and start talking with them. Some people think that having a four day school week would be better for them. They think if they have school for four days only, they would have nothing worry about. Like for example, they wouldnt worry about much work needs to be done or how the work will affect how they are. Also what grade you will get on a assignment or when to turn in your assignments. Some people think that having a four day school week for be bad for them. Students would be worrying about what they got on a assignment or test. Others would be panicking when to turn in assignments or when you can make up a test or quiz. Like for example, If students only had four school days to turn in assigments or make up a test or quiz, then it make the students feel bad for themselves or they can feel sad and sorry for themselves. Also they wouldnt know how they did on a assignment,test,quiz and what grade they got on it. In conclusion, Students and teachers would much rather a seven day school week then a for four day school week. Then students can work hard on their work, while the teacher will be there to help with help or any questions that you have. Also if the students are having any trouble besides work, then the teacher will be by your side to help you or motivate you to make you feel proud of youself.",8,6,7,8,7,8,2654,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

I personily believe students graduate in four years because they will have time to retake a class or SOL if they need to do. I think its head for some of the student to work and graduate in three years instead of four years. The most immopat think is that if the students faill a class they cant graduate the hight schools befor they pass the class they faill.

423,3657,8AD96DB8DD9F,"Do you agree or disagree with ""imagination is more important than knowledge""? I agree with this statement because it helps you when your reading books, studying, and learning. I learn more when I imagine things at school or other places. To begin with, I like reading books because it helps me when Im mad or just in general. Comedy books are one of my favorite to read because it cheers me up more than anything beside music. I like imagining things when I read because it makes the story more interesting like people talking in my head. Imagining helps me learn more because I am a slow learner I dont learn fast like other kids do so I like to sit down and imagine all the things the teacher was talking about so I can catch up with the class. Also, Imagination helps me a lot when it comes to studying because I am not good at remembering things. Studying is not my thing yet because there are big words I dont understand especially when it comes to English and math. English is more of smart people stuff I get so lost in English because we do a lot of work at once and the confuses me. English taught me new things I never knew before like having a introduction in every paragraph. In addition, Learning is hard when you have a lot of kids in the class playing and not letting the other kids learn. Some people take learning as a joke but I take it seriously because I want my dreams to come true I always wake up in the morning happy to go to school to learn something new. Learning is important it helps people get to where they want to be either its a dream, a location or read and write things. It is all imagination it helps a lot of people each and everyday by studying, learning or reading books because I enjoy it a lot it helps me fill up my emptiness. In conclusion, I agree imagination is more important than knowledge because it a it of people just like it helps me. Learning is important because it helps you reach your goals in life, and studying is not my thing but imagination helps me with studying because I can imagine the things we talked about. Reading books is more important to me because it cheers me up when I am mad so I dont pop off and say things I regret saying ",9,7,8,7,9,7,1845,"conventions 7, grammar 9, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"
424,777,234F1BA430B7,"Why is it important to learn the experience from others? Its important because you know what youre going to do or you know what youre going to see. For example when my cousin went to another country she told me about her experience, and that puts a thought to my head of she did and what she saw. Therefore when i went to the country she went i experienced what she did and what she saw. When your friends or family members share their experience with you, you start to imagine what theyve expericenced and that sometimes leads to preparing because theyve told you what theyve experienced from them they can prepare you. For example your family has a thing where all the boys in the family try out for basket ball, and you ask your older cousin how was their experience went and what they did good and bad. So you know what the coach wants to see and what he doesnt want to see that means you can show off to the coach and that can help you make the team and make your family proud and keeping the legecy going and when you can share your experienced with your brother when its his time to shine. Learning from others experience leads to good things like making a team,preparing,proving people wrong,improving, and some lead to bad things like youre new student and a bunch of girls see youre hanging out with a girlwho has had bad experience with them come up to you and tell you about their experience with the girl, and that makes you think shes so nice and that makes you not want to be her friend from ther experiece with her , or your best friend and you have the same science teacher but different blocks and your best friend tells you that the science teacher is very nice and when it gets time to go to your science class the teacher isnt as plesent as your best friend shared with you.

426,301,3CACE02FBD5C,"There is a debate about if do we accomplish more if we are always doing something or does inactivity also serve a purpose. Some people think that is not necessary be always doing something. They feel that they need to have some extra time to be with their family and be a person that always is doing something will take away that time. In my opinion is more satisfactory be always doing something because the more you are busy doing good things or thinking and what you can do is a help to not get involve in horrible things or and drugs, you will have the opportunity to be able to give all your family need and deserve, and also you will have the satisfaction of be a good example for your kids and a support to the society. The people that is involve in drugs, the people that get out to the streets to steal to can survive those people easily give up and did not try to find another way to get ahead, that people who make drugs, to sell drugs or the ones that consume drugs that people are living a dangerous life they are always hidden for the police or hidden because bad people are looking for them. They probably did not have another option or just they did not effort on doing something and all that thoughts became to do what they thought was easy. Being a person that is active and always is making new things that person can be certain that they family will have everything. That person know that their kids will have the opportunity to go to school and get a excellent education. That person know that in the house will never be short of food, clothe and health. All that and more you and your family will have if you make the right choices and keep always doing new things or always be doing things and keep busy. Now in our society good and hard working people is almost are scarcity because now some people the work in some countries the people doe not want to work they prefer be in their home doing nothing. But the people who is working those people are making the change for this society that people will become a example for all the kids but they will be a support a big support for the community. There are some reasons why I think that the people that is always doing something accomplish more that the people that does not do anything. Is a complete satisfaction to know that all the you have is because yo worked for it and you work hard and like Thomas Jefferson said the determination never be end is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing something.

On the other hand if you have some one on your back that do have more experiences them you they will be correcting you and bodering bothering you. Some people think that is better to follow some one decitions, but others think that is better to be alone because you must create your own decitions and follow yours rules is like you have a family no one is going to correct what are going to do with your family you dont follow others people they may be incorrect and you are correct and is better to be alone becuse you make your onw family whit your decitions and your rules. To begin alone is better because you make your experiences from the mistakes. you make your own decitions, but went you make a decition that coust you a mistake you get to have more experiences from the mistake that you did and went you have experiences from the mistake you learnd from the mistake that you need to be more responsible went you have a mistake you get to have a big experiences and that make you more strong and what you do and that makes you feel good and you become more responsible from the things that you do form the experiences that you have some people see that and they will have a hope on you and that you are going to be some one in the future and they will know you better because you are alone and not with some one that has more experiences you will raise you and your decitions. Another think is that you must follow your own rules that you make. When you make your own rules no one is going to say some think to you they will follow your rules if they want to be with you however if you are with some one that has more experiences you must follow their rules and you dont want that to happent went you make your own rules and follow your rules you will know what is goint to happen but if you follow some one else rules you must be awear because you dont know what is going to happen, so is better to make your decitions your rules because you know that is good from what are you going to do so make your own rules and follow your own rules dont follow some one else rules you become more strong and more smart person.

To conclude people must make their own decition, they should not be with some one else that has experiences or some tipe of company you must star from zero and trow the procces you will get to have some experiences from the mistakes that you did while you where working and wnet you have more experiences you will get to be more storng and you will grow in the things that you know and some people look at you and they will have a hope on you that you will make it to the end.

Those who believe schools should offer classes online have their reasons because research shows that 80% of the students that go to high school work after school. They get home late and they have to do homework, and they go to bed too late and having to wake up at least at 7 am to go school its hard. They are falling asleep in class and they dont want to do any work. Taking classes online helps because they can take them at anytime. Also, some students have to walk to get to school. In winter they have to suffer all the cold weather and thats what make them sick. Last year I saw a student who broke his arm cause it was snowing and the sidewalk was really slippery,and I also saw a guy who got beat up by a group of guys on the street he was on his way home,and if they can take classes online they would not have to walk to school, and those situations wouldnt happen. In addition, research shows that 70% of the students that have attended classes online have been successful which means taking classes online really helps students. They can rest more at home and they dont have to wake up early every morning.

This sounds like a good idea in theory, but when you think of it only in the educational field is really a terrible thing to do. As people; We all want to be praised for how we work and we can only get better if we practice something over and over and over again and can get even more if we`re happy with what we`re practicing and happiness comes with every praise. But if all we got while learning was praise but nothing to improve on then what would be the point to continue learning if all we get is a ""this is amazing"" or an A+ on every assignment they got. They would improve but students also develop zero tolerance to any criticism and probably going to want all the attention focused at them. A great example to this would be any artist; artists are based all around the idea of everything they make are things that theyll hate even if theres true improvement. they get praised but thats not what drives them to do better its the hatred of what they do that gives the motivation to improve and even take criticism with a grain of salt but use it to get better. Using what we learned from any artist it`d be a terrible thing to do, as the purpose of a student is to learn and use what they learned in the world and in the world theres going to be people who criticize what they do and if they cant take that criticism they`re most likely gonna get fired. In conclusion. I`m not saying that praising to much is a bad thing and i`m also not saying you should make the student hate what they`re doing.

436,113,DFB7AB4481AC,"I think that people can success without having the cosists of failure without loss of enthusiam. Theres other way to success without failing, one of them is to practice. An another way is sometime you can get it on your first time without have to fail. Then you can just study others failure and not make them same mistake, or sucess and try to do the same. These are other way to success without having to fail, and they are maybe more ways also. So Winston Churchill isnt wrong, theres still other success with out failure. First you can practices, practices makes you better that thing to want to success with. It like you cant success to be the best soccer player if you dont practices. So instead of taking the test or what ever if you practices, you might not fail, youll be ready for it or good to do it. If you want to success in a sport, you can success by practicing you can build mussel memory that can help you in many ways. If you want to success on a test you can practices on practices tests, that can help you out. That one of the ways you can success without failure. Also you can success by getting it are on you first time, theres some time people do will on their first time without having to fail, practices, or study. They are mostly lucky when that happen, and it does happens much, but they still success. Most people like to call this, winging it, some people might success, and some might not but that a other way so still success. it might be the best way success, but might have done it and success for it. Another way people can success, is by watching others failure and success. When you watch others failure you can study and try not to make the same mistake as they did. So if you saw some player or some slowed down when they were about score, but they miss or someone block them you can say, ""they shouldnt have slowed or whatever that would have help them. So when it your turn you can try to not make the same mistake and success. You dont just have to watch their fail, and can also study their success and try to do the same thing. So by watch others people success and failure, you can copy their success or improve their failure. So Winston isnt wrong you can success form your failure. By look on your mistake and improve them and making youll self better, at what you have trouble at. Failure without loss of enthusiasm is better then getting so mad about it and might make it easier to success next time. So I dont agree with Churchills statement, because their is more then just failure to success. Theres so much way to success with having to fail. You can practices, study others failure and success, and sometime success on you first time by winging it. So those are some reason, why i dont agree with Winston Churchill.",7,7,6,6,7,6,3183,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
437,655,52B24BAEDC8C,dear TEACHER_NAME i think the you should let students use their cell phones during free times like lunch time and in class when their teacher give them free time in class or during the morning because i think its not fair because only teacher can use their phones and not us because what if we get an emergency call like the teacher and we have to go home because thats what the teachers do when they get and emergency call they get sub and go home what if something like that happens to us what if someone has and a emergency like get hurt in p-e time or something else because thats why we get phones for an emergency so thats why i believe is better to let students use their cell phones on free time or lunch time or an emergency call because something might happen on time or they want to talk to their friends on my space or internet to talk to their cousins or family or want to call their family to know what are they doing or if they are ok or if they need enything or if their parents are going to pick them up after school or have an appointment with the doctor and i think their phones need to turn off when they need to when the teacher tells them to turn them off because other students are going to get distracted and might not pay attention on what there doing and they are not are going to do,5,4,6,5,5,6,1081,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Saying so, its a really good idea that we can get the chances or we can do the activities anywhere, anytime we like. Activities are or can be educational, many activities can help a lot, on something someone missed or failed a subject in school. It helps the brain work a little harder then other basic stuff that arent educational. School activities are really educational in many ways, anything that helps or can helps study on anything. Studying is a great reason why we can do fun activities with the subject someone wants to relearn, practices, or just for the feels of it.

440,563,04ACA7EB3994,"No,I dont think students should attend online classes from home. Because online classes might be sometimes harder for them to understand and to get help. It is always better to take classes in the person so students can learn better and get more experience and they can easily get help from the teachers whenever they want to. Online classes make people lazy and dont went them to do anything. They should get experience of going to school so they can learn more better. In my opinion in person classes are way better than the online classes. And it help students to be on time always. Students should take the classes in person so they can attend school daily and get more active. It is totally different experience by taking classes online or in person beacuse sometimes its hard to understand from the online classes and students cant get it. Online classes are good for the students who need to graduate early and they cant have more in person classes so they can take the classes online and graduate on time. online classes make students lazy and dont they dont do it on time and they get lazy by staying at home. Online classes might be harder sometimes than the in person classes. Some people are used to online classes because they feel they are more easier for them. online classes are good for students who want to complete their all the required credits. Some people dont get time to do the online classes beacuse they have to go to work and they cant able to finish everything on time. They put more effort by going to school and sometimes they just dont feel like doing to online class. Online classes are good for those who wants to complete there courses early. Students should attend school so they learn more better. Sometimes online classes might be pressure for some students because its alot of them to do it and it depends on them whenever they want to do it and they should finish before the end of the school year and itmight be more stressful for them to complete everything soon. They should try there best to attened school beacuse it is more better than doing the online classes. Online classes make some people lazy and they dont get experience of going to school. They should go to school and attend the classes so they can do all there work in class and get help from teachers whenever they feel difficulty beacuse getting help from online classes are harder it is a bit harder to get help from internet because some people dont understand them and it is more easier when they get help in person and they can understand everything easily and ask questions whenever they would like to. While,Some people might say yes it is better to attend online classes rather than going to school because they have to work in the morning and they dont get time to come to attend in person classes because they dont feel like going to attened them so they attend them at home. Students dont get much things in online classes and the feel difficulty sometimes and its hard for them to get some help from someone. Becasue if they go to in school classes they can get more help and they can get help for them to go to college. They can ask their counselour about how to apply for the colleges they want to get admission. They can get know whats going on in school and they can attend many activites in school and take some electives classes so they can learn more. Some people just want to take the classes online becasue they dont have the time to go to school. Some students attend both online and in person classes beacuse they cant get enough classes at school in a year and they want to graduate on time so they take online classes so they can finish everything on time. It is little harder to attend both at a time beacuse they had to go to work too and they dont get time to do online classes. One of my friend jose he had done the same. He had to graduate on the same year but he was missing one class and he was not able to graduate on the same year so he went to his conseolur and he asked him what can he do to graduate on the same year so she gave him the idea for the online class and he started doing it. He felt it little harder but he was able to finish on time and he was able to graduate on time. Some students are always late on doing on online classes because they dont have enought time to do it If students get to in schools they get to know more about school and be more responsibility and they can get more education so they dont feel difficulty when they go to college they should always have experience of high school so they dont have any problem in college later on. And students put more effort in class because they have to get good grades so they can get good GPA and easily get admission in the college they want to. Online classes are sometimes harder depends on what class are they taking. Maths class might be harder to do in online classes beacuse you always need someone to help you because you might have so many questions and it will be harder to do maths in computer. In conclusion,I would say it is better to take classes in school so students can learn more better and its more easier for them. In person classes are always better and students can get more help and understand better. Students can take part in activites. Students get more active by coming regularly to school. By coming to school daily it helps students to learn more and they get good experience for coming to school by making new friends and getting to know more about school. And they wont feel any difficulty beacuse there will be someone who can help them whenever they want to. By taking online classes students dont learn more like they can can learn in school classes. Students should take the online classes only if it is needed them to complete all required credits they want to graduate. Online classes might help some people and they feel more comfotable. But in my opinion i would rather take in school classes because it would help me in future by getting good experience of highschool and learn more",7,7,8,8,7,7,59,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
441,1769,B3493FBE6476,"Distance learning is a great option for students to attend classes from home. There are many students that fail the grade just because they dont attend their classes at school. This is a great way for students to still take classes and learn more their education. The generation from now arent as motivated as generations before. Theres might be a some people that wont agree with this statement because they probably think going to school is better than taking classes online or conferencing from home. Some people may say that it isnt a great idea for schools to offer distance learning for students especially the parents. Most parents would want their kids to go to school and take classes because they think its better for them. They probably think that theyre are ways to cheat if they take classes online. Some parents would want their kids to interact with other students and not just be home all the time. I agree on all the reasons why they student shouldnt take distance learning as an option but I think otherwise. Its a great option for students because there are many student that fail or drop out of school just because they didnt attend school. If students had the option to take classes online from home then it would give them a second chance to pass and graduate so they wouldnt give up. It even may help other students understand the curriculum more. The generation now are giving up at such a young age just because they dont even want to attend their classes at school. This is why its a great idea for schools to offer distance learning so students wont just give up and drop out. Having the opportunity to take online classes from home with probably help those students the dont want to attend school. The students would take classes from their homes and learn the same information they would learn at school. In conclusion, I think it would benefit many students if schools offered distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. Its a great way for students who dont like attending school most of the time. It would be a great advantage for students to have that offer of distance learning, it woud make a huge difference for the generation of students now a day.

My reasons is to travel to many places Ive never been to, buy many things as I want without spending my family moneys, and I would try many different foods that could be expensive. One reason why my accomplishment is getting a high paying job is to travel around the world or place that I never been to. Traveling around the world could be really expansive since your going to buy many things you would need or dont need. Sometimes traveling depends on where you are going since some places are cheap or expansive. Having a lot of a good amount while traveling is a good because you could do anything you want with that money while your not at home. I think having a high paying job is good for traveling is not always cheap, you can buy anything youve ever wanted and not worrying much about using to much money. The next reason is to buy many things as I want without spending any or some of my parents or family members money. This is important because it wouldnt matter much if you used you own money but if you use your family money you might have to pay them back later on. Another reason is going out when you want to and you dont really want to spend your family money because you need a lot since you could be going to many places. When you want to take your family out to a really nice place or a place where you think they would enjoy or relax, you can just surprise them by already getting it done and paid off. Another reason it is a good idea to get a high paying job, to not spend your family money. The last reason is trying many different foods that could be expansive. From my experiences I know that most places has really expansive food that is really good. I also know that going to a super fancy restaurant is expansive since all the foods could be really good or just a rip off. Sometimes going to really fun places or vacations foods are expansive because it could taste good and many people would might want to try some, also if it was cheap many people wouldve gone crazy. Paying for good expansive food is worth it then paying too much for something that taste bad. In conclusion that a high paying job is good for traveling to places youve never been to, spending lots of money without using your families money, and eating or buying really expansive foods. Going to places you have never been to is great. Spending our own money lets us buy anything we want. Also buying or trying new foods is really nice when you can buy it.

444,3858,7797541CF0A6,"The succes is what people really want all the time, but it is not easy at all. Sometimes we have to pass throught dificults situationt to get to the sucess. Each person want to be succesful in life, but to get what we really want, we have to be positive with the head up. We dont have to put ourselves in an unconfortable situation because it wont help us to get the succes that we want. It just going to help us to go through the way of failure. Not all the time going to be easy. We must have to fail a lot of time, it help us to see what we are doing wrong, and what we have to change to get what we want. We just have to keep going with enthusiasm and believe in ourselves. The sucess help to the people to be someone in life. We can see in our everyday how hard is life, and how we have to strive ourselves to get the sucess, but we can see that there are obstacles and we have to know how to pass through it. Life is hard, but nothing is imposible if we have already planned what we want. Sometimes we dont get the result on what we have been worked. But nothing can be hard at all, we have to know that all is posible, we dont have to take it as imposible. One example that we can see in our everday are the students in the university. Not all of them have the support of the family to cover the cost to pay the the clas in the university. Some of them have to work to get the money and pay their study. Some of them have to fail because its not easy to do at lot of things at the same time, but we can see that they keep going through it, doesnt matter what. To get the sucess we have to work and just focuss on what we want. At the end we can see the result. We must have to fail a lot of time, but we have to have in mind that we can do it. The people who graduate, at the end they remember how hard it was. But they believed in theirselves and also keeped their head up with enthusiasm, and learned of each mistake that they had done in the way to the sucess. Other example can be the student from other country in high school, at the end of each year the student have to do a test of each subjet they have. But is not easy fo them because not all of them speak english, they have to learn a lot and out themselves in a hard situation to do it. They have to effort a lot themselves, some of them have to fail like three time to pass the test. But they know that nothing is imposible if they believe in themselves. They know that they have to take tests to graduate, we can see the hispanic student in Generic_School, they have to take the ESOL test each year but they have to study a lot because their first language that they know is spanish, and they just have been in this country in a little while. For some of them the situation is hard, but at the end we can see them in their way to graduate and how proud they are of themselves because its not easy to learn english. Also, we can see the organizations that want to help to the people who doesnt have nothing, they have to do a lot of thing and have to be prepare because no one know if they gonna get what they want. The goverment and other institutions have to aprove the organization and one of the best examples is Shakira and her fundation Pies Descalso"", she wants to help to the children with the eduation, and alimentation. She had to do a concert to get the money to start with her fundation, she has been in hard situation but she always believed in herself. We can see today how she had changed the life of millions of children around the world, how bennefitted with education and alimentation they are. child from poor families are now someone in life, some of them are in the university. All can be hard but never imposible. She accomplish her dream, doesnt matter what. In her way, were obstacle and difficults things. But she didnt give up because of that. People have to know that doesnt matter what they can achive what they really want and keep going in their way to the sucess. Nothing in life going to be easy but they have to know that dreams can come true. They must have to fail a lot of time in the persuit of sucess. But they have to know that nothing going to be in the way they want but they can keep going until they can achive their purpose. Doesnt mattter how many time they have to fail, if they want to be someone in life they have to know that the way have a lot of surprices but thay have to have in their mind that nothing is imposible if they see that situation in that way. We all can be succesful in life, we just have to belive in ourselves and keep in mind that no one can make us feel less than them, we all are equal, we all have dreams and we all can achieve what they want in life to be successful.

446,1078,523130079501,"""Their are advantages of cell phone usage in class but their even more disadvantages to it."" cell phones arent great for students to use in classroom because it cause distraction and make students not focus while teachers give instructions. Teenagers get so easily distracted by anything because they are careless and arent aware. Phones arent beneficial nor useful. Students should use either school or home laptop it is more beneficial and useful than cell phones and in that ways teachers will be easily find out what they have done in class. First of all, the reason why cell phones arent useful for students in classroom for educational purpose its because of distraction; that will bother the whole class ,and might bother teachers too. Since cell phones are one of the rule to be use in class then all have to follow it. For instance, if teacher assign work for students to do during class on their phones imagine what will be the result nothing might be done by the end. Laptops have big screen so that teachers can follow up with their students. With cell phones is difficult for teachers to know weather or not the student have done something in class. Students have good tricks especially teenagers. They might be acting like they are working but truly they are messaging ,and once the teacher approach he/she change the page so they can show evidence that they are working. Teachers are even smarter they know how to deal with students like this. They either sit with them to help them out or ask to come after school if they really struggle and cant do nothing. In this situation is a good idea for teachers to collect phone before class starts and hand them back by the end. Any advice could be more useful then cell phone. That is also the reason why cell phones arent beneficial. Additionally, cell phones arent always beneficial the reason why is because it distract easily. It cause problems between students. For example, if their are two students playing soccer on their phone how will they focus; they cant control themselves one shout happy scores ,and the one who lost want to beat the other guy who win and so on. Cell phones shouldnt be use at all in class but only with teachers permission. It will be even better if two teachers help out in the class with work. They both will help students pay attention and participate. Both together will be able to control phones usage. It is hard when you are working on an essay and suddenly a message pop up you cant control yourself ,and you cant focus just because of the message you are carious and really want to know what is happening. That is the reason why cell phones shouldnt be use in class just because of distraction and the impact that might happen to students from using it. However not everyone agree, some argue that cell phones is great to be use in schools for educational purposes. First think about the disadvantage that could happen with this use or rule. Think about others and how that might effect them. Will you be able to control yourself if you receive a text from a friend?. In fact, there are many things that might cause distraction but one of the biggest distraction are cell phones ,however, any other things can be control. Any other device will be okay because it will easy to be seen by teachers. Cell phones wont help you at all however it will bring your grades down and it will bother you. Not everyone have same opinion other have positive view on the use of cell phones. Which is okay but think about it more. Look to its positive and negative impact on students and you fill find the answer. Why most students will agree with the use of cell phone in class?. Some student arent always aware of what they are doing and they are careless. They think messaging or whatever they are doing in class is more important then their grades. Students should avoid all distraction such as food, cell phones, and music to help our society develop.

447,1584,B744CD534ADB,"Dears, teachers of Generic_School. First, I think that we all should work alone, because each student can be working for their self with out any other help from students that do not care about their projects or homework, all students has different ideas, working in a group would be more stressed for the student, they may not have the opportunity to show their own ideas working in a group. However, working in a group sometimes can be helpful but working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, working alone, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade, working in a group one of the persons can be the only one who does all the work. In addition, working alone can be the best way to show our own ideas because everyone has different opinion about the projects or the homework and how is going to be, working alone should be more helpful for the student who had different opinion in their topic. In my English class we all were working in groups, well in my group were three people one of the group was at their phone seen social media, and doing nothing, I ask if he needs help and if that was the reason why you are not helping us to do our project, I said, he just answer and said dont ask me, thats not your problem, he was unreasonable but there wasnt nothing more that I can do for someone who do not want to work, thats one of the a lots of reasons why is not helpful working with a group. Wherever, I believe that working alone is the best way to show up our mind and be sure that we can do all that we want to do, some people think that working in a group they can get done more fast any projects but I think that we should work alone because there is some people that do not care about their subjects and sometimes the teachers think that they just do not want to do nothing but there are people that we really want a good grade, working alone let the student to focus more in their own work than someone who is stressed about if his partner is going to help or not. Some people said that working in a group its more fun than working alone but I think that working alone some times can be also fun because you make your own rules and use your own imagination. In conclusion, students should work alone, each students can be working by their self and with out thinking if their classmate is going to help in any kind of project, all students has different ideas, working in group would be more stressed for the student, working alone can be more helpful to the teacher, the teacher would see who deserved a good grade. Working alone is the best choice, teachers considerate students ideas like the most big new option to improve our society, working alone is the best way to show our own ideas, by working alone students will be feel more confident about their work and more likely to explain their work. Finally, students can work for their self, and is not always necessary to work in group, sometimes work in group can be annoying and distractive by others students.",8,6,7,6,5,7,2464,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Thomas Jefferson wrote, "" Determine never to be idle ... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" We accomplish more if we are always doing something. Deligence leads us to a road of success. For example, The successful people are always willing to spend times and put efforts in their work. In history, a lot of leaders showed us that success comes from keeping doing and trying things over and over to make it what it is today. When we become deligent, we spend our time doing meaningful things. We become more efficient and tend to be more responsible for our lifes, it pushes us forward to our destinations in a good way. Experiencing lets us learn more. For example, We learn from books and documentaries about what other people have experienced or doing different things by ourselves then gain perspectives from it. Those things make us talented and gives us guides about how things might be when we grow up. It also gives us advantages when we encounter difficult things and try to deal with it. The more we experience, the more valuable and proficent we will be. While some people believe that we accomplish more if we are always doing something. Other argue that inactivity also serve a purpose, for example, They say that we only live once, why give ourselves such hardtimes and do not do things that make us feel comfortable and happy. Although this may be true, it will just makes us lazy and does not give our lifes meanings and purposes. We will accomplish more if we are always doing somthings. Deligence makes us have a positive attitude to put efforts in our works, we can become more responsible for ourselves. It shows us the passions. The more we experience, the more successful we will become. Gaining perspectives makes us be aware of what we can do in the future. we should keep doing things and learning knowledges for the better us.",8,7,8,6,6,8,2323,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
450,1136,279245CFCCF4,"An Old Proverb Says Honesty Is The Best Policy I agree about being honest at all times. Because thats how I was taught and even though I get in trouble, when Im honest its better than lying. Because lying can get you in to worst trouble. If your always honest people can always trust you and who doesnt want to be trusted? My grandma always told me that when you do something bad or lie karma is going to bite you hard. But, sometimes your going to have to lie for an important reason like hurting someones feelings, I think its a horrible feeling to hurt someones feelings am I right? However when your honest people will always respect you, like you, and honer you. For an example this has happened to me if your at school and your at lunch and everyone is supposed to be quiet and you and your friend start talking, a teacher calls both of you over and she said,""were you guys talking"" my friend said no and I said yes I was talking , and the teacher said, ""thank you for being honest you can go back and finish your lunch"" but, my friend got in trouble.

452,281,0C7D385D812A,"How should people take decisions?? thats the real question should a person follow a feeling or motion call instincts or should they make a decision by guidance by experts and the laws and authorities. Well a person should use advise really. For example lets say a business man has to make a decision about if he should invest money or not on a product thats been selling good for the last few months but in the pass they werent selling as much. so the business man has to go and get guidance with some experts because he doesnt want to make the wrong decision and make the company waste money they wont get back. Thats why having advisers are so helpful because there suppose to help people get out of any concerns a person has. They can guide and advice you to do things right. For example when a person is in high school that person has a guidance. That person is always going to be trying to help, there gonna help decide which classes are best for a student, and there gonna look in to the student and check why a student isnt doing good and after that there gonna try to help him so he can accomplish hes goals and graduate. Every time we take a decision over something serious we need to think about it more than once because if it is a decision like buying a house its life changing ether it can go really good or it can hurt you badly thats why its better to think about it and talk with an expert because its needed to know if that person is ready and its stable enough. For example if a person wants to buy a house theres a lot of responsibilities that come with that decision and he or she has to be ready that means theres no more playing around and settle down and he or she needs to think about it if thats what they really want. Take decisions it always has a grade of difficulty thats sometimes not even with the best advisers can help to make a decision being one hundred percent sure that thats the right answer. Sometimes you just have to trust youre instincts because a person has knowledge about the answer to the question but he or she think about the answer to much that they get them selves confused and thanks to that they make poor choices when really you should just trust the person is right. For example when a teacher tells a student on a test trust your instincts and dont think about the answer to much is because they know that he knows the answer. In conclusion its always better to have a person giving you advise about a question or problem, its easier to make good decisions when a person has help than when a person is alone confused and stress about a decision. But at the same time is good to trust your self and follow your instincts and not having to depend or need someones help.

453,24,2CDDE76979DD,"I believe that working with a group is better than working independently. I say that because work gets done faster with more people than just one person. Also More ideas would be brought up because other people in your group have different experiences. Another reason is People can get different parts in the work so it doesnt all depend on one person to do everything. My first reason why working with a group is better than working independently, because work gets done faster and is easier with more then one person. For example lets say i have a group project with 3 other people, I would split it into 4 different parts so one person doesnt have to do the whole project by him/herself. Another example is if you get stuck on some part while your working, your group can help you do it instead of asking other people that are not even doing the same thing as you. Also its easier because lets say Ur sick and you cant get your work finished, your group mates can most likely finish it for you so you wont get stressed out. My second reason why working with a group is better than working independently is you get different ideas and experiences from different people. For example if you had a essay about living in England, theres a good chance one of your group mates knows something about it or has experienced it by living in England. Another example is everybody thinks differently, so another person might have a idea that you never thought of or it could be the other way around. Also when you have more then one brain working on the same work then ideas keep coming up from each other like its a chain of some sort and you wont get stuck on anything. My final reason about why working with a group is better than working alone is your future. If you only work independently that means you arent really cooperative with other people or have much experience talking to others, which could effect what sort of job you get in the future. For example if you get a job as a PC support you have to talk to other people and ask whats going on with Ur device, which means cooperating with some random people and you need skills for that. Also if your a construction worker you need to work together to build a structure of some sort, so you would need communication skills for that therefore you really cant improve that if you work independently all the time. Some people might say working independently is better than working with a group while others might disagree because work gets done faster with more people, everybody has a different experience and knowledge about stuff and its better for Ur future because you have to cooperate with other people and you need skills to do that.

454,3556,D15E85D292CE,"""Cell phones"", for the main statement I must evacuate cell phones in school time. Students are often breaking ""expectations"" about using your cell phone in class. But some schools choose to use cell phones for educational purposes only during that time. Now, we should be able to see why cell phones are doing to the students of any school. Cell phones may disrupt students work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious. Cell phones may disrupt students work. This may happen when students play games or text in their cell phones. Probably when students might make them less focus on their work just checking social media. Students of many ages have trouble enough with their homework and also classwork. May cell phones be causing this to begin with? Maybe, just so we know cell phone may disrupt students work. Cell phones may make them feel misplaced. What I mean for that is a student just be on their cell phones a lot, an student may just feel better on their phone instead of doing work. which makes the student disconnect with class time. Not even using it to complete work making a opinion sound like a fact. As we know cell phones may make them feel misplaced. Cell phones may make them rebellious. Another meaning by this is to disrespect authority. ""Authority"" means the staff of the school of any kind of departments. Some students in blood are rebellious, but not the man made kind. They may feel furious when criticize for anything done on phone. They may feel like that anytime with the main disturbance of the classroom. So cell phones make them rebellious. Next,our argument against cell phones is extremely important to all others expect the students. Students will fight back other supporters of the opposite answer hes been fighting against. My counter argument settles the fact cell phones are not good in class room for any time. Now, students would be more efficient without cell phones than with cell phones. So, this has settled against everyone. In conclusion, Students think their doing a great work with a cell phone in deck. But in reality, it is making you more and more dependent with your mind. But many people actually learn from it. Either you have a learning style or make great grades with cell phones must see the negatives of this. Other students using cell phones may disrupt students work, make them feel misplaced, and make them rebellious.",8,6,7,6,6,6,2893,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
455,2342,EF1CF9E844F7,"I believe high schools students should not be expected to stick to a career, They are barely finding themselves. Choising a career a at young age can lead to mistakes like choosing something you dont enjoy. High Schools Program shoud be a way to help the future profesional to find what they are really want to be in the future, high school stage is one of the most important step for the young age students, Because there is when they choose their future, We need to work with them the best way is posible, We need to find out a programs that impulse them to continue students after high schools graduate. In some case parents try to tell their children what career they have to take, In that case if the students have to choose a career by the time they are entering to the high schools, Most probably will be their parents choosed what career they are going to take it, So that may be a mistake for the student because when they finally found themself, Probably they realize there were something else more interesting for them that they could take it, At that time would be too late. Also some students may take a career that doesnt make the money they were expecting, or choosing a career thats not fit for them, What the high school should be concern about is to form the best profesional for the future, Teaching them the best educations is posible and the same way showing them what kinds of career are there,The advantage and the disadvantage all the career have it. High schools programs should know theyre playing a really impotant roll in the future of the country, However the programs needs to be concentrated, should be educated the young guys the best way is posible, Create a programs to keep them away from problems like; Grugs, Alcohols, Gangs. This 3 problems are killing our new genetion, This is one of the reason why the students leave the schools at early time. Also the high schools needs to help the students to find the career that will make them be happy in the furute. Should not be the high schools expected to the students to identify a career before or at the time their are entering to the high schools. In conclusion, high schools students, In my opinion are not ready to choose a career yet, At their age they may not know what really want, or be ready to make such a big decision.",6,4,4,5,4,4,3503,"conventions 4, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 4, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

First, Students may find that the class is not of interest to them because they may want to learn about other subjects that could impact their future. Due to the students dissatisfaction and not being interested in the class they have a high probability for failure. For example, Generic_Name wants to reach his goal of going to a high end college but was not accepted because he had a GPA lower than the minimum requirement due to failing drama class. Second, Students can also have an interest in a certain job. Music, drama, or art can be a waste of time for the student because it is taking time from classes that can help towards getting that job. Taking these classes could also help the student explore more possible job opportunities as well as learning skills. Lastly, Some students would not take these classes serious. As oppose to essential classes like math, English, and history students would use these classes as an opportunity to horseplay. The students that are constantly participating in horseplay are going to be a distraction to the students trying to succeed in these subjects.

But No, Educators shouldnt make students break year-round school, where there should be a 3-4 week break in the summer, and a week off in spring and fall because they dont have as much time spending with their family and most students also have responsibility. The first reason is that they dont spend time with there family. School is taking there time when they go back home. Students comes everyday day at home to do their homework and make sure they have everything ready for the next day of there school life. Some even has projects to work on.

Thinking kindness is very positive and relaxing because it is a very good thing to do in life. Kindness will never be a bad thing because it is meant to change the future. No matter what, kindness could never go wrong as long as you try it to others. Spreading kindness around the world could change how people think, in terms of doing something bad is not part of kindness. Therefore, giving kindness to a person could spread around the world, and you would not even know that all this kindness was because of you.

Some may disagree with the quote because there is nothing else to learn . When I was in first grade I came to school not knowing any English. Honestly I felt isolated because the language barrier I did not know what the teacher was telling me. All I said was ""Yes"" and ""No"" thats all I knew. I think it was a few weeks later that they call my parents . They notify my parents that I was not doing well in school. My mother as always told me practice makes perfect.

In Christmas the year 2017, I got the probably the best and worst gift of my life. It was an X box one at first felt happy because it was my second gaming console, but I did not know how to use it. It took me two weeks to understand the full operation. Then when I starting playing the first game that I bought was Fifa 18 by the way I did not pay for the game it was my dads credit card. After that I downloaded Fortnite it was free so I didnt get in trouble . I found the games difficult , I started to practice a lot , then a few weeks later it became an addiction. I couldnt focus in school my grades were falling off where I had them before I got the X box one. My father told me if I did not get better grades he be forced to take away . So I started to focus on my grades ,but yet still thought the gaming console . Some may disagree that what Ralph Waldo wrote.

The one reason I agree is because theres time that you just cant have success. I have had that in my life in many situations. Once when I was playing soccer we had won all the games and then came to the day where we were playing for first place and we lost and that day all my enthusiasm was gone. I was so mad and just had no energy. I learned that there times that I wont win and times I will its part of life but along the way I learn new things. Then there school there you do go from failure from failure to success because once you make a mistake and you learn from it and do better next time because your already know now but it does bring your enthusiasm down. The next reason is that failure does does make you have success but also it make not encourage to keep going. From the first time you fail to the next will will learn something and later on when it happens again thats will you will get it. When you do fail and fail you lose enthusiasm but gain it back when you have success. You feel sad and mad and just not excited no more when you keep failing again and again.

Many persons positive and negative attitudes all depends on the difference on there personality. I agree having a positive attitude is the key to success in life, if negative attitudes didnt have a difficult time being happy. I disagree that negative attitude is always hard to be happy with life because sometimes good miracles happen. If there were more succesful people in the world everybody would be a positive atitude. Most of the people are mixtures of both atitudes. The attitudes affect peoples life so much on which atitude they have. In conclusion having a positive attitude brings a lot of success in life so, I think more people should have positive vibes. A person who has a negative attitude wont ever enjoy life at its fullest.

467,338,F60545D8271E,"I think that schools must have a after school homework club because students who are having difficulty in school can get extra help from teachers, students could improve their grades, and teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs. The first reason I think that schools must have an after school homework club is because students who are having difficulty in class can get extra help form their teachers and students. One time I had trouble understanding how to answer the questions my teacher gave to me about the civil war 2 years ago, and my teacher said that I could stay after school in the homework club and to meet her their. That was the reason how I understood how to answer the questions on the quiz. That is one reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club. The second reason why I think that schools must have a after school homework club is so students could improve their grades in their classes. One time I had a D in my science class because I needed more help with remembering the parts of a cell. My science teacher then told me that I could stay after school and go to the homework club with her to practice on the parts of a cell. One week later my grade went up to a B because my teacher helped me pass my test. This is the second reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club. The third reason why I think that schools should have a after school homework club is so teachers and students can work together to fulfill the students needs. One time I stayed after school for the homework club and a teacher was having a heard time explaining a question to a student who spoke Spanish. The teacher asked me if I could translate what she is saying to the student. the teacher and I both helped the student understand the question. This is the third reason why I think schools must have a after school homework club.

Although some say that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purposes, actually they shouldnt because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media and also students probably will try to use their cell phones to cheat. Those who believe that schools should allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purpose they have their reasons. They believe that it will be more easy for students to complete assignments and also it will help students to turn in their work on time. In my opinion I think that schools shouldnt allow students to have and use cell phones in classroom for educational purposes because students most of the time will be using their cell phones just to be in social media. I think that because when I am in my Algebra 2 class my teacher always assign us to complete some work that we have in blackboard,but what I noticed in the last month was that most of my classmates that were around me they werent doing the assignment instead some of them were just playing video games,watching videos in YouTube and using Snapchat. I think that schools shouldnt allow students to have and use cell phones in the classroom for educational purpose because students may use the cell phones to cheat. I believe that because such as a student if I was taking a test and I didnt study and I have the cell phone with me I will try to use it to find some answers in Google and also if students are allow to use the cell phones in the class they may use them to cheat by taking pictures of other student study guide,assignments and homework.

470,2260,A10E91E49973,"Yes, I do believe that imagination is important more than our knowledge. Albert Einstein is recognized as the most brilliant person who has ever lived. He used his imagination more than his knowledge, which made him accomplish so many things. He imagined things first, then used his knowledge to make that happen. If we couldnt imagine things, it wouldve been difficult for anyone to invent something or do a lot of things. All the inventors, who has invented things first used their imagination to create an image on their mind to see how it will look like, which helped them to make the item. Imagination helps us to accomplish our goal. It shows us what we can do to achieve it. Imagining helps us in many ways. I always think or imagine before I do something big. I always imagine before making a choice or decision because I do not know how it will turn out. Sometimes some people think its funny and laughs that imagination cant come true but I do believe that no matter how hard is to accomplish my success, I will always try. My parents always tells me to imagine what I truly want to be when I grow, which is amazing. I think many parents are strict and tells their children to stop imagining things and always study, which I believe education is very important but telling someone to stop imagining is not quite right, Once I read in a article where it said that imagining thing is a natural habit and you will imagine things unless you have disability or blindness. Once I also read a article that says that according to physcology imagining things is important for our brain . We imagine things everyday. When we are imagining things or just thinking, it helps to improve our brain. Scientist always has a prediction or imagines before doing an experience because they dont know what is going to happen. That helps them to be prepared so that if something happens their going to be ready for it. Albert Einstein had a an amazing knowledge also he believed that imagination is important, which made him be a successful person. There are so many celebrities, who wrote a quote about how imagining helped them achieve their goal. For example Taylor swift always imagined that shes going to be a singer when she was young and now she is a singer. Sometimes people can use imagination in a bad way like imagining to rob a bank but its not good, but they need to think deeply how it can affect them. If you also dont use your knowledge cant succeed because you have to use imagination and knowledge to succeed, you have to use both.

I would love to go and have a position there. Im interested to give it a try in your business. A professional like you can teach me how everything works and how you maintain everything under control with your employees. Also, it be delightful if i could ask questions about how is it difficult to be such a big person as a manager? Therefore,I choose your company because I feel like its great for me to start working in a place that i could be conformable with. And specially if its from a company with great quality and management. Also i can learn how to socialize with people. Learning how to communicate is important for a company so everything is in order. Some companies dont know how to communicate and to be organize. Theyve to be anti-social so they can focus on their work and not on other employees otherwise theres consequence. Some companies are very strict with their employees. For examples employees have to be obedient to every single thing. As in theyve to follow every step correctly or they would get fired or worst. Thirdly, Your company is understandable to your employees. You treat them with respect and love as if they were your family. I heard that if your employees had a emergency you would be generous and support them no matter what. I never heard one complain from your company either. However, its the exact opposite. people who works there seems to love it and to enjoy it! Theyve learned to be responsible and respectful in your company. You also are fair with your employees. Employees in that company gets payed well with no complains. They get payed exact the hours theyve been working. However, the way you manage your customers is incredible. Your customers are never disappointed what they order is exactly what they get. Employees always have a smile on their faces when receiving a customer. Theyre always gentle and polite. But more importantly patient because theyre a lot of customers who are slow or aggressive, they like to get attention. As great employees they handle any challenges. And i think its a perfect start for me because Ill do everything right with no excuses. In the other hand, your company is always nice and neat you make sure that the place looks good and prepared just in case important visitors come to visit your company. Mean while, i think the environment needs more companies as an this one. because everything about this company is splendid and spectacular. Theyve great service and employees. They make sure their customers come in and out happy. Your company takes responsibility for any errors that could happen. You also give great deals for customers. you teach your employees have to be a great worker. You give your employees plenty of time to get along with their job because you know that in the future they will do way much better. You also persuade your employees that they can do anything. That giving up is not a answer. I would like to be a outstanding person for your company. I want to tell everyone about how amazing your company is and how wonderful everyone who work there is. The organization in your company is great you keep everything in order. In conclusion, I think i am very interested in learning about your company more and actually try to work there. I want to feel that joy and that responsibility i have to have. I want to spend time learning and practicing in your company. Your company has shown me that not all companies are bad as they say nor terrible. In my opinion i think companies should be more like this one. So if i could get the opportunity to go and check it out and learn that would be amazing. Because i never heard of a company this generous before. And i would definitely would love to know more about it. Everything about your company is great for example communication,organization,employees and deals. It sounds entertaining and enjoyable.

473,2216,FBE180CF324E,"To begin, what are your thoughts on first impressions through peoples point of view? When two people interact with one another the impression is not always dependable because People are probably not themselves, People opinion change, People never have the same intellectual connection. For example Generic_Name went to the movies with his girlfriend Generic_Name, his mom Generic_Name, and his sister Generic_Name. Generic_Name tells Generic_Name to invite her boyfriend Generic_Name. Generic_Name interaction with Generic_Name was unpleasant, based on what Generic_Name saw their was a different perspective from one an other. Days later at night the family reunites and the perspective change from what Generic_Name thought at first and what she thinks now. Secondly, periodically all around the world people are not themselves when we first interact with them. Their is always a fifty- fifty chance that people, will get to meet their real personality. Why? First because they are starting to get to know new people. Second they have no idea what to expect from people. Third, some people do above and beyond to impress. Now in days many people try to make a good impression to belong to a certain group. Sometimes they are so use to doing it that they dont even recognize that is not their true self. Society has a huge impact on how people have to impress one another that it make others be afraid to show who we truly are. However, peoples opinion change from time to time. Visualize that we are going to the store just to buy one item. We end up buying more then one item what does that mean ? It means that are mind changes to what we want it to change to. We might set up a scenario in are minds to have very high expectations to those surrounding us ,when we are self dont have that confidence. For example Generic_Name was mad at Generic_Name for not going to the bank with her. So Generic_Namea said that they would no longer be friends. The next day she text her and said what time am I picking you up. Their was a change of opinion from night to morning. Lastly, people never have the same intellectual connection. When you first meet someone and we are aware we want to make a connection ,we try to have some conversation to talk about. For example when people have a right there connection is because they are interested and the same things as one another. When two people dont have the same to things to talk about other might think this person is not interesting enough. People would make comments like no , your not qualify to join this group, or anything that involves having to impress another person. In conclusion, first impression arent usually trustworthy because People are not themselves, People opinion change, and People never have the same Intellectual connection. Peoples thoughts will change eventually no mater if they had a good impression at first. First impressions never counts because we never know who might be fooling us for a job , friendship, or to be a partner. Society now in days have to look out more to make sure everythig is in order. Thats why we have people who do research and look back to records, thats why jobs and people have a process of doing things.

Around 200 articles said that students that attend online classes dont have the best projects just because they cant have other students opinion. For example, so many different ideas by having a group can be more interesting than only having a persons ideas. However, students would benefit attending classes from home because they can feel comfortable. Furthermore, a school survey showed that students prefer online clases because that makes them feel comfortable just to be seated inappropriate. I agree with these people because I like to be seated in many ways, but in school rules is only a way to be seated.

I believe, that kinds mentality about their career will change through out high school. Student should not be required to choose a career by the time they enter to high school, because they are inexperienced to know what they want, students could choose the wrong career, and unhappy of wasting their time on a career they are going to change their mind on.

It is like a head start on one the classes you take in high school, two the rest of your high school years, three the collage you want to get into. But there are always some downs to thinking and or knowing what you want to do before you even get to high school. Such as there might not be a class for what you want to major in. Or you might not be eligible for taking that class , they could be over booked in those classes. There might be mix ups with your schedule that may cause you not to get the class you wanted. Even when you have your mind set on one thing for your future your opinion may change over time it may even change completely. And it happens to a lot of students. They make up there minds and then maybe weeks later it may change into something else. There are also other issues with what you want to do in your future. Some students work full time jobs and its hard for those students to focus on one goal and keep up with school work , Sometimes even miss school just because of work. If you think about it even after graduating high school some still work and move on to collage and are still stuck in the mud with work and even harder homework and class work. So dont have a ride to school or even work. Money is a big issue as well. With having to pay for a car or even other life needs you might not be able to get into the collage you want to get into because of how expensive it is. There are student loans but you still have to pay that back and sometimes you can be late on payments but then that doubles and no one wants that. High school is where your future really begins really. Because if you think about it is where you start learning about where to get your start , how to start , when to start . This is where we as students decide what we want to do in life and where we want to go with it . And if we chose to chance our dream that thats where we end p with hard work and dedication.

482,129,6B3B3CB54EB9,"My opinion about conserve energy and resources. I have two points of view, the bad and the good one. I think this is a good idea but, it has bad things. I think if we want to conserve energy and resources we just need to have four-day school week. Four-day school week can be benefits for the people that have to work everyday, but it has a disadvantage and is that we are not going to learn to much like a five-day school week. My first point of view is that this can be good for many students. If my school follow this system can work for many students that have to work every day. First reason is that they can have one school-day off so they can go calm to the job. They can have that day off in school and job. Second reason is that, this can be good also for those students that skip school everyday, maybe if they know that we just got four-day school week they would want to come to school. Third reason is that teachers can have more time to work on projects and do all that work that they have to do. Second point of view is that is system can not be a good idea. First reason is that students would not learn as much as five-day school week. Second reason is that is going to be tired to be ten hours of school. Third reason is that two more hours of school are not a good idea for those that have a part-time, they would not be on time in their jobs. Two more hours of school can be frustrate for many students. My position on this issue is that this would not work. First reason is that many students that have to work they would like to go to school beacuse of two more hours. students that have to work start they shift at 5 pm and school would end at 6:04 pm, students would skip the last classes. I think if this is to conserve energy and resources it would not work beacuse is like they are adding part of the last day of school to each day so like the same think. My conclusion is that is not a good idea my school sould not approve this issue. This like the same think as five-day school week. If they dont add two more hours this maybe can work, but I think this going to be hard for students and teachers. With this system we are not going to conserve energy and resources is going to be the same thing. ",7,6,7,6,7,7,1392,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Enthusiasm is important because is what keeps you doing what you want to accomplish. I strongly agree with the statement of Minister Winston Churchill. I personally think that in life there is always up and downs. For example, when i got bad grades i always think on what am i not doing right so i can fixed it. However, to success in life you have to failure more than once but you have to know that there is going to be obstacles that are going to bring you down but you dont have to let them stop you because you have to think on what you want to accomplish or in what you want to success. If a person losses interest in something they want to, then theyre not going to keeps going. In conclusion, you have to fall so you can get up and keep going to the goal. Loss of enthusiasm can not give you success in life. For example, when you have a goal and there is many obstacles is because your close to get to rich it. However, you can keep doing what you love so you can accomplish the goal that you wanted. Although, there will always be somethimg that try to stop you but you dont have to let stop you.

487,1649,89ADE1CC1BEC,"In my opinion, students should not use their phones in classrooms. The students will get distracted . Also, students should keep away their phones for safety. Lot of students cant stay without cellphones; however, they should know the without phones in classroom they will learn more. First, Students will get distracted if they have their phones in classroom. They will be texting in class, and they will be on social media while the teacher is explaining. Furthermore, some students spend their class time, playing video games, watching movies, or videos on YouTube. It also distract other students that really wants to learn. Sometimes, the teacher allows students to use their phones in classes for educational purpose; however, the students take advantage because they use that time for playing some music on YouTube or taking pictures around the class, so I would not recommend teachers to let them use their phones in classes. I remember the time when I was in 9 grade, I often used my phone in classroom. I thought it would not affect my grades; however, at the end of the semester I saw only D in all of my classes. I stopped using my phone in class, and my grades were getting better. Second, students should keep away their phones in classes for safety. I believe that no one is perfect and there are some students who doesnt have a good behavior in school, so they use their phone for taking inappropriate pictures. In addition, we have seem some examples in other schools about terrorism, and we dont know what students do outside or what kind of friends they have out of school, so the student inside of school may be stay in contact with terrorist outside of the school in case of any terrorist attack. The teacher will be thinking that his or her students are reading about the topic in the class, but the true would be that students are using their phone in a different purpose. The Department of Education should establish a law about not allow students to use their phones in classroom or not use it at all in schools because they wont be able to pay attention, and because is a good way to keep safety in the school. Some may say, students need their phones in class for search information or call for any emergency; however, students dont need their phone when the school provides computers for searching any information, and they dont need their phone for emergency because the school provides police officers and good strategies to protect them in case of any emergency.

What i mean by this is that the older student will help the student on math, language arts, and science which the older student already took. The older kid already knows the concepts of the subjects that the younger student is taking, which means he will teach him the concepts. This means that the younger student would already know the concepts of the three subjects that the older student taught him which is science, language arts, and math. The older student can prepare the younger student for the future. The older student can teach what he is learning to the younger student. For example, the older student can teach the concepts of algebra which the younger student is taking next year. The young student might even study algebra with the older student. The older student can teach other subjects like physical science, and civics economics which the young student could be ready for.

495,76,81B7A7CB8829,"A man named Albert Schweitzer once said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". In this case setting an example by your own behavior is the best way to influence others. For example, younger people look up to those who have struggled like they have and whom came from broke down homes and had succeeded through out their way. People are also influenced by those who have been into sports and who started in the struggle just like theyve had, who later became the best. Showing good actions lead people to persuing you and your examples, which later leads them to the right path. When Albert speaks of an example influencing others many ideas come to mind, one of which was how people who grew up in broke homes and succeeded with their life have had a huge affect on the youth. These people who are known for their success have gone through struggle and hard bottom rock moments. Although through out their journey people may have put them down, they still try their best in being a good example for others and the generation after them. People like this have gone to school and have worked hard in getting good grades to persue what they wanted to major in. They have gone through many obsticules to do what they love and see potential in. Leaders like these have worked their best to do what they want, which leads to having an amazing job with a great career. Although many people look up to those who came from rock bottom, they also look up to those who are well known for their athleticism. As we may know football, basketball, wrestlers, soccer, ect. are sports that are well heard of through out different countries. These sports have not just helped people out with their physical apperiances but have also helped them out mentaly. For example, for those who have started from not knowing the sport and who were told that they werent good enough didnt just give up because they were told so, instead it pushed them into getting better. For those who have tried the sport know that when you join a team you later find love for the sport and want to get better. Well known players have trained and worked hard everyday to be where they are today. Theyve taken risk and tried their best in their games or matches, theyve given their all to be noticed by college coaches, or even scouts. However, both doing great in school and being a great athlete have been known for being a example in influencing others. These two however different but very similar examples both persuade others in; working hard and trying their best. They influence people that you have to never give up in what you believe in or in what you hope to persue in life. They make you mentaly stronger and challange you in becoming the person who you soon hope to be.

Thats why Im agree with Ralph Waldo Emerson, we live in a world the people dont like when you are yourself and they like when you are someone else; I dont think the accomplishment is just for be someone else and not yourself, if you try hard when you are yourself you will have the greatest accomplisment in life and for people who dont belived in their self like: Family, company, manager,people, and you; If you belived in yourself everthing will be good and the accomplishment would be often.",5,6,5,4,5,6,3609,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 4, vocabulary 5, syntax 6, cohesion 5"

It gives a perspective of how you are in your life because it shows the type of person you are, if you are irresponsible person or a bad person, and the manner of take the problems that came forward in your life. For example, if you have a job and you are constantly absent for work, it gives a bad impression because it demonstrate you are irresponsible, and the people can think bad things about you. Demonstrate how your personality is because it shows how you can be with the people and demonstrate how you really are. For example, if you are honest and kindness with the people, they can trust you and have possitive thoughts about you. Shows your live conditions because it demonstrate if you have personal cleanliness, if you care of your self etc. For example, if you go for a interview for apply in a job, and you not take a bath everyday, they would have a bad impression of you and maybe they not accept you in the job, and that led to the people bad comments about you.

499,2201,CBFEE0C81C5E,"Its not a good idea for students to identiify a career by the time they enter high school. The three reasons are because it can cause to much stress on the student, they wont be able to focus on their school work, and it can unmotavite them to succesed in their careeer. If the student is expected to identify a career by highschool it can affect how their doing in school becuse all they will be thinking about is a career to pick. They wont focus on their work in class or pay attention in class which will make them fail and slump the class. That can unmotavite them and they can stop showing to school and drop out. Those are my reasons on why I think making a student choose a career by highschool is bad. Others might argue that a student who has a career in mind by the time they enter highschool will succesed because they know what they want to do in life. It will guide them to success in the future, they will have all highschool to study about their career they chose. However, that might work on some students but it wont work on all bacause not everyone knows what they wanna be in life. Some drop out of school cause of the stress it puts on them and just start working to make money.

500,933,DCDDFA12E124,"We humans arent really perfect, there hasnt been one human that has never made a mistake, for example the person that is writing this prompt, has had a decent amount of failures in his life. One time he was taking a really hard test like this one, but he didnt know that it was going to decide if he is going to attend college or not, so he just sat down on the chair in Generic_School Library and he began to take the test, he had to take another year of high school, but he figured that he doesnt want to fail this senior year. If he fails again he has to graduate with a bunch of kids, that doesnt sound right, does it? im from a family that always want their kids to be a doctor or an engineer, and they want to show to other parents that ""my child is better than yours"". So they kept putting pressure on me for months and years but it didnt seem to help a lot, but I had to make a change one day not because I was trying to make my parents happy or impress the other parents, but I was tired, I was tried of not having respect in the family, like anything that i said didnt mean anything to them, so I had to change, and with that change came a lot of consequences, for example losing my friends, not leaving the house as much as I used to, working less so it means less money on my paycheck by the end or every two weeks, but i didnt care as much, because I knew that this is going to be my last year at Generic_School. I will learn from my defeats, and make sure that they wouldnt happen again, like one time I was working at Panera, my main job, and it was still my training week so I had no clue what the names for the dressing and the food was, so there is this computer above every line that tells you what the name of the food is, and it tells you all of the ingredients in the food and what kind of dressing that salad or what kind of sauce that food needs, so I followed the ingredients on the computer but i had made a peanut butter and jelly sandwich before the order i was making, and the costumer was allergic to peanut butter but i didnt know that so i made their salad with the gloves that was contacted with the peanut, so I gave the salad to my friend to bag it and he asked me ""Hey Generic_Name! did u make sure to change your gloved after each order?"" and I said ""Im sorry, I didnt know that i have to change my gloves every time."" he said ""Its fine, just change your gloves and make another salad."" after that i have always changed my gloves after every order. By the way my side job is detailing cars at all in one auto group located in Generic_City, VA. Its not a really easy job, but the pay is good, $50/hour, for a teenager thats a really good amount of money and imagine me working every day for a year and working 5 hours every day, yea, that is a lot of money for someone like me, last year i bought a lot of stuff with the money i made, I bought a car, a new phone, a really expensive watch, and a bunch of other stuff that u get when u have a lot of money, they dont affect your life, but they are just there, for entertainment purposes, like who really needs to have a Nintendo switch and a ps4 at the same time, like what type normal person would do that, you only do this type of stuff when you have too much money, and having too much money and not knowing what to do with it is insane. Me failing makes me stronger, its like you are running a marathon but every time you fall u get faster and faster, you keep getting closer to the finish line, and that is a good thing, the finish line is where we all are going to end up, but it depends what u do during this race that decides if you are going to win or not, if you keep failing and failing and not learning from it then I feel bad for you, but you have to focus and learn and decide what is good and what is not good for you, you should not be distracted by the stuff around you and your life. humans are stronger that what they think, i read somewhere that humans only use %1 of their brain capacity, imagine the day that we all would use at least %50 of it. If you ever feel like u have be defeated in life, you are not correct, get back on your feet and started working hard again, there no way that you would do something the right way and not get a good result out of it, its impossible to do so, unless you are pretending that you are doing it, in fact that used to be me last year, pretending like im doing homework, pretending like im listening to the teacher, but where did i go with all of that, just because I was lazy and didnt want to pay attention, I lost the race, but I got back on my feet this year, and im making sure that im happy, more than anyone else, Im not going to let any negativity impact my life. My dad used to tell me, he still does, but he says that ""imagine you are a racing horse and you have covers on your eyes, so you would only see in front of you"", apparently it makes the horse focus on the race but he said that ""you have a lot of distractions on your way but focus on what you have to do and only that, nothing else. just keep running and dont let the distractions affect your life, if they do you will lose balance and either affect someone else or you are the only one that will fall over, and that is not a good thing."" In general just focus on your life have fun at times but make sure it doesnt affect anything and if it does, make sure that you, with the help of someone else or by yourself can figure out a way to resolve the situation, sometimes its a really good option to get help from the people that you know, like for example friends and family or even the school counselor or the principal, just get some help if you think that you cant resolve it by yourself. so the former British prime minister called ""Winston Churchill"" is right about ""success consists of going from failure without loss of enthusiasm.""

People should considere setting their aim low so that they can star by reviewing the stuff that needs to be fixed,those are going to the things that are going to make you stronger and capable to lots of stuff. The people that start the lowest are the ones that overcome their dreams,the ones that are capable,the ones that set their aims low and achieve a mark. People overcome themselfs because of the mistakes that some people make along the way are the ones that help by building their character and makes themslef in a way stronger and more capable of lots of more stuff out there.

For example a person that saids thats going to do lots of things riskign everything he or she may have a by just taking a single step loses it bacause of not being able to a list think before doing anything,by starting low can help not putting things and not taking any risk,by taking stuff step by step and learning things along the path.

My oppinion is that people should considere think before doing anything because that what helps getting you on the top and not just let anything fall down in front of your face,by thinking that to risk thing and not having to even think about it for a second was going to get you to the top,and if your going to chalenge yourself make sure to think about it stuff before doing it.",7,6,4,5,4,5,3083,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 5, vocabulary 4, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

503,3798,01501F95B8B2,"10pm curfews is a bad idea, why? Because teens lives would be affected in many different ways, including the fact that in can get them in much more trouble. Teens would have to adjust to this rule and some might not even know about the rule when it comes out. I think that teens should not get an early curfew but instead change it to a later time, so teens dont have to go through having to deal with changing there hole life around. having a law like this can get teens in more trouble because now they have an extra law that can be broken easily with out even knowing. teens enjoy being out late and doing things, it can make them feel older and more grown up like. Teens are stuck in school seven hours a day and it can take a good bit of there day away so having that option to stay out later and being able to do things is a great option for them. Lots of teens want to go shopping and hang out with friends at a mall, but school and homework can take a while so they cant do it during the day always. for example, a friend and me wanted to go to the movies after school but we got assigned lots of home work and we new we would be busy the next days, so in order to be able to watch the movie, we would have to go at night time. curfews can inter fear with couples who want to do something later in the night, and it would be unfair to the teens to have to go back home just because they cant stay out late. Having said all this, teens are old enough that they can make there own decisions. Lots of tees have after school jobs taking them late into the night, and a lot of them need to be able to walk home. Teens would have to start having to start to work around the new law and make changes to there work hours. Also kids would start getting less work hours resulting in the not getting enough money, some house hold have teens helping pay bills. Curfews laws are and will be the most common law being broken resulting in an increase of crime. teens do not like it when they get told how long they get to stay out, which will result in them just braking the law. I would be surprised if teens would start getting in less trouble, because teens will still do what they want even if you set a curfew. A curfew only tells a teen that your not suppose to be outside, but that still does not mean that they will do it. Teens are going to do what they want at the end of the day and not what the law tells them to. The best way to make sure teens can stay on track but the still to be a curfew is that the curfew should be moved up to 12pm. Also teens enjoy going to gas station at night to get stuff and lots of the enjoy the walk as well. In conclusion I think that if we just move the curfew up to 12pm it would allow teens to have a good night out with out having to worry about being out to late. Also showing that kids can get in more trouble by having an early curfew just means that its a bad idea and should not be implemented. If adults could just put more trust in teens i think it would improve kids behavior and also have kids get to prove them self to show how responsible they can be. teens are more responsible than everyone might think, I think they just need a chance to prove it to everyone. I think earlier curfews are a bad idea and that it should just be moved up a little for that will help teens out in the long shot.",6,8,6,8,7,6,18,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 6"

Schools should limit on how much extracurricular activities they can do, having too much will cause confusion among students in class and too much is always not good. having their families decide for them is an option, but the best decision should be for the school, for they know how well the student is doing. Research from age between 21 to 26 shows that 95% of them wanted to decide for their children,They wanted the best for them and the best they will do, That is the job of the parents. A blog back in 2006 shows that people who decides for their children most likely to get a job than people who decide on their own. A Research conducted back in 2010 shows that 80% of people prefer to decide for themselves, having them to decide will greatly benefit their mind and shows that they are responsible on how they act. They like to choose their own path and find their own talent. Finding their own talent shows responsibility, and having responsibilities at a young age takes courage, dedication, and hard work. Having too many activities will also cause a lot of their energy to get drained, they wont have any energy to spare for other activities like cooking for dinner, or doing assignments. The school should keep track on every students activities, This ensure their safety and heath. Having every energy drained from your body is bad, and the school should keep track at their time as well. Having more energy will greatly benefit their health. The school is partly responsible for the students, but the parents are most responsible and should know what their childrens are doing, if they think their doing too much, they should talk to them and have a simple chat about overworking. The school can also add a one simple rule where people who has 3 activities or more should be given time at the end of each classes 15 to 30 minutes free time to discuss with their teacher on how well they are doing and to do missing work or assignments.

Research from this school shows that students have increased their grades when they added this rule back in 1996, it increased from the average of 3.0 GPA to 4.1 GPA, This huge increase shows that adding this simple rule will benefit not only the students health, but their grades as well.

Although,I do disagree with character traits with influences us that help improve our trait that can help us set right path. Everyone has their own unique traits. Some people has traits like kindness,honesty,caring,and more. Unfourtely that some character traits cant be chose but sometime character traits chose you as your character traits .For example my character traits is pretty weird: kind honesty,helpful,caring,little crazy and lastly trickery like the fox. Same with parents has their own unique character traits;however, parents character traits can be passed down to children base on their character traits and if they are worthy of the carry their parents traits. For example,It remind me the time when I am all dressed up and got my hair done after that I look at the mirror; I notice that I look familiar at the time I realized that I look like mom. As poof that I do have my moms gene meaning I have her physical look. As i explain even character trait and be passed down or chose have own character traits. Next, everyone has their own spirit animal that is represent your character traits. For example if the person has the character trait which is playful,love water,caring,and fun loving as poof of this person character traits show their spirit animal is dolphin. Therefore, anyone can chose their character trait that is best suit for them. It is unique for people and important having spirit animal and character traits to help them balance it out and chose what character trait that best represent him or her. Which allow the person to identify what spirit animal is and identify which character trait the animal is. For insist,White tiger know for protect their pup like any mother would do as the same trait as our mom has show. Choosing character trait could be tricky for everyone but it is important to be wise which character trait is best for you. You can choose which character traits,sometime it can lead to having great friend or loving family. But their will be a price to pay like if you are kind then someone will take avenge of you in order to trick or frame you. My opinion is to be strong and persist or sass but your pick add them long with your chosen character trait. Character traits can be blessing in disguise and curse. As you see chosing your own character trait is better then someone influences you; it only cause problem and change you then your real self. Although, I explain my reason:everyone has there own unique trait ,animal,lastly the price of choosing character trait.

I think this is better because some students bring cell phones to school and they use them during class and they dont pay attention to the teacher and they are always distract when they have cell phones, some students dont pay attention because they are using cell phones in class and when the teacher ask them a question they dont know what to answer because they didnt pay attention when the teacher was talking. Another thing is that some students are now getting in trouble because they are using cell phones talking to other people that they dont really know and they give that person information about them and about school and they dont really know who that person is and they could be in danger because that person knows everything about them and about the school. Sometimes students have their cell phones turn on during class and when the teacher is talking the phone begins to sound like someone calling or a message and they interrupted the teacher and the teacher have to take time from the lesson and tell the student to turn on the cell phone or to give it to her.

511,1761,D5588B5DD6FF,"Once The great artist Michelangelo said that ""The grater danger for most of us lies not only setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark"". I personally disagree with this because not all of us people really wants to more than what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Some people may say that this may agree with Michelangelos said, because sometimes getting out of our comfort zone it is what most of us should do; challenge our selves to get even higher expectation and results, but to be realistic not all of us aims for that. First of all, most of us do not really wants to do more than it is asked to do. For example, Generic_Name a orange contractor, he has been asked from his boss to fill 10 trailers of orange per day, one day he filled 12 trailers of oranges and thought that his boss would pay him the 2 trailers extra of orange that Generic_Name and his worker filled, in his paycheck did not appear the 2 extra trailers of orange causing Generic_Name pay his workers for the extra hours and work that they had putted, Generic_Name never again did more of he was asked to do. People took Generic_Name as en example of not doing more of what it is asked to do in their jobs. Secondly, what really matters in this life is to achieve your goal. For example Generic_Name is a student from Generic_School, Generic_Name and his friends in their freshman year aimed for the advanced diploma in his school, but Generic_Name aimed for the standard diploma, his friends bought that by choosing the advanced diploma would be easier to earn credits and graduate faster, but little did they know they would get challenging classes, having almost AP classes in almost every material, Generic_Name from the other side having his standard diploma resulted him having normal classes and passing almost all of them. At their junior year Generic_Names friends decided to change their diplomas because their classes was so difficult that their credits was not high enough, Generic_Name had the needed credits to be considered a graduate. Sometimes it is better to achieve your goal and do not try to get out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself because at the end what really matter in this life it is to achieve your goal. Lastly, aiming low is a representation of honesty, and humility. For example, Generic_Name have a Mexican restaurant, she does not aspire her restaurant to be the greatest in her town, but what she really aspires for her restaurant is to keep her with the same love and passion she has for cooking and the satisfaction of her clients. Aiming low does not mean that is going to be a failure, but if you do it with honesty and humility, the danger will not be as big as it appears. As you can see, Michelangelos said its not all the way truth because, people from all over the world thinks differently, having different experiences in their lives causing them to disagree on his said. Not all the people wants to more what it is asked to do, what really matter in this world it is to achieve your goal, and aiming low is a representation of honesty and humility. Not always setting our aim too high and falling short it is what it means to survive in this world.",8,7,9,7,6,8,2970,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

A positive attitude is really important when you are trying to be successful, is sometimes what motivates you to keep going and achieve your goals. However, just having a positive attitude is not going to make you a successful person. To reach the success in life you need to be proactive, you need to believe in yourself, work as hard as you can, and do what you love because your soul and hearth is what guide you during your life. When you look at the big Hollywood stars, or the players in the NFL, you can see that they successes in life, making millions of dollars and doing what they love.

515,2010,DB69B98973B6,"One topic that is frequently debated today is if schools should be allowed to control students involvement in extracurricular activities. They think that sometimes students take too many extracurricular activities to the point that they do not have enough time to do their school work. They feel that extracurricular activities dont help students manage their time wisely. I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them. Firstly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to manage their time. It helps students learn how to manage their time by making them make a schedule. By making a schedule students learn how hard it is to an adult. Students make resposible actions and learn how much work they have to put in for them to be good in school. Extracurricular activities doesnt always take studenst time but prepares them for life Secondly extracurricular activities helps students learn how to make new friends. Extracurricular activities helps students how to communicate and make new friends while making good memories. Students shouldnt always be focused in school I believe that students should also have fun and friends. Friends will make school and other school related activities enjoyable for kids and teengers. Lastly extracurricular activities helps students make colleges be interested in them. Colleges get interested in you when they see all of the thinggs youve done althrought high school. If colleges see that youve a lot throught high school they would be even more interested in you. Colleges also check your grades and other stuff but the thing they check the most is extracurricular activities because they want to see if you were consistant. As you have read I believe the decision regarding extracurricular activities should be left to the students because it helps students learn how to manage their time, make new friends, and it helps students make colleges be interested in them.

516,925,D7B9BEAEE50E,"Dear ; Mr principal i have done some resarch, and i think that its a good idea to change the school cafeteria menu, to a more healthier food. I know that it wil be a big change, but it will help the students alot here in school, i have some reasons of why you must change the school menu and how it will help us. The first reason is because the parents of the students wont have to be worry anymore of what thier children are eating in school, you know that there are some parents that want thier children to eat healthier, and if we change the menu they wont be worry all the time, because they will know that thier children are eating healthy food, every single day they wont be eating junk food. My second reason is that the student will be heathy, and strong, they will also be more active, and ready to learn at school they wont be sleeping that much, and they wont be so lazy, because what the student are eating right now in school that is junk food it will make them, less active and their brain wont function good though the whole day. Thats why you should consider to change the school menu do it for the children that goes to school so they can be healthy and learn new things every single day. My last reason, is that the student wont be geting sick alot, and they will coming to school more often, they wont be missing alot of school day beause of the healthy food that they will be eating from our school every day, we will also be helping their parents because when their children get sick they spend alot of money for doctor and medicine, but since we will be giving healthy food to the children they wont be geting sick alot. and we will be teaching them the importance of eating healthy food and being healthier. This are my reason of why you should change the school menu so please consider this idea because we will be alot more healthier then what we are right now and our brain will functon good, and it will help us for the rest of our life, because in school is were we spend must of our time and we learn everything here, its like our second home do this for our future and for the good of the school.

518,3857,80C2ED8BE6A6,"Online school can be more beneficial to a lot of students struggling with grades and being late to school because of over sleeping or missing the bus. Going to school takes up a lot of time off stuff youre interested in doing outside of school like playing sports and spending more time at home. I agree with online classes over going to school because some students feel more comfortable learning in their house rather then going to school. Some students also have trouble with over sleeping due to a lack of sleep causing them to miss the bus and be late to class. Online school starts in a more reasonable time of day so its more convenient for those that over sleep to attend class on time. This allows students to have more energy which will help them focus on their work and be more productive in class. When students get sick they miss days off school which causes them to be behind on class work, for some students being be hide on class work causes stress because their grades go down. But you can still attend online class if youre sick. You can also attend online classes while on vacation with a laptop youll rarely have missing work to do which is a big positive for improving your grades. However, some may argue that looking at the bright screen for a extended amount of time will put a strain on your eyes. Also that its easier to cheat on tests and quizs in online classes then it is to cheat in school, because the teacher dosent know what your doing on.

519,1890,D4269468970A,I agree with honesty because its good to be honest and make people trust you and believe in you and because you have honesty it will get you friends and teachers will like you as a student. And also it is respectful to be honest and if its your friend or family I think you should be honest because its your friend and they probably wouldnt care what you say if its mean because they probably know that you dont mean to be mean and that your just being honest with them. But being honest is also not good because it can hurt someones feelings and can make them sad and not being honest could make you lose a friend and or make your friend happy. And if your not being honest and the person finds out you could lose them as a friend or they will dislike you a little bit. But if i could choose both I would because it depends on the situation on why you have to be honest being honest or not honest could make someones feel sad or happy. And being honest or not could make someones day and make things better for them. In conclusion:I say it would depend on the situation on why you have to be honest or not so that is what I think if you should be honest or not. But you have to be careful on what you say with honesty or not because depending on what you say it could be a big situation for you if you say something wrong.,6,4,6,6,6,6,2953,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 6"

Theres a lot of ways you can stay active and not be board out of your mined, for example; over the summer my Dad took me to work with him, as a carpenter. But not every one can do that, therefore heres some ideas for you: go to a gym, go for walks ,or get a job. Going to the gym might be a big comment, but its very healthy physically and mentally, youll start feeling good about your self, maybe even start looking good too. this is my first idea in how to stop being idle.

Walking was something that helped me fined my peace, just walking around admiring the world, breathing in the fresh air; now im not saying to do it alone maybe with a friend or two, or maybe walk your dog. pretty must enjoy the beautiful world that gods given us.

522,964,FFA6690BC309,"Having activities after school are good ideas for students so they would spend the time doing good things and not thinking in make bad decisions and we do not need more bad people in this world we need more good people to succes in this world. Although some people think that schools should control the students involvement in extracurricular activities nevertheless, the students should decide if the student wants to do extra activities after school because students would have the freedom to decide and some students needs that time to study or to work. First, students need to have the freedom to decide if they want to do actives after school for example some students work after school sometimes they need that time to make money to help their parents to pay bills like rent or water. If the students have activities after school they would not be able to help their parents. Also some students need to take care of their family members like their brothers, sister or cousins. If the students do not help to take care of their family members their parents would have to pay somebody else and that would mean spend more money for them. The students who work are also learning more skills so in the future they would not be lazy and they are learning how an adult life is that is not to easy but they would be lucky because they would have learned that when they were younger. Also sometimes parents decide for the students to do an activity that they not even like which it means that the students would not be happy and they would have a lot of stress is better that if they want to do an activities they should decide what they want to do not be a parents decision. Second, students need this time after school to do homework or to study. For example if the students have activities after school they would be late at home and they would be tired which it means that they would not study or do their homework so they would get bad grades and if they try to do their schools homework they would stay up late which it means that they would not get enough of sleep so they would be sleeping and lazy at class the next day. Also students need this time to take a break from the school and relax students schools life if hard sometimes they need a break from everything to came back with more energies. Having enough time to study would help the students to improve their skills at school so in the future they would have more opportunities to find a good job that they would enjoy and they make money to have a decent life and support when they have a family. This shows that students should decide if they want to do extra activities after school because students can have the freedom to decide and the if the students have activities after school they would not have time to study or to do their homework. In my conclusion the life of a student is not easy they need to know how to manage their time so they can go to work or study sometimes they also have things to do at their house taking care of their family members. Students needs to choose if they have extra energy to do activities after school. Students would have a lot of time in the summer vacations so they can decide if they want to do and activities they would know how to manage their time to work and take care of their families member but they would be also enjoying their time doing activities.

I have three main reasons why i agree Author Emerson,and the first reason is to get better at what you are doing you have to take bigger steps. In order for me to get better at football and soccer, i have to try to do something beyond what i used to do. I take personal Fitness in school and my goal is to get stronger, but i cannot get stronger if i keep on lifting the same weights i can not i get stronger if am always benching the same weight.

It is just like Uber competing with lyft, they both good at what they do but in order for uber to gain more customers they have to try to do something that is beyond what they have mastered.

Also, Trump had everything he wanted cars,money, houses but still wanted to compete with Clinton for the presidency. Lets use an iphone for instance,the more they keep on upgrading it the more they gain more customers. A lot of successful entrepreneurs took bigger steps by getting a loan to start their business.

Its hard for some students to learn a class that it have been given to him/her. Some students are born with special skills, they can handle many things at the time but not all the teenagers and the kids have the same ability. People should think more about just giving students classes without consulting with them about what their class are going to be. Some student might not have the skills that are needed to take the class that it has been given or the student might struggle with the class that it has received, because they didnt had the chance to tell their teachers or parents what they were capable of. However, students should be allow to elect a class they feel more comfortable of in their school, and all the schools should be aware of letting students pick the classes or activities that they want to do or they want to learn more about, because It has been proved by scientists and experts, that the ninety-five percent of the majority of the students who elect their classes have become successful in their education path because, students have developed different types of skills that are based in a careers that they want to do in their future, that it became easy for them to manage after all the experience they have gotten, after choosing something they liked while being in school. The majority of students do not consider music or drama classes important for their education, its something that you are inspired by to do. Music, art, and drama these classes can be a distraction for students not to focus in their school work and it might affect their education status. Most of the students from the age of ten years and up are still developing their brains and they can get easily distracted. Most of the parents in the U.S they wont let their kids watch TV for more than thirty minutes, because they can create a habit and they will spend more of their time watching TV, playing video games and more. In addition, for those students who are forced to take art or drama classes etc, this choices can lead teenagers or kids to fall into a level of depression, for not having the chance pick something they like to do in school. Parents and school teachers should let students know that they can also practice any sport in school, this method would keep students exercise and healthy. Overall, students should have the last word of what they want to learn in school and parents should be aware of that.

All this happened after my parents gave me the opportunity to decided what it was good for me and my future.

527,1088,2286BCFF86EB,"Generic_Name was sitting in the cafeteria listening to music refusing to touch her plate of food, why was she like that? Well, she was worried that everyone had their specific career picked out before going to high school and she was the only one that didnt. Students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will feel pressured at a young age and students will change their career options as they take different courses. First, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will feel pressured at a young age. For example, my friend Generic_Name wanted to become an astronomer but her parents wanted her to be an engineer, she felt pressured and didnt know what courses to take. During class time Generic_Names teacher gave everyone in the class a paper to write the possible classes they wanted to take their first year of high school, but unfortunately Generic_Name didnt know what classes to take. While Generic_Name was still thinking her teacher approached to her and told her that both science and math courses connected to the careers she was debating to become, she also told her that after taking those classes she was gonna be able to pick the class she favored the most and go for that one. Some people believe that committing to a career at a young age will help students develop and make them smarter but they are incorrect because committing at a young age will cause students to have a lot of stress and give them less opportunities to join other classes. Second, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because students will change their career options as they take different courses. For example, Generic_Name was looking forward to become a professional soccer player but he knew he had a 20% chance of becoming one. One day during class time Generic_Name started to think about a serious career that he can actually accomplish and put extra time and work. He decided to become a history teacher; He enjoyed learning history so much that he thought about becoming the one to teach others history as well. Generic_Name was so pleased with his choice that he payed close attention on everything Generic_Name said and never hesitated to raise his hand and ask for more questions. Generic_Name took all the history classes he needed to take, he also joined debate class and a public speaking class therefore he would become better at public speaking and not be afraid to talk in front of others. A month later Generic_Name thought about how good hell be if he became an attorney. Generic_Name definitely knew how to speak in front of others after taking the public speaking class and he also knew how to defend a case so he changed his career option and decided to stick with attorney. Another example is that Generic_Name wanted to be a dog sitter but she was also interesting in the study of the human body and how it worked, so she decided to join a a psychology class and learn more about it. In conclusion, students are not expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school because they will get a chance to pick the career they want as they take different courses in high school and it will also cause many students to feel pressured at such a young age. Students should know that they have all the time they need to learn and be curious about any class they put their interest into, as they grow up their brain will develop therefore they will become more smarter and they will have the chance to pick the career to want to be in.

529,1517,6305A432AB38,"The Benefits of Having A Good Attitude. It has been said that a positive attitude is the key to success in life.

The attitude with which people face problems, shows the effort and how much people try. A positive attitude make things easier for people to be successful in life. Many people may argue that a positive attitude is not the key to success in life because people does not always need to be positive to become successful. For example, there is many people who became successful without the needing of a good attitude to do things. This argument has a point, since people does not always have to be positive when facing something. However a positive attitude will help everything to go well. For example, people who have a positive attitude in life will attract good things, and everything will go well. Even though many people may argue that people does not always need to be positive, a positive attitude will help to make everything go well in life. To summarize, it has been said that with a positive attitude people become successful in life because a positive attitude help not to give up, and a positive attitude will make things easier to go through. People with a good attitude do not give up when facing problems. Having a good attitude, will make things easier to go through.

530,3796,FCC2991C1760,"Kahoot is one of the best educational activitys for teachers to use in school and for kids to learn with. Because when ever kids are using kahoot they work together to get the right answers,kids enjoy using kahoot to learn better then using paper and books because kids get really bored of using paper and books,Paper and books are also boring for teachers to grade too. But , Kahoot keeps the kids more active when they are learning and gives the teacher better controll of the kids. Also,kahoot is easy to teach with because when kids use paper and books the teacher has to go to the kids one by one just to correct their mistakes but when the teachers are using kahoot they can explain the right answer faster and better in front of the whole class. Teachers who use papers and books are always tried because they have to grade them, one by one and cant go home untill their done and teachers somtimes get really lazy. But, when teachers are using kahoot to teach it easy to see who did it and who did not do it and they do not get so tried and when the teachers are not tried they can teach better . And when kids use kahoot they talk to each other and when kids talk to each other and work together they do a great job and nobody is left out or bullied.

533,3409,A8BB150F53AB,"In my oppion, I think technologly is good for the world! Because you can comunicate with people that are far away. Even its a great way to help you with school like homework, studying and learning also it makes teachers life easier. And I think people would get lost around the world if teachnologly wasnt made. Because GPS helps you to get to your destenation safely also it tells you where you at. Teachnologly is probably the best thing people will carry around them because all your messages, calls and emails comes threw your phone. When I got my first video game, I started playing it 24/7 because I use to play it with my friends during summer break. But one day I knew video games wasnt going to be a big thing anymore so I asked my parents if I could get a phone and they said "" yes I will buy it to you if you bring me good grades the next marking period"". When I got my first phone I started using it to text friends and being in soical media and I know that wasnt going to get me anywhere in life. But one day I thought to myself what if technologly can help you with everything like now adays? Because my computer helps me with homeworks and projects and I can turn it in on time. Although, some people think technologly is bad because it keeps you out from playing sports, going out with your friends and communicating with people! Some people dont buy their childrens a phone because they want them to work for it, but some parents arent like that. People be going on soical media putting there own life at risk, thats why some parents dont let their own child have technologly. Also because people be using it all the time and they dont care whats happens around them. Like my parents didnt want me to have technologly when I was little because he wanted me to open to the world. But I was shy to talk to new people that I didnt even know, I started to be helpful and friendly to everyone because I knew some people didnt have the samething as me. Because some countries are really poor and they dont have money to eat and they cant help out their children with their eduaction. In fact, I think technologly is always going to be helpful where ever you go, because if you go somewhere that people dont speak your language youll have your phone on you and you can research there language and it will tell you. I really will not know if technologly was not made because it helps everyone in the world right now. It helps me pay my payments and learn online. So I think technologly is a good way to help you with things and to communicate with people that dont live with you.

534,122,F52394B3500C,"I think that school should not follow the business model. Adding two more hours to the schedule is not worth it for example some student need that time to other activities like go to the gym or play any sport and by adding two more hours that means that they are not going to be able to do all kinds of activities after they get out of school. There are some student whom work after they get out from school, they need that time to go work and make their money and having to stay on school two more hours means that are not going to have the same time as before to work also means that they are going to make less money. Staying on school two more hours will be a difficult task like myself I need go home after I am done with school because I have to take care of my house like make my sister food and clean my house I have to do that every day after I get out from 0school that is why it will be difficult task to do for me to stay two more hours on school. I think that adding two more hours to the schedule and only having to go to school for four days only is not good idea sure we want to save energy as well but school can not afford to follow the businesses model. For example student can not afford to stay on school for 10 straight hours they are going be really tired and by being like that they might do their work wrong. Also those student whom work after school if they stay two more hours I think that they are going to be really tired for work I have some friends they start working at 5pm they get out of 3pm that means that they will have time to rest for two hours but if they have two stay on school for two more hours that means that they will get out of school at 5pm so they are not going to have time rest an just have to go straight to work. Another disadvantage of getting two more hours of school is that for those students whom works and get homework that means that they will not have time to do their homework for example myself I have to go home early to take care of my house I have to care of my house quickly so I can start doing my homework so staying two more hours on school for me it will be difficult to do all of that task after I get out from school. Of course there are some benefits from adding two more hours to the school schedule like saving resources and saving energy also those student whom does not do anything after school can learn more because they can concentrate more they does no to worry about what they are going to do after school. There are some student whom does not do anything after they get out from school so for them it does not really matter whether they have o stay two more hours or they does not have to stay like my friend Generic_Name he is a student who does not do any actives or their go to work after school so for him it does not matter if have to stay two more hours. Having two more hours means that those student whom does not do anything after school can have more time con do their school work as well study more for their test. The benefit of adding two more hours only benefits those who does not do anything after school. In conclusion trying to follow the businesses model is not good idea for our school, so many student are going to arguing for it they are going be saying that just by trying to save a little bit of energy and resources they have to change so many things and sacrifice their money and their time in fact is not a big different adding two more hours two the schedule every day because that means that we till have to use energy in those hours.",7,7,6,7,6,6,3642,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
535,1562,1B622A28EDD9,"Do you think students would benefit from being able to attend classes from home than at school? I believe taking classes online at home could be very benificial, because you wouldnt have to worry about getting distracted by other students like you would at school. Youd be able to advance at your own pace, meaning you wont have to rush at everything. Lastly, you wouldnt have to be so stressed from all the homework you get from each teacher in each class, but everything has its disadvantages as well. Id like to start by saying that not being distracted from your class is great, most students get easily distracted by others. Anything that makes you lose your focus during class is considered a distraction, which includes even cellphones. If you dont pay attention to class your most likely going to end up getting lost and fail, but when your at home doing your work online by yourself you wouldnt have to worry about this. Another benefit from being able to attend class at home, would by that you can move at your own pace. This is a big benefit, for example at school I have to follow the teachers pace and sometimes when the teacher moves to fast on a subject I end up confused and lost making me fail the test or not doing good on the homework. At home you could take your time to process and understand the subject before moving on to a different one. Helping you do a lot better. My final reason would be less stress. I say this because Im stressing right now to keep up my good grades. I get to much homework and most of the times I dont get time to do it because of work or family. Im the oldest at home and I have to take care of my siblings, which means having to make food for them, clean up the house making sure everyones ok. Making me not do homwork after school. Most of the times I have to stay up late doing homework. I wouldnt have to worry about this if I did everything online making me less stressed. I have given you three reasons on how doing your classes online can be benificial, but there are also some disadvantages. One of them could be not interacting with other students. I know that earlier I had said others can become a distraction but thats during class after class its nice talking to others, everything has its time and place. Another disadvantage could be that you may need help with something and you wont be able to have someone to help. At school we have our teachers and when your stuck with something they can help you by explaining it in other words to make it sound more simple. So, there our benefits on having class online but also disavantages. I end this essay by saying that I still believe taking online classes at home can benefit you a lot, But everyone has there own way of learning. If your more of a independant person than I would recommend taking online classes but if your more of a social person than stay in school. All that matters is that you pass your class.",8,7,9,8,7,7,360,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

537,3810,5DA3135B6664,"Ralph Waldo, Emerson, wrote ""unless you try to do something beyond hat you already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with Emerson statement these are my reaason why. First, i think if we do not prepare for more than one thing. We never will grow up. Second, have more than one knowledge than other people always will be advantage. Last, if we do not try more than one thing that can be more hard of that we already know. we never will grow. First reason,i think if the people do not prepare their lives with more than one knowledge. Their lives will be without direccion, and with less opportunies in our society, becuase they will do not have the enought knowledge to play a good job. For example, if they are looking to find better job with new experiencies that will be impossible to find for them, becuse they do not have the knowledge which one is require for the position. how they can be productive for the country or society. If they are not prepred to make done specific job that can be important. Second reason, when we have differents knowledge our lives help us a lot to find the best or easy jobs. The knowledge is the most power thing the human being can have in thier hands. Some people think the knowlege is something that we can not buy from any where. Exmple, if you focus to learn. you always will be have advantage to grow. Last, i think if the people never try something hard they never will grow. we always need to try something who will bring new experiences on our lives. Exmple, when someone is goint to university and the person graduated from teacher, but if he stuck there, and not go for more hard profession he never will grow like principal etc. Conclusion, i agree with Emerson statement, because he give to us expecific ideas what is life about when he said ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered , you will never grow. this is why i agree to his statement, and i provide all this reason.

This is the opinion of some educators that think the students dont need a long vacations ,because they cannot retain the learned in the past year, some students think the same .The system to the long long vacation for students in high school can be a very problematic because they are start the adultlife and need time off for live. The idea that the studentss vacations need are more short is bad because the students in high school needs long period of vacation for find their firts job, some students need travel to other country for visit their family and need a long vacations; if the students not have a good long vacations they can stressed and have other nervous problems. For this situation to improve that the vacation are very short is impossible because not all students have a same system to live and some need time to find independitzation, some enjoy with their family and other can study in their homes, in other words the students need explore the world and this only can possible when have time in vacations the rest of the year they can study.

I get the part that said we choose our own character trait because we all now if something worn or not we can choose to the wrong thing or the right thing it up to us at this point for example some ask you what you what to be in the future now it you choose to make even tho you have a choose there is a 50/50 present you will follow the same path as some in your life that influences you. we all are influences by something or someone an example some teen want to be raper because there is someone around their that one or they want to be a basketball player because the know a basketball player they think he or she is cool. if you disagree with me, ask yourself, how did I become who Im today?

542,934,FDFB04ED3388,"I agree with John Lubbock statement about ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it"" because in order for you to get to your career , you want to have very good character traits. For an example , you love working with kids , so you apply working at a daycare center where youll teach little kids the different types of shapes and watch them while their parents are at work. You apply and get schedule for an interview and the owner in charge looks over your resume and realizes you have bad character traits , do you think that theyll give you the job ? no they wont because they want someone who has good character traits. Another reason , Your character shouldnt be decided by the world or your friends. Your character is something you show to somebody like loyalty and respect. If your loyal to someone chances are theyll be loyal to you. For an example a Hospital hires you to be a general surgeon most likely they want you to stay loyal to them and stay with them. Respect goes a long way , respecting someone is very important you never want to get in someones bad side because you never know what theyll do if you disrespect them. You want to always respect someone. Your character is something that is chosen by yourself never the world, because you could be a very good person and youll still have people talking down on you , but you choose to accept the fact that people are always going to have their own opinion. The world shouldnt decided if your a good person or a bad person society shouldnt decide that either. You choose to either be mean , rude , nice , happy , or sad. Your character shouldnt be based on the people around you. They shouldnt have to choose your attitude. Even though people think that your character is formed by influences beyond our control , I think we control our own character , we choose to either to be mean or nice.

By Sharing answers, Help each other if stuck in proplem, and get to finish on Time . First, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because sharing answers helps me learn New thins to learn about new answers to thing about because I,m not that good in English speaking, For example i got Generic_Name, My English 11 Teacher Gives the hole class a paper to Read and answer, By the time i finish reading i ask my tracher if i could let Generic_Name to be my partner so we could help each other and get it done on time by helping each other and share our answer to see a diffrent thoughts of each one of us, Secondley, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, Because Its fun to work with a person or more, For example in History Class, when the teacher got to let us do class work for tomorrow exam or test, she let us do a group of 4 and do a challege in a computer so we could learn and do fun in the same time. Third, Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone. Because Students could finish their work on time, Foe Example Last week me and Generic_Name we got a project is Due in two day in History class, We worked together and reachers a diffrent thing and write a diffrents thought and even diffrent answers and we compond all of our answers and finish on time with diffrents thoughts. Conclution, Some people may say Working with a group is more Benefit than working all alone, But Sometime i like to work a lone because i could think of my answers and question and even could get my own grade but sometimes when i work in a group when i try to work and care about my work but the rest of my grop does not care so if no body has worked then the hole group will get a zero even the person who worked.",7,5,6,6,5,4,522,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 7"

The beneficts to conserve energy is to sleep the eight hours. so you can conserve the energy and dont be extreced about be more time in school. In contrast if you do not sleep well you feel like you will felt sleep. so is better less hours of school because eveyone will conserve enegy and the less hours of school can bemore better because everyone would be consentrated and learn more.

If I am working and also going to school and the school day extend for two hours. I feel very extreced, so many peolple cuit school. And prefer to work. There are also some disadvantages because if they extend the school day two hours is not inought time to be togeteher with the family. everyone need time to have and be with the family because family is importan. so for these reason my chool should not fallow this model. if you spend more time in a job or in school there is not enought time for the family and olso everyone need time to make the differents responsabiliies that have. for these reasons my school should not follow this model because many people get extreced or cuit school. so they can conserve anergy and resources and have have enought time with the family. and the hours of school everyone can be more consetrated and dont felt sleep and learn the possible.",6,5,5,6,5,4,2455,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
545,3172,79484682B23E,"Should my school follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business to extend the school day to two hours for a four-day week? This idea has an advantage and on the other hand a disadvantage because student will be stress out, some will not get enough time to rest before going to work,and they wont get time to learn. First,students will be stress out. There are different kind of people in a school,some may be fine when it comes to sitting for a longtime,others may have problems. Sitting down for more than three hours can cause waist and back pain. some students may be sleeping while the teacher is teaching. Example;if a teacher is teaching and the students are sleeping,the student will end up not hearing what the teacher said about the topic. When this happens,the student will end up failing the class which is not suppose to happen. Again,most of the student will not get enough time to rest after school before going to work. There are a lot of students in high school who work and cater for their living. Majority work after school,therefore,they have enough time to rest before going to work. If the school hours is extended by two hours,they will not have enough time to rest and will be sleeping later in the day in class. Example;some people do not close early when they go to work,those student get a little time to rest before going to work. This idea is important because,it will help teachers to complete their syllabus in time and also rest on the fifth day,and get time to be with their kids. some subjects involves a lot and needs much time to complete. Teachers always rush when they are teaching just to catch up the syllabus and students will not understand the concept they are teaching but when two hours is added to the time,the teacher will take her time to explain for the students to understand the concept very well. I will conclude by saying,adding two hours for a four-day week school has a lot of disadvantages,therefore,my school should not follow the route of a conserve energy and resource business or else it will affect the academics of the students,and also weak the body since they dont have enough sleep.

I agree that we accomplish more if we are always doing something right or important, however, that it doesnt mean that you are idle. While, if we are working or study.

For example at the job alot of employees that against you because they said that you are idle, and you dont want to do nothing. Insted that the employees at your job dont know that you are tired because you have two jobs. Some people, students or parents lived so tire and they look idle. At my house we live all togethers and sometime i dont to do nothing at my house. My parents argument me that i dont clean the house.

I like to work alone with no body bother me . sometime i like to with work with groups but is all depend what type of people am working with and also how is my mood during the day of in the class. When am working like to listen to music because it let me to focus what am doing and i dont get distracted with the others student talking about drama or what is going on an there life or school. Also when am in class i dont like when teachers or student start asking me question where i am from or what do i like to do. or sometime i like to work when the place is quiet because i can focus more and the place is quiet i can do my work in peaces. Also i like to have my personal bubble because i dont like when teacher or student come to my face and start asking me about stuff that i do not know or when they give me a attitude so that is the time when the situation will star to get worse because every time when the happen i will do the same to do them but mine it will be worse and sometime i cannot control myself. when the work in a group i like to work with people that wont talk to much and we do our own work. Because when i work in group who talk a lot i cannot focus on my work or they are just talking stupid stuff and trying to be funny there is when i get mad or when they trying to put me in there conversion that i do not care because if i am not talking to you or to the group that mean i am good and i do not need you or i dont need your opinion. I like to be my own personality because i know what i am doing and i am doing because i like it and when people told to stuff or me trying to be a different person just because they dont how i am or that way i dress or look. And i cannot be a other type of person who i am not because i will be lying to myself and lying to the people around me just because i am acting different or look different for other people to think i am like that. Also if you think we are friends and you start to get conferees around me and you start talking about your life i am just going to walk away because i didnt ask you about your life because i am not interesting in your life because if i did i probably would ask you but if i didnt ask that mean i really dont care what do you do or what do you like. If i dont like you you better understand i wont be nice to you and i wont try to have a conversation with you. Or event class class if i am not talking with anyone the mean i dont want yall to talk to me or if i dont like the teacher i just keep my distance but if the teacher i dont like and she/he come at know where an start yelling at me i wont stay quiet and i will say stuff back to you because you just come to my face an start yelling at me for no reason so that is telling me that you got a problems with me and i didnt know at about it.

548,570,F3604BAC5D79,"I agree with the Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill because in my opinion, the failure makes to the people strong and the next time they can do it better. Sometimes we are making failures day per day, but if we become sad and we are closed that we can not do it again, we are losing something important in our life, but if we are doing it with enthusiasm we can improve our failures and do it better every time. Success is the achievement of doing what you have tried to do or what to do. Winston Churchill is referring that no one have to loss the enthusiasm, however if you are making mistakes in your life and you are saying that you can not do it and you will try it but you are going to get the same results and you are giving excuse by excuse you will fail in your life because you are giving up easily and you dont see that every cost and fight at the end it has a benefit or something that you really wanted to get or a goal that you are trying to reach and you will see that you dont have to loss the hope and the enthusiasm in every dream that you want. The failure has an important role in the pursuit of success, sometimes a lot of people do not have the enthusiasm and they think that it is the end of everything, the failure can be the destruction for a lot of people, but if you make a lot of mistakes and you are keeping fighting still to get your goals you will see how important is not give up easy and watch the positive part of your failures. When Winston Churchill said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm,"" he is only saying that sentence but it has a big meaning everybody can apply it in their lives, you can find the best outcomes just smiling to the problems. It does not mean that you will not care the problems, of course you have to resolve the problems and make them clear, because if you are making failures and people is affected and you dont care you just want to get your outcomes it will be a big problem, no body needs to be involved in your failures because the people around you will see that you are making a mistake and you are selfish. Churchills statement has big meanings and has good outcomes, everybody wants success but what happen when someone is trying to get success and miss? of course everyone will feel so sad and no one wants to try it again because the person is afraid of their failures, it is like if the failure is tying you and it does not want to leave you. The persons will be sad and their hopes will be down because they think that they are going the get the same outcome, but what happen if you raise your head with enthusiasm? Winston is trying to say us that the enthusiasm is very important to get the success because if you have enthusiasm you will fight with love for something that you really want. An enthusiasm person has more possibilities to get success than a person sad, broken and a person who is thinking just negative thoughts or who is close that they will get the same result and give up easily like nothing will happen if he/she is going to try it. The enthusiasm has an important role in the success because you will keep your head up and keep fighting for your goals all the time and every time that you will make a failure it will be more easy to resolve it, because you have a key and you are enrolling every time when you get one failure. The enthusiasm help to the people to see the answer of the problems easily because the brain will be relaxed and will think the best things, however, when the brain is frustrated the brain can not think correctly. So, if you are enthusiasm you will do it very good because you want something that you want and also it will be something that will improve your life not just in the success of work or study it can be in all your whole life you can get success and everything if you apply this in your life, and the people around you like your family will see how important is this role in the life and they will want to learn about the enthusiasm in the failures and they will understand that sometimes we dont need to destroy ourselves or lost the head in something that we can resolve in an easy way that enthusiasm is helping us to improve ourselves. I agree with Churchills statement because the enthusiasm it is an important role you can motive to other people to be enthusiasm and they can resolve their problems using the same method. Sometimes the failure are really hard to resolve but if you really want to reach it you have to feel enthusiasm because I think that automatically you will see the answer clearly and easily and if you are frustrated your brain will not work and will be closed and sometimes when we are frustrated we are getting extras failure because we dont think clearly and we dont think about it. Sometimes we have to learn a lot from the failure and we dont see it, the failure can be some steps just to reach the success and the goods outcomes. Winston is showing us that the failure can be defeated it does not matter how long it is going to take but before the success you have to keep strong and smiling to the big failure. Winston Churchill is using a statement that means that we dont have to give up easily we have to fight for something that we want to make real. Example: The success in the school can be really difficult and more than one time we can fail because we dont do homework but we want to pass, so if we want to reach this goal we have to enthusiasm ourselves because we have a goal that we want to reach, so we are going to fix our failure and we are going to do everything because after school we want to go to college and get a good job. In conclusion, the Churchills statement has an important role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. The failure is just a difficult step to reach the success and with enthusiasm we can defeat to the failures. The enthusiasm is a supply very important in the enroll for the success.",7,6,7,6,6,6,3606,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"
549,1133,FAC0A72D62EE,"Churchills statement is important to American lives. Currently, people who fail always gets back up to keep on reaching for the goal they want to achieve. However, when people fail, they think they should give up and stop trying. Its important to discuss about these different sides. Churchills statement is important for not giving up or quitting. The first reason why we should never give up is that we learn from our mistakes. when you fail at something you have to understand that its not the end of the world. If you dont get something right or you mess up on it, youll know to get it right next time. Its always important to recognize that you can reach for youre goals to be successful. when you fight for what you believe in, youll never go wrong. The second reason why you should never give up is because you want to reach youre top goals. When you want something, you have to fight for it. People who fail or didnt do something right, they give up and say that they have wasted their time, But in life, we cant always win or do something right. we are bound to fail at some point in our lives and it doesnt feel good. However, we keep on pushing for it because we want to be successful and feel great about ourselves to know that we didnt give up. On the other side, when people give up, they have fail. People who think they have what it takes to be able to get a job, being able to go to a good school, or pursuit their dreams without mistakes, is someone whos going to give up the moment theyve fail. The people who got great jobs or got into a good school, worked hard for it. Even when things went bad, they didnt give up because they work hard for that purpose. Some people who fail, often say that theyre not smart or not that good. If your not that smart, how are you here today? When you struggle on something, you have to understand that the people around you are the people that can help you with deal with youre problems. Friends and families are the people who can help you in your time of need. Finally, whenever you have a goal or something you want to have, its important to never give up or quit halfway through. A goal is something you want to have and by working hard, you know youll able to reach it in no time. Whenever you get stuck or something goes wrong, you always have support from the people you know very well to help you. By not giving up on what youre trying to reach, you can be able to feel confident about yourself and be able to be confident through life.

They feel that because if the school extending two hours more, we can have more time with our friends. I believe that because you can do homework,expending time with your friends, and learn more. One reason why the school days can extending two hours is because alot of students need help with their clases,teachers can help us to pass the clases and that it is good time the students think about, if they want to graduated they can make an effort to pass the clases and dont distracted other people in the classroom. Students have bad grades because they dont listening to the teacher while shes explain. We have bad grades because the class is boring or the teacher is great with the students and she dont say anything when we are using our phones. Second reason why the school days can extending two hours is because you can participated in school activities or, you can play in some games like Soccer, American football, basketball, and you can have more time with your friends and helping the soccer team. you can help to clean the school and decoring some of the classroom, or you can stay in the library and help to organized the books or doing homework, and we can use the computers to search and find what book we want read. Third reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students want to stay in the school doing projects or homework because they dont have time to do in their home some of they go to work, and others students have alot of homework from the others clases, and thats one reason why the teachers be mad with the student because they did not do his homework, and the students explain why he not did that homework we have alot of homework from the others clases and i dont have to much time to do all the homework i have because at night i got to the bed early and the next day some teachers give me more homework and thats why i dont do your homework. The last reason why the school days can extending two hours is because some students need help with their homework, they need to practice more to understand the class but the most important thinks that students need to have are good grades and pass all the test to graduated, if they have very good grades the school will give a certificated to saying we are proud of you, and your family will give to you some gifts because they are proud of you ,and you will graduated without trouble and then any university will accept to you because they will see your grades of your colleges and see how good you was in your clases.

Because when I finish my homework, I feeling so tired and I just want go to my bedroom or play game, message, Facebook, ... I guess thats habit all students because almost students doesnt wanna be work too much and parent will be for son or daughter spend time for favorite like soccer, bamboo, ukulele, ... If the students might relaxing then I think they will learning better and faster. Some parent want my son or daughter go to the bedroom early. Because parent can control them easy, example like some students will say I still do home work on the Laptop, but they playing game with friends. The best way is for students go to sleep early. If your might for students sleep early, It really good for eyes and healthy because one young people can sleeping enough eight our every night, you can feel comfortable for star learning better new day.

554,1992,31EEF9A4A29B,"Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing. I think that students will benefit more from distance learning than from going to school. Not everyone agrees that going school is for them. Distance learning is gives a better chance to learn all your education. Here are a couple reasons why I support the idea of distance learning. First, reason why I think that distance learning is more beneficial to you is because you can manage your time better with class work and classes. You have the opportunity to work on your own schedule. Separate the classes throughout the day instead of all bunched up at once. More time for you to focus on either classes you kind of struggle with or classes most important. All work does not have to have a due date or time limit. You can take your time to understand the material at hand and do all your work when capable. Secondly, the more comfortable the environment the better you work. Schools environment isnt so good for students, sometimes we sit in classes where its hard to learn. Hard to learn because a lot of kids do not take there work serious, stay off task, and distract others from learning. That harms the learning environment makes kids get a little frustrated at times with there work. Its not easy to do your work while not being able to concentrate correctly and being distracted. When you are in a comfortable environment, work is not so complicated. You can relax, think straight, and focus on the task at hand with no problems. Being able to attend class from home keeps you away from the bad environment. Last but not least, the safety of the students is always important. While in school kids can be harmed in different type of ways. Some get bullied others get into altercations. This is hard to stay away from because you are in school and it surrounds you. This can definitely throw off a student and get them off track. When kids start to think about many other problems instead of there school work it is not good. Attending your classes at home, online, or through video conference is the safest way to attend. You wouldnt have to worry about the school drama or the bullies. Your mind will be strictly focused on the work you have to do and nothing less. In conclusion, the idea of students attending classes from home, video conference, or online. Is most beneficial because of there safety, work environment, and schedule. I agree with my reasoning and support them to the max because distance learning is the best way to learn. Your student should give distance learning a chance its worth it. ",8,7,7,7,7,7,648,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

People who choose to be in a successful way, always try to be positive toward every situation. Every person in this world wants to be something that could be remembered forever. To get to what they want to and dream about to achieve it, they must need to work hard, be prepared for everything, and always should be prepared for things that might be impossible to do but never give up on it at any issue. Life gets hard sometimes and gets easy by the time, but it depends on what people choose to live with. Those who choose to live happily works hard, always have positive attitude toward everything. But those who want to be successful but not working enough on it it will get nothing from it. people like ""George Washington"" who are still our heroes are the ones who knew how to get through tough ways by a positive attitude. We all have different habits, we are all different, but we can change the world through our positiveness, not by being mean and not pretend to be working hard for our needs and wants. Positive attitude the something that helps us get ride of our daily problems, doing something in a good way makes is a way to our goal becoming true with no tension. If we want to make our dream come true we have to make it in a good and positive way without hurting anyone, and by loving everyone. the only thing everyone absolutely have to know is that a positive attitude and thinking positive is the way we could get ride of our bad habits and live live in peace. We cant make it through our hard times if we just sit there and dont do what we should to ourselves and other needy people. We all have to be patient, not everyone gets stuff so easily, to achieve something it takes time but we all have to be prepared for things we will face. We might wont make it through in our first try, but we should never quit trying. Everything takes times and have its own limit to get fixed. There are two things that are above all else, one is work hard, and the second one is work hard in silence but in a positive and a good way. positive attitude is the important thing in our daily life. Its not that we have to be 100% so we could get all we want, we all know not everyone in this world is perfect so we have to do things by what we really could do, the only thing that would help us in everything is positive attitude. Nowadays everyone think they could do everything without trying the best they could, and try it in a positive way, but i think they are wrong. If you want to get the same respect s everyone else you need to have a positive mind toward every different thing in this world. Whenever things keep goes wrong we need to ask our selves that are we doing what we suppose to do, are we being what our parents and our country taught us to be, so that way we could stop thing to go from right to wrong and stay positive in every way. before we start to do something new we need to ask someone that is experienced, so we will not get lost in the middle. Never give up on anything in this world things are not hard, we are the ones who makes them difficult to do. We are not pot in this world for keep quitting things to get to our goal, we are here alive to create change in world, to love people, to love the tradition, to keep doing positive and effective things for our generation and the upcoming generations. We are born to make people smile. We are not for hate, we are for love. We all should be trying to change the negative thought to a positive thought. When we have problem to solve, we need to think twice and think positive because that solution would defiantly impact others too. We should all try hard to be in a metier type place. In my opinion everyone should be thinking about how to be successful, how to be something better, how to make others feel better, and make them pot him/her as an idol. we all should always take responsibility for our action and consequences. If you want to be something memorable you have to be the change what others would like in you, and you are the one who could make it through hard and tough ways by a positive attitude. We are the ones who can change the world by just be different and make things easy and effective in a good and positive way. I know we do not want the world to go for hate and negative way instead of a positive and right way with full of benefits. If we want to work somewhere and we dont have control on our bad behavior and have negative attitude towards the boss and other workers we will not be successful, but if we do have control on our positive and negative attitude we will always be successful and always would get promotion in every place we are. Only a positive way could effect us to achieve our needs and wants. ",5,6,6,5,6,6,169,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
556,1059,7B0C76128726,"I agree with Prime Winston Churchill; in he saying there is a lot of true and motivation. Failure is the most important element in the pursuit of success. Being successful is not a easy thing for anyone; there is a journey that you have to get through with many obstacles that you may fail at the first time. Also, no matter how many times you fail, you shouldnt give up on you want to do. When you continue to fail, your learn a lot from this mistakes or problems. The better thing are never easy to secure; we always make mistakes, but never too late to start again. As Winston once said ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm This statement is most certainly true if we are welling go put in the effort to past though feature and attain real success. If you really want something you going struggle for that and effort the most you can. Everyone who is successful has been through things that has caused them to fail in something the admired dearly, but remember you should never lose hope; mistakes allow you to view your challenge from a different perspective. Failure is only an opportunity to begin again, only this time with a better plan and more understanding. Failure is an unavoidable obstacle, so you must be ready to affront and learn about it. Look examples about people who dont lose hope and keep trying until they did it, and see that these people are representation of success. See the mountain theyve claimed and look to it for inspiration and all they sacrifice. In conclusion, we come to learn more from our failures and difficulties than from our successes. Failure can bring us to better ourselves and begin our plans once more, this time more wisely. If everyone was to successes in their first try, we would not feel accomplished in the presence of success. The most important message to take from these quote is that after you have acknowledge both why failed and how it made you feel, you must attack the obstacle again with enthusiasm. Success it is hard work, perseverance, learning, studying, sacrifice and most of all love of what you are doing or learning to do.",7,8,6,7,7,7,1620,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 8, cohesion 7"
557,3177,D2DF0FA5218C,"Has the limitation of human contact due to the use of technology had positive or negative effects on peoples lives? I believe that it is a negative way for people to have too much technology, one reason is because, people get to be more lazy, another reason is that people dont put much effort on what they are doing, and the last reason is that people get to be shy or nervous whenever they go out. People get to be more lazy on the way that technology can bring them everything to their doors: clothes, food, kitchen stuff, etc. They can do everything by only moving one finger, they dont have to make any eye contact with others. If people are always using technology they are not going to put much effort on what they are doing: paper works, homework, projects etc. They just can copy and paste stuff, it is better what they have in their minds, talk with someone else about it, socialize with others so they can have more ideas, one person can explain it to each other so they get to understand it better, be proud of what they did and not what technology did for them, see their skills. Sometimes people get to be shy or nervous when they go out because they are use to order things by technology, they are just on their cell phones and not socializing with human contact, most of the stores have machines so they can get to pay without looking or talking with another person, that way people get to be more insecure of themselves when they have to socialize: job interviews, going to college, making a group when theyre at school etc. With technology, people get to be more dumb in the way that technology does everything for them. It is better to get up and explore the world, give some effort on what they are doing, and meet new people. Some people while they are walking down the street, and they see another person coming they just look at their cell phones so they dont make any eye contact with other people. It is really sad whats happening with our society. While some people believe that technology is a positive way to grow as society however, I think It is making the people to not explore the world or socialize with others. Without technology kids would be in the parks playing games with other kids, having fun, exercising, learning new stuff ouside, and not being in their cell phones playing video games, watching cartoons or YouTube videos that is not going to help them in their futures.

Everybody has a different character trait and I believe it is formed by our parents, brothers, or sisters.

The influence mainly comes from parents and are the role models for their children. Our character traits are formed by influences.

What would you like to accomplish in the future? and why would you like accomplish that? I would like to accomplish to become a billionaire for many reasons. First of all if I would accomplish to become a billionaire, I would buy a house to live in, because Im not gonna stay in my moms house all my life, and I dont think my mom would like that either. I would have a pool in the back of my house. I always wanted a pool so I could swim there and wouldnt have to go all the way to the water park. Or just relax in the pool whenever I have free time. Have parties so my friends and I have fun, and my mom wouldt have to tells us to keep it down. Second I would buy my mom a house, a car and some new clothes. she deserves it for all the hard work shes done. I would sell the house that were living in now. And all the money that I will get for the house, I will give it to my mom. I would take her to see a car that she likes and buy it, because the one that she has is a little old and she is always having trouble with it. I would take her to the Mall to see different stores so she can buy different kinds of clothes that she likes. Then I would buy a hospital. I would not let the hospital charge too much for the patients though, because whenever I go to the hospital they charge to much, and some people dont got a lot of money. I would hire the best people for the job so they can help their patients, some nurses or doctors are not too good at their job. I would let any patient in no matter where theyre from, because some hospitals judged the way people look, their race or the color of their skin. Finally I would help the homeless. Not all the money that I would have would be for me, because some I would give it to the homeless. I would buy them food and clothes, because some homeless people have clothes and some dont, and some are just waiting to be feed. I would buy an entire city block, so I can construct apartments for the homeless. whenever I look out the window, when Im in the car, I see a lot of homeless people siting in the side walk or sleeping on it.

I also like turtles because they walk slow and they look cool. The first thing i would do when i arrive at the Bahamas is buy goggles then go to the beach and run in the water to find Memo and Dory. I would probably document everything so when i get back home ill have a memory from when i was at the Bahamas. I enjoy watching colorful fish swimming in crystal clear water.

562,3292,FE8B7167BD93,"Working in a group is better People in this days are deciding rater to work in a group or work alone. There is a lot of good and bad things between these two options. Most people may choose to work in groups for differents reasons. Here are some of the reason why I think that working in group in better than working alone. Some people like to work in groups because they like to finish faster, also it is a good choice because the information taht you need to look for is divide with all the group members, finally it is good because you meet new people in the group to work with. The first reason why working in a group is better than working alone is because you can finish faster. For example if you work by your-self on a big project you are going to take more time to finish it. Probably you can finish it on time but you are going to spend a lot of time then you. Then if you work in a group everybody in the group can hellp to get it done more fast. With the help of all the members the work is going to be done on time and you are going to have more time for yourself. With more time for yourself you can play video games, watch your favorite show or take a good time to study for another class or a test. Another reason why working in a group is a benefit rater than work alone is because you divide the information about the topic with all the members of the group. For example if you are in high school and you get a big project then there is two choices to do it by yourself or work in group. I think most people in your class will prefer to work in groups because there will be a lot of information to look for. In a group all the members are going help in the project to get a good grade. Everybody are going to be proud of what they did together. Also they can be the best project on the class. The last reason why working in groups is better than working alone is because everybody in the group meet new people. For example in your class you do not talk to all your classmates and this is a good opportunity to talk to them. Maybe in the past you were thinking that they were bad people but doing the project together that let you know that they are awesome. Meeting new people is good because sometimes others may feel alone and letting yourself meet them and letting them meet you, both are going to feel a different way. Sometimes what we just need is a good friend to talk and to do homework with. Some people are going to be disagree with this idea because they may not like to meet new people or because they like to be by their selves. In conclusion working in groups is a good choice because it has good benefits. You can get more time for yourself by finishing faster with the help of your group members. You have lest information to look for because there are other members that are looking for other information. Finally you can meet new people and became a friend of them. There are some other benefits that help to work in a group and understand more about a topic with the halp of all the members.",8,6,7,8,5,8,3876,"conventions 8, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
563,1142,4B174612FD60,"Imagine oneself is a student in high school who is already stressed out by all of the homework and work that One must already finish during the day, but also all of the classwork that oneself did not get to finish during school. Students are already stressed out because of school work, letting a student use their phone as a learning tool would only benefit them in finishing their work on time. This is why teachers should let students utilize their phones as a learning tool and not be against the usage of it when doing school work. Admittedly, students could get distracted with their phones and not get their work done in time. However, Teachers can specify that the use of phones is only for academic use only during classroom hours. That anybody who is not abiding by the rules will automatically get ISS. Therefore, students would understand that it is a serious matter and would not be playing around with their phones and getting distracted. Furthermore, students would not have to wait on the schools slow internet and wifi to finish their classwork on time. Students phones work faster than most of the computers in school and they would be able to finish their work faster. For example at the beginning of the school year at SCHOOL_NAME the wifi and internet were down almost every day. Making everybody in the school that has online classes or just courses that require the use of the internet to be behind in all of their work. Also, schools computers are outdated and full of past information that makes the computers work at a much slower pace than a phone would. This is a contributing factor to students not being able to finish their work because the computers are outdated, it takes most of them at least twenty minutes to log in. Those are minutes lost that a student could have been using to have started their class work and possibly even finish it. Consequently, if phones were allowed to be used for class work then students would be able to finish their work on time and not have to worry is the wifi is working or if the computer is taking too long to log on. In addition, students could take their work home if they are not done with it, and they would not have to worry about being behind on their class work. Students most of the time do not have enough time during class to finish all of their class work. Making their work pile up high and since the school does not let students take computers home they could not take their work home with them. If students have class work on a specific computer app like Microsoft word they would not be able to access it from a computer at their house because they do not have the same system we have in school. For example, one of the classes that I take is econ and personal finance and a lot, if not most of the class is online. If we have to do a vocabulary in Microsoft word I have no way of accessing that document until the next day and by then we would have something completely different to do. Letting students use their phones to do work like in Microsoft word would mean that students could use their phones to type up their paper in Google classroom and send it in or leave it in the drop box in desire to learn. Hence, why letting students utilize their phones would be a great benefit to them. In conclusion, letting students utilize their devices as a learning tool or experience would be easier on them. If students are permitted to utilize their phones in the class room then they would not have to worry about not finishing their work during class. This is why students should sign a petition and turn it in to the principal, so the use of cell phones during class work can be permitted and not be frowned upon.",9,7,8,8,9,8,983,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 9"

Also in a group there is always one or two person that know how to draw, have a good hand writing, or know how to decorate, and one that is looking the thing we need in internet for the work. Also we divide the part to every person and we all are attendant that the work do okay. The job is more easy to do if there if more than one doing the same work. In my final opinion I think that work in group it better them working alone . Because working in groups have many beneficial that we can use wisely. But if you are working in ground and the group is doing nothing if better for you working alone in that situation.

567,715,6A977849DE08,"More is better than one. Asking more than one person will never harm you in any way. What it will do though is make you mare confident about what advice you are getting. So, whenever you ask for advice, always ask more than one person. You should ask more than one person for advice because you might find something that help you with another problem. You might not find what you are looking for but it can help you in the future. Whenever I ask for advice I always have one person that tell me something thats completely different but it always help me out later or with another problem. For example, once I asked my friend if he could give me advice on what to study for the math test. He couldnt give me advice for the math test but he ended up giving me advice for the science test. You always want to make sure you are getting the right advice and collaboration is a big key to finding if the advice, opinion or fact is correct. If more than one opinion collaborates or says the same thing its more likely to be true than the one that doesnt. This method can also help you with a project. For example, when youre working on a project you want to go to more than one website to check if they have the same information. That way you know for sure you are getting the right information. If you ask multiple people for their opinion on something and five of them same give you the same thing but one person says something totally different. You know he is wrong. Collaboration is a good way to check if the information is correct but what if you dont understand the information or dont have enough to back it up. Asking more than one person for the same thing can help you build on the same thought and make it better. Maybe you just dont understand what they are talking about but somebody else might restate the same sentence and that might help you understand it better. I know this because Rome and Islam used the same technique and thats what helped survive for so long. For example, when Rome was going to war with Carthage they didnt have a navy but they found boat from Carthage was up on shore. They took the boat apart and made hundreds of copies of it but they improved it by adding a plank so they can walk over to another boat and attack them. If you are working on a project, a essay or just asking for advice always ask more than one person to make sure its correct and the best.

Others may say that "" Success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"". People say this because they dont try as hard, if they get things wrong at first they give up. People wotn try to work hard and go to success they just give and wait for success to come to them (THATS NEVER HAPPENNING!!!). People also say this ("" success consists of going from failure to failure with loss of enthusiasim"") because they find it impossible that enthusiasim gives you the strength to keep trying. Since they are the ones who are the failure that wont work with the enthusiasimto succeed. Being a failure is not bad. Working to success with the loss of enthusiasim just because we fell a couple of times is bad. Because if we dont work to success and lose our enthusiasim we will never succed in anything we will just live our daily life as a failure. We are all failures but if we work hard we will become a better failure, A failure that succeed in life not a failure who just gives up and loses its enthusiasim. Working to go to success with enthusiasim will help you accomplish your goals and also it will inspire others. Others will also get the same energy as you and will work towards success with enthusiasim. A failure is what makes us strong and successful we just have to give that failure enthusiasim to keep trying and to succeed.",6,6,7,6,6,4,1325,"conventions 4, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Second reason the time after school and third reason why is teachers. these are going to be my reason why in this passage. First reason is homework if we have more time in the school day how would students have time to do their homework. If we had a hour and a half more then teachers shouldnt give homework to students. students shouldnt have more time in school then have homework after school students have have some time to enjoy themselves and still do homework if we have more hours in school students wouldnt have the time to enjoy themselves. If students did their homework after they wouldnt have time to enjoy themselves after because it would be dark outside then they have to go to bed. Second reason is students having time like i said in the other paragraph students wouldnt have time if we had more hours in school. students wouldn;t do fun after homework after school because by the time you know the sun would go down and it would be too late for anything. go out somewhere, play outside, and hang with friends. Third reason why is because teachers. teachers would have more work in their hands teachers have a life too they need to get to their families too. and all the work they have to do would them holding longer which would keep longer away from their families too this is is why schools shouldnt have more hours in school ",6,5,5,5,5,7,3034,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
570,2058,52D0FED6AF38,"Many people debate about this topic since one of the most known scientist said this statement. A lot of people agree and disagree, and from my knowledge, I agree. Imagination is something that everyone has, not everyone has knowledge. Imagination can lead you to imagine things that other people havent. This is how many scientist got fame by just thinking about new things. With imagination you can think about a new type of computers, new math formula, or a new type of material that hasnt been invented yet. Many scientist invented new stuff from just thinking about new formulas or experiments that they could to make something new. Theres also things like the periodic table, that the scientist who made it spent days and nights just thinking about new substances and materials, when he went to sleep, he dreamed about new substances that later on got on the periodic table. Thinking about things in places you shouldnt, like school, could either lead you success and give new things to do and study, or low grades because you werent paying attention, must of the times is the second option. Thinking is most of the times in math, where you have to do a hard equation and think and do a lot of work. If you like to think, that might be your favorite class and you will get good grades. Getting good grades in math is really good, it means that you have a good memory and you can easily learn new things (it usually means that when you can do a lot of problems without having difficulty). Imaginations can also give you knowledge, when you think, it opens a new whole world of ideas. You can basically do anything you want. You can basically experiment with anything you want, but you might not get the right answer or the thing you expected but you will also learn why. These type of things can also help you to learn why something did or did not work as planned. It also helps you think about stuff that you could or not do in real life, for example doing something that is ilegal and you shouldnt do. It also helps when you think a rule or a law is dumb, you can thing what could happen if you did it, that could work to see why its a rule. Imagination is something that everyone has and everyone can use without a limit. Using it can lead to a lot of stuff, such as success and making new things. Knowledge is something not everyone has and not everyone can use, imagining can lead you to learn new stuff without doing much effort or risking to do it in real life and might get in trouble by doing it.",6,7,7,7,7,7,1082,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
571,923,C676CE973E9E,I think that by extending the school hours is not a very good idea. Because there might be some students that have things to do after school and teacher as well. It well effect everyone at the school because there are some student that dont like school very much. So by extend the hours they will not show up to school and that will effect the school and them. I dont think it well be a very good because there might have some student that have work after school. Or they might have to go and pick up there little brother or sister. And by extending the hours it will not let them do it because they have to be in school and some student will lose there job because they had to stay at school all day. Some student might have to walk to school and if you extend the school hours then it well get dark and then they cant walk home alone. It will get dangers to go home alone so its best if the hours stay the same because then they will all be fine and by keeping it all the same can help a lot of people. By extending the school hours the student might not be mad to stay all day at school so some student will not show up at school. Because they will not want to show up at school because they dont want to and that will effect everyone that u know. Because the student will fail and that wont help them at all. If you extend the school hour then there is going to be more homework to do and held at the end. Because there is go to be more work to do at the end. Some teacher are going to have some thing to do and work at thing at there homes so by extending the hours the teacher that have think to do they will not be abole to do it and that will make them mad and then they will quit sand that would not be a good idea for the school and the teacher and the student. So that is why we shouldn do it because it will effect a lot of people and then it will make al lot of people not very happy so if we just keep it the way its soapstone it will be all OK cause then the student will be happy and the teachers will be happy so keeping it the way we have it will help a lot of people.,6,6,6,6,5,6,2694,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

Because if we want to do something in our life we always need to be positive. My first reason is having a good conduct it help us to be a better person, every where we go. Because, is going to be useful For example: If the students go to the school every day; they have to behave with the teachers. They need to be respectful with them. We must do everything that they say because, we are smarter people to understand what is good and bad for us. My second reason is a positive personality is also important. It help us to be more successful. For example: If we are taking a test; we always need to be positive instead of being negative or, if we have bad grades we can asked the teacher to help us. We must do our home works, and extra works so we can improved our grades. My third reason is a good attitude is also important because it described who we are. For example: I helped my friend friend to find a new job were I work. So, she got a interview for the job. I told her to have a good attitude so they will might accept her were I work. I think is important to help others. We always need to have a good attitude so we can be someone in our life. Because, we are smarter people, and we know what is important for us.

Seeing other people on their success makes you have enthusiasm and make you uncomplash your own dreams. Now in days their are people that expect if they try on doing something once they can not succeed again. Humans relay on others for their own achievement. Not having motivation makes you not want to do anything and you will keep failing. If you fail and fail, feel sad and give up you can become depressed. As you stop putting in effort in things you lose interest and do not try. Failure is what makes you strong so you do not give up on trying. Failing is what should push you to make improvement and know your strength. Tell yourself to always think positive never negative you should have enthusiasm because that is what makes you stronger.

Also Some schools offer distance learning as an option for students to attend class from home by way online or video conferencing. I think is good idea, students would benefits from being able to attend class from home. Some students take class in home because they do not have time to go to the school. For example, this e students need to take class from online because they work at night or at day . Clearly, they do not have time to go the school because they time is short and they need to organize their day for take a class so, some students take a class from online because their have many reason . In summary, some students need time for study , and they need this position from online for study and they can finish their class. To day in the world exist many disease, and we need to get precautions with this dangerous disease. So for this problem some students cant go to the school for this big problem.

Because, for you can enter to school minimal you need to have 15 to 17. Also, you have 18 you cant not to enter at school and is a problem because you cant find a good work if you dont have a graduation certificate from school. For example, some students want to study , but they cant because they cant enter to school for their age, I think is so important to exist a program when the people older the age can study line or video conferencing. However, many people need to get a certification but they cant for this problem, also the best solution is studying online is more accessible for them. They can have more opportunities in their life , they can get a better job. For instance students can learning online , is a big benefit for this students was cant enter at school. In definition everybody need a opportunity for study, for get a certificate from school. obviously the students are responsible with their class at home. The benefit was school online or video conference represent is the student get more concentration at home , they do not have distraction for any other students, they do not suffer by bulling and they can get a good grade studying a lone in home. For example, sometime students get bad grade for this reason , distraction , they cant sleep at night also, they need to wake up to early for this reason they sleep in class,and they not put attention because they are tired. Also, the students have the opportunity to studying online they can organize their time and pass their class easy because they are focus with their class online also they not have distraction and its for that reason they get a good grades, students need class online or video conferencing , this program help many studying or many young girl are pregnant.

You should always push yourself to the max on everything you do. Try finding a better and faster way to solve what you already mastered. Work even harder then you worked before. Also try something more harder than the previous thing you did. For example Lebron James, he wasnt rich or wealth when he was little, he had to work hard to get where he is now. Lebron trained everyday to get better, stronger, and put his best on the basketball court so he can stand out from the rest. Even today Lebron James is training to be come the best NBA player ever and works really hard to beat/break other famous NBA players records.

The idea here will be to study the pros and cons with ralation to the particular indvidual and not to the group of which she is a part. First we will try to understand the dynamics of a group vis a vis individual, then understand the various issues involved in working as a part of the group. We would also see as to how those issuse will be influencing the person, be it in the positive side or being a hindrance. Remamber last time when you had to do your project. You must have contemplated doing it by many ways. But some thing that comes to mind very in the beginning is either individually or in a group. Every body by facto knows what it is to be individual and perform a task individually, as she is the only person who is doing the task. But what is group and how it is formed and what are the dynamics involved in it. So what is a group, we may dedine it as a collection of several people who come togethor to do a particular task or goal. And the group form, their structure and process and also deals with how it is functioning. This aspect of group dynamics is relevant in formal and informal groups of all types. In any organisational entity groups are very common entity and hence their study and group dynamics is an important area in the study of oranisational behaviour. Being with group dynamics let us see what exactly it is about, it basically deals with why and how groups are formed and developed. In order to explain the same many theories have been proposed. While group work has a host of merits, it also has its flip sids. Firstly, individual students usually lack the power to control the task as compared to when the work is assigned to one person for completion. Additionally, some group members tend to dominate in terms of contributions while othors may become dormant. In this case, the group may achieve its goal but limit other students. Work well together can achieve much more than indvividuals working on their own. A broader range of skills can be applied to practical activities and sharing and discussing ideas can play a pivotal role in deepening your understanding of a particual subject area. Being part of a team will help you develop your own interpersonal skills such as speaking and listening as well as team working skills suck as leadership, and working wirth motivating others. Some of these skills will be useful throughout your academic career and all are value. In order to maximise these benefits, you will need to manage your group work effectively.",8,8,10,9,9,8,858,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 9, vocabulary 10, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

There own way to be, the way they go through situations, makes people take decisions or actions that someone that has gone through the same situation can help them inspired or make positive things in there life. Once you go through many situations it will be helpful to be inspired and think in someones life. There are so many different opinions and ways to influence someone, they can be reasons or things that happened in the life of a person that will not necessary be inspired by a example of someones action, or life. Also a inspiration can make you feel confidence in a situation were you think you do not know what to do. The influence of a person can always be helpful. A example is only main thing to influencing others, there are many different ways to inspired people. One example that I think is, that they can be moments were you do not need someone to inspired you, you need to think your situation because you are going to try to make it better by the way you think is the right decision for you. Another example that I think of is, that we are humans and we are going to make mistakes and the people needs to learn from their mistakes, they can be many ways of trying to inspired a person but there times were you do not even think of someone to inspired you. When people think of a inspiration or a motivation to do something they do not realize that they probably have been though the same situation but everyone is different, things may work for that person but that does not mean that it can benefit you, it should just be to see it as an example and try to make it better for you and get the positive things. Sometimes it is just an coincidence that they have gone throng the same situation, and they feel identify not necessary inspired, it can also be a way to see how people can have many different ways to handle a situation, like what did I did that that person handle it different than from what I went through if it was the same situation, what can a make different if that situations happens again. Is that there times that they feel touch by the way there life, or situation is similar to someone who when throng the same situation, it can be inspired by the way that they went throng the same problems, feel identify with something that happened to a friend, a family member, or them self. There are times that just by the action that someone can know, can feel, can think they way they felt in that situation, can be so influence by them, for knowing that you have not been the only one that went though that. But it can be helpful to have someone that can inspired some one with there experience, sometimes people do not know what else to do they feel like there the only ones that have gone through the same situation, and a inspiration of a person can help them feel that they have someone who has been through that and that if they did it they can do it. It can also just be in there head that they think they need someone as an example just to be better or to feel confident with them self.

582,3141,4CFAF19AF547,"Technology has it ups and downs with some being useful to use humans and some being harmful and destructive. Has technology come to a point where we need to use it in our everyday life or has it become where we dont even need it because were to lazy to do thing ourselves. I think that limitation of human contact due to the use of technology has had many negative effect on peoples lives because it can cause depression or isolation, can cause some people to lose their touch of reality, and can harm your physical or mental health. Likewise, technology can cause many harmful things. In other words, technology can cause depression or isolation can really be very bad situation especially if you have both. Depression can be caused by technology because many kids around the world get bullied through social media ,and some get very emotionally depressed. Thats when kids want to isolate themselves and dont go to school. Many people around the world like playing video games, and some are very into it that they dont even know that they are isolating themselves from everyone around them. Most people around the world have a phone, a cellular device, and use it all day and dont even come out once. Technology can cause a big impact on peoples life and causes them to have depression. Consequently, technology can also make people lose their touch with reality. Some people can easily manipulate other through the internet. At a young age kid like to TV, YouTube video ,and things like that, and many kids if not all are very gullible. Many videos on YouTube can make kids believed something thats is not true or even brainwash them. Adults also can get brain washed through the Internet. Many conspiracy theories say that the government are trying to brainwash people with technological advancement machine and many to believe that its not true. Some people even get brainwashed by playing so many video game at a young age, and believe what they do in a games is what they can in real life. Additionally, as technology keeps on progressing its just going to keep on getting worse for our physical and/or mental health. Eye doctors say that if your always on a device and it will effect your vision. Technology can mental change you as a person because some people want to be like someone on the internet and change the way they dress and even in some situations their personality. In some cases people have watch many videos of people doing very dangerous stunt. Some people actually try and attempt the same stunt they saw on the video and fail miserably and end up going to the hospital. In the other hand, technology can come and be useful. It can also safe peoples lives in a situation where someones life is at risk. Technology can also come in handy for us to win wars. Its usefulness can make someones life way more efficient. Technology just overall makes like so much simple and easy. People dont even have to stress about thing as much as they used to anymore because of technology. Technological advancement can change the world as we know it. However, technology can malfunction anytime or anywhere. Technology advancement machine can be the cause of someones death. People might think that technology is going to make life easier, but its only gong to get harder. If people just let technological advancement machine do everything for them their physical health is just going to plummet down because people are not getting the exercise they need. Also people need to understand technology is getting in the way of something beautiful, the Earth. Technology is causing pollution around the world and killing our home. Overall, technology is causing all these horrific things to use and we dont even know it until we look around use. I personally think that limitation of human contact to the use of technology can have a negative outcome on peoples lives because can cause people to lose theyre touch with the outside world, can cause depression or isolation, and can a severe effect and peoples physical or mental health. So, technology can be ignored but it will never go away.",7,7,8,8,6,7,1002,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
583,1935,7D2D5053D947,"What are the benefits of working with a group vs working alone. Working alone isnt bad because their no one to rely on. Then and working with a group is more beneficial. reasons being said are more people more ideas, getting help from teammates, and will be less mistake because there more than one person to get help. For example playing in a team sport working with teammates is better than trying to do every thing alone, same thing with a big project. Just like the saying two heads are better than one. defiantly when working on a project. Being alone there going to be mistake because no one will correct you on the paper. Another benefits of working in a group is more ideas coming from different people and taking that you can learn from it. Not only that if a person is stuck on something the group with help out to solve it together, also it will save a lots of time trying to work by yourself. Being in a team that the PE teacher assign you, will be hard trying to play alone in a group or team. Working by your self is not helping the team or people skills. In the long run getting a job there will be times when needed to work with co workers or bosses, doing group projects or playing for a team will benefit that. Because it helping on people skill. That learning in experience knowing not everybody is the same. Working alone helps but I feel in a group is more beneficial. There no motivation being alone it attend to be boring. Therefor more mistakes could happen, limit to some ideas and knowledge, and cant get help because every one is working alone. Doing work in a group helps students be wake, reasons for that is there someone to talk to also it will be less work and save good amount of time. Students attend to dose off or stress when it to much work on their hands. In conclusion I prefer working in a group feel more beneficial then working alone. It will defiantly help in school if a student is doing a project or playing for a team. Also in the long run With jobs, family, neighbors, or starting a protest will help if being in a group.",7,6,7,8,5,7,1650,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

Elementary students should need to know what will go on in middle school and its expectations. So explaining it will make it easier for sixth grade students. once coming to middle school First of all, students should know about the class room expectations. Middle school student should be respectful, responsible, and productive. Kids should know better than to play around ,or ignore teachers and ignore their work. Students should come to school ready to learn not to play around. Kids should be quiet while a teacher is talking and should also be silent while taking a test or quiz. They shouldnt be throwing stuff around the room or be yelling or screaming. When i used to talk i would get in trouble but, i would always listen to the teacher. Second of all, students should know about halls and lockers expectations. While walking in the halls kids should be safe. Students should not run in the halls and, should not push and shove other kids. Because students could get injured. At your lockers you should get your things for the next class and not talk to your friends in the hallways. If you cant open you locker ask a teacher near by. But you shouldnt kick your locker. If i couldnt get my locker open i would just ask a teacher to help me. Dont kick or slam you locker respect the schools things because it provides you with the things you need to learn with. Last but not least, you must know the lunch expectations. During in line to get your lunch you shouldnt be touching everything nor, keep a hold up in the line. Be productive and get your lunch fast then take a seat at you table. If you need anything raise your hand dont get up with out permission. Dont throw food at people pick up your trash once you leave and, dont make a mess. While eating you should stay in you own seat and not at others tables. Once i would go to lunch i would get my food fast then take a seat with my friends at my table. In the cafeteria it is super loud so try not to scream or yell because it will be extra louder if you do. In conclusion this is why teaching kids about middle school is a good lesson to teach elementary school students. So that once they go to middle school they would be ready.

Working with a group can also be fun you can work with kids your age or you can work with people older than you. it can teach you self awareness,kindness towards others and its can influence you in so many ways because if you are working with people older than you are going to start acting more mature and want to live up to your teamates expectations. and also working with a group can improve on manners, behaviour,self esteem, self conduct and politeness. working in group is very important you can have experience and learn alot from other people it also teaches you what to expect and how to prepared for it in the future. it also teaches you how to act around others and teaches you the importance of life so i think that working with a group is better it teaches you better and you can learn better.

Experts may know more about lifes important matters than most people. They mightve learned from experience or studied others, a class of sociology.

Some individuals dont really know how to make the correct choices, they often try to make the worst choices work but that will never happen.

593,651,863550AEB938,"I agree, they should adopt the 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew. Parents wouldnt be worrying all the time, kids would be focusing more on school, and curfew could teach kids how to be more responsible. Teenagers mostly want to go out and have fun with their friends. Teens are more outgoing when their around their friends. Teenagers might even be disrespectful to their parents if they dont let them go out. Teenagers should feel more grateful because of this curfew law. Parents are mainly worried about where their children might be because nowadays there are so many things going on in society and we might not even know. Thats why parents would feel like its a great idea for the city council to put this new law. When parents let their children go out with their friends they usually tell them a time they may go and a time to come back. Most of the time kids dont even listen to their parents and they just come back at whatever time they want, but if they put this law parents wouldnt feel as worried as they usually do when they let their children go out. Kids would actually listen to what their parents are telling them and not just leave and come back at whatever time they want like if they didnt have parents. Society now is really dangerous compared to back then because theres a lot of kidnapping, even killing teenagers. Now the fact that they brought this law parents might start to feel relived because they know that if their children are out on the streets after ten p. m. then they will get caught by the police and theyll have to face their actions. If they put the 10 P.M. curfew law. Kids would go home early to their parents. Kids would go to sleep early. If teenagers would go to sleep early they would be getting a good night sleep and also they would probably not be falling asleep in class most of the time and actually paying attention in class. Teenagers sometimes think its not important to learn like if it isnt important. Thats why they go out with their friends and forget theres even school the next day, but their wrong. We indeed need school to educate ourselves and so we can be a better person in the future. There are so many things teens can avoid so they can focus in their school and grades, but sometimes we make poor decisions by not listening to the adults. Curfew teaches teens to be more responsible. They learn how to manage time and see if they can make it on time because if they dont. They know their going to get in trouble. Teenagers shouldnt be in the streets after 10 P.M. and if they are then its probably not something good their doing. Teens could avoid getting in trouble by the cops or anything by simply going home. Sometimes teenagers like to learn the hard way instead of the easy way. If they dont listen after theyve been told a million times then they have to face their consequences. Teens should look at this new law as protection from not getting hurt or anything harmful. In conclucion, If they choose the ten p. m. curfew hopefully teenagers start listening and respecting the time their parents want them home. Hopefully theres a change in teenagers learning in school, and on how responsible they are. Hopefully they know how to manage their time around their friends and not get in trouble. They should be more considerate about how much their parents worry about them every time they go out and anywhere they are at. At the end of the day this is only doing the best to help teenagers from being in any type of trouble. ",7,7,8,8,9,8,1775,"conventions 8, grammar 9, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

People wished that they could of done something to change what they do for a living and do something they will be truly happy with. There are people who are sad and deperessed on the job they have now. It takes time,focus, and motivation for a student to find the career they truly would want to take in the future. Not everyone is the same there are people who need a long period of time to find out what they would want there career to be. Students might love to do multiple things but cant find out which one to do as there career. Sometimes the students needs to have the experiance and see how it is with there own experiance. Students should not be pushed and forced to pick a career so quickly. Not everyone is able to be like that. Not most students can afford the right education for the carrer they are being forced to take; therefore the whole time the high schools have been forcing them and guiding them towards a specific career it would all have been a wast of time because they could of not afford the right education for that career. If student are being forced in studying a career they dont want to do and then cant afford the right education to do that they are going to be unhappy and they will b forced to go downhill to a job they would never imagine them doing. And in doing so when they are doing something that they never imagined themselves doing then depression and regret will start happening. With the job they are being forced into doing they might not be able in doing it. For example if a student is being forced in a scientific field of learning but they know that science isnt there strong suit they will have a hard time and start having a hard time in that field. Students know what is best for them and know what will benifit them and find a path that would be best for there needs. Some people might say that having students pick a career at a young age will help them in the future because it will give them more time so strengthen that career and become very good at it. What people dont understand is that some students might not be intersted in that and would want something they would b happy with so they can improve on the stuff they know they are good at and have alot of skill in. Students have the right and the liberty in choosing a carrer they would want to do for the rest of there lives they dont need to be pushed into doing it they should take as much time as they need to find what is it that would make them happy.",6,5,7,7,7,7,1416,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
598,3818,E060D90D6CB9,Dear Principal I dont agree with your decisions about the new school policy. I think that students needs exercise. I believe that students joining sports is a good thing for there health and it also makes them happy. Its not good for students to think about school work too much because it causes stress. If you change your mind maybe more students would actually work hard in school because of there accomplishments in school. Kids should be aloud to play any sport without doing anything. If they think about school work and sports at the same time it might cause them to stress out. At the same time i also want them to have fun in school. There are lots of reasons why students shouldnt have to work hard just to play the sport they want. Changing school policy is a bad idea. I think it will encourage kids to work harder in school. Not only it will encourage them they will also have a better future. Changing the school policy back to normal would be a good thing for kids. They will also have a good exercise everyday because it encourage the to practice. I am also a sports fan my myself. I know how it feels if that happens to me. I wouldnt like it if I have to worry about my school work and my favorite sport. I hope that you will change your mind after reading this note. Sincerely: STUDENT_NAME,6,7,6,7,7,6,3193,"conventions 6, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 6"
599,3854,38FA6185D43F,"Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and I agree with what former said because to succeed in something you have to accomplish many steps to get there. Feeling motivated helps you succeed and accomplish your goal. Its better to keep failing at something over and over again because you can see what you need improvements on but eventually youre going to succeed. For an example, my sophomore year I was taking geometry and I didnt do very well during the school year but there was a point where I just didnt even care anymore. I failed all four quarters for that class during the year and I dont blame anyone but myself because I know I was capable of passing and succeeding the class. The reason why I didnt pass the class was because I didnt feel motivated and I just gave up too quickly just by a few fails I made. I kept failing constantly so I didnt even try anymore but If i wouldve followed from what Former said, I know I wouldve succeeded during the year. However, I took the class again that same year during summer school and I knew I had to pass and give it my all. From all the fails and mistakes I made, I learned from them. I kept practicing and I kept motivating myself, there wasnt a moment when I doubted myself. By the end of summer school I passed the class and all I had to pass was my SOL and I know I had to work hard to pass the SOL so I kept studying. The same day I took the test, I was going to receive my score and I took my time on it but eventually, my teacher told me I passed and I ended up getting the highest score from the class. I was proud of myself even though I failed many time I eventually succeeded. Former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill once said that ""success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm"" and from my experience thats why I agree with what Former said. The most important thing you cant do it do is give up because If i wouldve gave up I wouldve never succeeded. Its worth it to fail over and over again but without loss of enthusiasm and eventually succeeding.",7,7,7,7,7,8,740,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

First, when you meet someone and you see how they act you get those feelings about them if it was hate or love. Second, you may never meet that person agean, so the way he act this one time is gong to make you judge them. Third, or even if you see them every day the way they act toured you give you thats feelings that never will Chang toured them or your impressions. Finally,that why you cant Chang your first impressions. Those feelings that you get turd that person, if it was love or hate is because of the way they act. For example this one time i met someone and it was my first time meeting him so i did not know what to expect from him. After talking to him i did not like the way he talk or his personality so my impressions for him was not good and i never Chang the idea that i took of him. I never met that person aegean in my life.

601,787,4B0CF2CFCB4A,"Should people follow their own instincts, or should they follow other people step? If people seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters they would not fail in life; however, people should make their own decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience through the life. First, people should make their own decision because they can define their self. Every single person should make a difference on the world. For example, I do not like to be guide for others person, I like to be different than every one else, try new things, and have my own ideas. Also, around the world are many people that are known for define their personality and for try to change the world with their ideas. Barack Obama is one of them, he was known for his humanity and his charismatic. Every person was made it to perform extraordinary different decisions. People should make their own decisions because they can define their self. Next, people should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Many times ours instinct are right, but sometimes we let others person tell as what to do, therefore we fail. For example, when we are taking a test and we make cheating, we fail the test because we not even like to try and follow our instincts. When I have to take a test and I do not know much about the test, I just follow my instincts and at the end, I got good result because is not necessary to do what others persons do. Is more about what you believe that is the best. There is not major accomplishment than do your best, to believe on your-self. People should make their own decisions because they can follow their instincts. Finally, people should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. When a person make their owns decision do not matters if they are successful, or if they fail. Because at the end they learned how it was it and how to do next time. But if they never try, they never would know how hard, or easily is achieve something. For example, last year I fail all my SOL because an friend told me that he pass it all his SOL and was easily. He suppose to be a expert, so I truth he. But was not tru and I learned that is better try by my self. now I capable to give advice to anthers students and help them. If I never had make my own decisions, I would never get experience. People should make their own decisions because they can get experience through the life. In conclusion, people should make their own decisions because they can define their self, follow their instincts, and get experience. Every person should make the difference on the World and express their own ideas. When people follow their instincts we accomplish good result. Also, when people got experience through the life following their instinct they could be successful and are capable to advice other people. Every single person have different opinions, decisions, and experiences. With differents person we can build a rich world.

602,1263,FB6F9B24FD1B,"I think that students should commit to their career at a young age because it will move them and encourage them to go further into being someone that people can rely on, and its a big help to society and the community and it will help it a lot because theirs generations that had some kid that turn into an adult did their part in that generation and the after that and after that, and some things change in the peoples mind once they get older and wiser and that is the big picture. Also some students might change that career because they want the best for them selves and its not bad to change who you want to be in the future because no one is choosing this for them, they are the one thats doing this for the best of them so when they want to make money love what they do to get money with passion they are living the life of a normal money making person and it doesnt matter how much money your making its STILL MONEY!!!! and some people around the world still dont get that. Soon they will want to go to college and thats big step into having their career because theres more studying to it and the teachers arent as nice as you think they are and they will be very comfortable with you goofing off in class, after that your out of the game, also it a lot of money to pay yearly for their tuition and depending if your were born poor, rich, some what rich or wealthy enough to pay then your fine to stay in their to study party relax and play video games with the boys and eat a lot too if your close to a restaurant, cafe, buffet or a diner then go ahead and fill up that empty stomach. After that when they have a good time their and read to graduate theyll go to a University, and I gotta tell ya it not the same as college, it more studying and more work and if you can handle that pressure with no sweat then your set for a nice year in there, but depending how long your going to stay there, it can 1,2,3 or 4 years when you think you have enough knowledge about your career and studies then your set to get a job that pays you well and have a happy life. Now that we got that out of the way, we need to talk about how the students are going to be effected by by all that has happened to them and how far got to that end point of their journey to be successful in life and be some people he or she can help one another so they make that persons life better and make them feel happy, the students need to be happy with how they are working because if they dont they can have stress and anxiety and soon they dont want to work any more and we cant have that in our generation, so we have to let them be someone that they want to be before some one else will!. Before all that, about all I said about the colleges and universities, their Parents, oh yeah the big dogs the ones who have created you to be a good person with a good career their child/student get older, the students have to tell their parents what they want to be when they grow up to be an adult, yes I know that they always say that when you were a little kid, but your still a kid but a teenager from the age 13-17, your still going to be told that and you have pursue your dream or goal of being someone that goes without saying, so this is why students should identity their careers by the time they enter high school.",4,4,6,4,4,5,3807,"conventions 5, grammar 4, phraseology 4, vocabulary 6, syntax 4, cohesion 4"
603,2338,924748264D34,"High school year is the most important year in students life. Some school programs allow students to graduate in three years,if you can choose, which one would you like to take? traditional or three years? For me, I would think of four years high school. Because traditional four years high school is more better than three years high school. For example, if you take three years high school, then you can not take elective courses except you take the courses during the summer time. Also, I think three years high school dont have much time to let you get ready for college. In addition, I think four years high school is more comfortable then three years high school. First of all,if you take the three years high school, then you cant take elective courses except if you take the courses during the summer time. I think have elective courses was important, because that mean you can take courses that you interesting of. For example, I was taking the traditional four years high school right now. A year before, I remember I have two elective class, and one of them was Korean. Even know learning different language is hard, but it was very interesting, because you are learning about another countries culture and how did they treat people in their ways. Thats why I think elective classes was important. secondly, take the courses during the summer time? Of course not. In the summer everyone was plan go to the beach or traveling to another country with the family. Think about that sunshine, sky, golden sand, and beautiful seas. There are people swimming and surfing, people wear the sunglasses sat down there and have coconut on their hand. But at this time, you have to take courses at home or summer school. Sitting at chair, face all these hard problem and finished it. In addition, summer is the time that people relax and have fun of. So I would not taking the courses during the summer time. In addition, lots of students are feeling nervous and scared in the last year of their high school time. Because they are wondering what college they going to and can they do well when they get in the college. Even know I was senior right now, but that still happens to me, because college is totally different than high school, and I worry a lot about it. So when I laying down on the bed at the night, I was start thinking about college, can I make friends in college or what if the class that I take is going too fast then I dont understand what teachers are talking about. So I think four years high school would have more time to get ready for college. Even know some programs are allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years, but think about that, if you and your friends didnt go to the same college, then you will have to leave them early and you also have to leave your family one year early. Finally, I think traditional four years high school is more better then three years high school, and it makes you feel comfortable and have more time, instead squeeze the time together and make your self busy then others. Lastly, these are the reasons why I think traditional four years high school is better then three years high school.",8,6,7,7,6,8,1937,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

606,1852,ACE3E472041C,"Does taking classes from home benefit students. People might said that,taking classes from home is a bad idea, that is not useful that kids dont learn and they do nothing. In case other people will said that it benefit kids , that keep them safe and I will agree by saying that taking classes from home benefits kids. Well I think that parents, who decided that their kids need to take classes online is for one of many reasons. for example , I will provided you three reasons why I think kids do home classes and it does benefits them and yes they learn from it . Parents are famous and they cant send their kids to a regular school,kids might be in danger and they can attend school because of that or it might be because they have any medical condition. First reason why students take classes from home is probably because their parents are famous people and they know that, if they send their kid to any school, people will be chasing them,asking for pictures all the time or may be telling them bad stuff. Parents know that in that situation kids are going to be frustrated about it, sad, angry and defently they will not be able to concentrated at school. It will be hard for them to be free and enjoy school. For example on of my friends he is very famous in my country and also in here wherever he goes people is always chasing him, hi has a kid that is 6 .years old but he said that the hardest part is when the little boy goes out all of these people get to him and he gets scared. Thats why he said that he decided to pay for home classes, and they prefer their kids to take classes at home. Kids will feel free and no body will be making them feel uncomfortable. Second reason it could be because the life of any kid can be in danger and the parent of the kid and also any school will know it. They know that if any kid, that is been treated lets said by any organization, attends to school people will try to harm him or it can become a bigger problem. Because the school will defently knows that if they received that kid at school they will be putting the life of many other kids at school in risk and they will not take that change. Of course parents are not going to allow that their kids to be harm or kill. Thats why the school or parents proffered to have their kid to take his/her classes from home he/she will be safe and other people too, the kid will get a really good benefit from it because he will learn and he will be safe and other people will be too. Last reason why students get benefits from taking classes at home is probably because they have any medical condition and its hard for them to attend any school. They will feel shame,afraid,scared and they will be thinking that everyone at school is going to make fun of He/She, that they will bully Him/Her and of course as I have said before parents will never for any reason are going to let their kids to be unhappy to feel bad to feel frustrated and feel that no body love them thats why they let their ids stay at home and take classes from it so that way they learn and no body will harm them make they feel worthless. in conclusion,parents who made the decision to let their kids stay at home and take classes from home they make one of the biggest and hardest decisions in life. Because they know that kids will be safe nobody will hurt them, be hunting them , no body will hurt them, tell them mean stuff. They will not feel embarrassed to let people see them, Parents know that defently is not going to be the same that it will not be the same as if he was listening directly to his teacher and getting his note but they know that at least his kids are going to be safe and they will learn to they will still get benefits from it. When you want the best for your kids and you love them more that life itself, you do what you got to do if that means to pay for his classes in other to keep them safe,and we all know that people might talk and told you that doing home classes isnt going to help you. But you know that is not true, you got to keep working working hard because sometimes students come to school, but they do nothing. What they do is get in problems fight, with other classmates or eventhey fight whith their teachers,they used drugs at school but. If you know your kid is at home working and you see that he wants to learn the dont listen to the rest of the people.",6,5,7,5,5,6,2325,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 7, syntax 5, cohesion 6"

Other reason to not conserve energy can be the air conditioner if we dont have energy the air conditioner is doest work and depends how is outside the weather can be affect at the students, and teacher because what if is snow outside and we dont have air conditioner we can get sick or pain in bones, if we dont have energy we cant charge the phones and we cant talk with our parents or if we have an emergency and we dont have energy how we called at the ambulance ,is thats why energy is a really good resource to comunicated with other and make somethings importants . In benefits ,we can safe more energy because we use the energy just in limited time , the bill of the energy in the school can be less than then before and we can have more resources for our school too .We can have differents activities outside.

608,1195,CC24D88BEB8E,"I agree with Churchills idea that success consists of going from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm; Although, many people believe that failure will take you down and make you doubt about your potential; however, failure also help you to progress, gives you different ways to achive your goals, and makes you become even stronger than what you were before failing. Failure is always there, a lot of times we thing failure is a bad thing, but failure is a key thing for success, it will prepare you efor even much harder situations, if you dont fail how are you going to progress?, fail and mistakes help you learn from them, help you to become stronger and they let you know that things are not easy. You have to put more effort on the things you want to get and mistakes are just there to help your progress. Sometimes we just need different ways to solve problems and failure is there for us, when you fail you know what you are not going to do next, it give you choices and failure let you know the things you couldve done to avoid it. When I started to play soccer, I didnt know how to kick the ball correctly, because I only knew one way to kick the ball, I failed a lot of times, but i didnt give up, I started to kick the ball in different ways, I placed my foot in different positions to kick the ball with more power or if wanted to kicked it with more precission. All those fails helped me to realized that there were many other ways and not only one way. Failure also makes you stronger, because when you fail and you are beaten down and you go there even stronger and achieve what you wanted to achieve you are a new person, a new and strong person that doesnt give up for a simple mistake, a person that when everything looks like its over, comes back with more confidence to not make the same mistake again, that mistake helped you to become even stronger than what you were before it. Edison was asked ""How does it fell to fail 100 times?"", and he answered, ""I didnt failed, the light bulb was a proyect that took 100 steps to be done"". In conclusion, failure and mistakes help you learn from them, failure gives you other ways to accomplish your goals and it makes you stronger than what you were before, I think people shouldnt be afraid of failure, they have to start failing, because when they get to reach their goals, their satisfaction when they achive it, its going to be even bigger.",7,6,6,6,6,6,2794,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 7"

It is too important because the lack of language and credits are needed. United States is an immigrant country and their schools has these excellents programs called ""Esol"". Of course, immigrants need these kind of help. They need to get involved by attenting to school. Why? Many immigrants come to this country to have a better future, they absolute have different customs, a different kind of thoughts, etc. So that infers a lot more than you think...Especially, each country have a different systems programs for graduation like in South America you only need to pass all of your classes for graduation, but how many classes are they? More than 17 classes. In United States you need to pass all of your classes plus the SOLS. This is the reason why immigrants must attent to school, It does help you to refresh your mind, to have new thoughts, new experiences, and to know what you need for graduation. Its is hard because Immigrants needs an esol teacher and to not attend to normal classes for awhile as long as you learn the language.That is why it takes a little longer for them to graduate and that is why they do need to attent to school. To understand much better the topics of each SOL class because they do need credits as any student. Otherwise if they choose the option to attend classes from home by way of online or video conferencing is not going to help them as much as the school will. In conclusion, a better learning is by attending classes from school because school give you more opportunites, more methods of learning, to socialized, to communicate. It inpires you to keep going and to have an idea of what you want your future to be like. Which means it prepares you for life. Any issue that you have they will help you to work on it, to find a solution. Like this student did not like to communicate at all, but he noticed that attending to school is the best option because it gives you the ideas of what you want to do, the opportunity to meet the college you want to go. To know what you can do to improve yourself! Also, It helps immigrants to learn the language with this program to pass your SOL classes to graduate, they receive a double help from school. Going to school has more benefits than you think so you need to fight for it because anything in this life is not easy, but is worth it.

Math, English, history, and science are some classes that students need to learn. If students take classes from home, then student will not learn so they will not benefit from it. Students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will gain less exercise, students will get less social communication, and student will be less focus. Many claim, students will benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because they will feel more comparable. However,students will not learn anything even if they feel more comparable at home. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. To begin, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. For example, Generic_Name, who attend classes at home before, said that he will get less exercise, now that he goes to school he gets more exercise than before. To further detail, two friends, Generic_Name and Generic_Name, both attend classes at home before, they would both say that they would gain very little exercise before going to school. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will gain less exercise. Additionally,students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. For example, Generic_Name, a girl who use to attend classes at home, would not communicate much with other students at first, after some time she is able to communicate with other students. To further detail, Generic_Name, would talk very little to other students because he use to take classes at home, after a while he would talk to other students. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because students will get less social communication. Lastly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home because student will be less focus. For example, Generic_Name ,a student who attend classes at home, had to difficult time focusing on the lesson at home, some later she began to understand the lessons. To further detail, Generic_Name had a terrible time focusing on the lessons when he toke classes home, he said that his surrounding was very distracting. Clearly, students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from at because student will be less focus. To concluded, student will gain less exercise, have less communication experience, and will be less focus on lessons are reasons why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes at home. These three argument state why students will not benefit if they are able to attend classes from home. If students attend classes at home then student will not learn a home. There is one option: students should not attend classes at home.",8,7,6,6,7,7,2177,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
613,1656,2BAF09F7004D,"As we know the modernization through the years is bringing us new advances in technology. One of the most important and positive effects of use of technology is make life more easy for everyone. I mean, the use of social media is given us a lot of way to communications no matter where we are; the facilities of communication and information on time are essential to accomplish many task. The complexity to communicate and create different way to interact had making a great way to a efficient communication. First of all, the use of technology is currently having big impacts in our lives. It is changing through the years the way how the humanity is living. There out are a lot of brilliant brain creating new advances in technology everyday. The expansion of the new advances day by day is given us a renovation of our life style. The interactions between everyone through communication using different devices such a computer, phone, iPad, etc.. The principles of those project of advances created and expended by people expert in technology; theve been implement the necessity of technology in every single places. It can also influenced our mental and physical health; depression and anxiety are common nowadays so there are website to providing helps online. The variety how we can combine knowledge in technology are infinities. That is one of the main reasons. Secondly, we are breaking all the limitations that we had before. If you are trying to communicate and if you were in large distance was limited because we did not have those resources such a Mobile devices. So now, we are currently, sending messages or texts, even we can do video calls on live simultaneous. This factor was not possible without the technology. Everyone is connected around the world. Those limitations are breaking because all the different social media: Facebook: One of the most famous and popular website to post, share videos, photos, websites, links. Twitter: This app is used mostly to post personal thought or opinions. Instagram: To post and now with new implement of sources for marketing. Gmail: It is one of the most popular account to mail. It is like Email but it is more modern. Email: is mostly used to messages. Blogs: is used to shared a personal version. It can be about life style, hobbies. Anything you want. YouTube: This is a platform with the purpose of given us videos some of them can promoting companies. In addiction, one of the important advantage is the facilities to do everything we want, when we want, where we want. The use of technology in school, colleges even work implement the easy way to accomplish everything. Now days, school bring to their students computers with the the purpose of advances in every single student to do their homework/assignments in home with all the necessary facilities. They want to give students information through books that you can easily get online. In the pass, it was impossible because you had to go to the library and get the permission to read a few books. So, now with the technology we can also use the technology with the purpose to sell or buy things online. Amazon is a good example of success marketing in the world. People buy things on Amazon because they do not have enough time to go to the store and buy their stuff. The platform of amazon is giving us enough details about those items that we want to buy. The majority of shop stores or companies have websites. This is creating a red of new jobs. Some people can work even in home using any device because technology is making that possible. Sometimes, the use of technology can be optional but something is a necessity. We have to adapt to the new modernization. That is because technology. Although even, there are some statements about some negative effects of technology such a limitation of communication, I can prove with real facts how the technology facility the interactions of contact to other people for example: group chat, messages, Facetime, live videos. Students can be connected with their classmate or vice verse even with their teachers. They just have to be connected. Social media is creating a direct and indirect connection to others, I mean the students can have conversations about projects or assignments through their phones or any device. The use of technology can be fun. We can use technology in video games and some of them have communication though microphone and we can really interact with our partner. We also can extend the communication and interact not just once or two as many as we want. Technology is given is entertainment. Sometimes we just want to be in our conform zone and that is okay. So its up to us if we want to work, play with somebody else or by ourselves. Its true that we can decide if we want to work, have fun by ourselves but the technology bring us the opportunity to interact with others. Finally, the use of technology is part of our lives already. We can deny the use of it in our daily activities. A simple example: If we are going to get a job, mostly of the applications are online. Every job is associate with technology. The use of them created good benefit in everyone. The effects of technology depends with the purpose we are using it. If our purpose is to using the technology to good benefit, the used of them will be successful either the purpose is about good or bad things. ""Every action, have a reaction"" Isaac Newton. The results of our good action will always have a positive effect. I can concluded, all those positive effects are making our work more easier. The use of technology in our society is impulsing us to be betters every day. All the results of hard works by every of us. The innovation of those advances are creating new mechanisms in our routine, new life style and all that is because we are smart enough to created technology, everything started from us.

614,3870,E926BE6F104E,"Working in a group can be helpful. Working alone is also good for you because you can focus and get the job done without being distracted. Seeing people working in groups shows that really only 2 people do the work and the rest play around. You also dont get the full learning experince working in a group than you get working alone. When you work in a group you dont know your strengths and weaknesses your just wondering what to do but when working alone, you can realize what you need help on and what you dont need help on. Working in a group can make you lazy, because you depend on your group to do the work for you most of the time. Personally I would rather work alone than work with a group. Working alone gives you peace, quiet and space that will help you work at a fast pace. When you work alone you tend to ask your teacher qustions in order to help you and thats good. Its also gives you the power to do what you thinks right. Working in a group, you cant do what you think is right the whole group gets to decide the answer. Working alone can also benifet you by your grade they show you how well you did on it or if you did bad. If you did bad then you can study and see what your missing out on and that can make you better and understand the topic correctly next time. My personal preference is working alone even though working in a group that could be a great experince Id rather work alone. It gives me motivation to get my work done faster then not caring. You can get distracted and carried away fast at this day and age. Alot of students love to work alone its a great time to themselves and to finish their work. Working alone saves you the trouble of getting blamed for something you shouldnt have been blamed for. So i think working alone is more benificial for everyone. Unless you are assigned a project and its due very quickly then thats the perfect way to work in a group. But thats a whole different story.

Not working with a company that they make her work hard and pay her little money, when my mom came to his country [U.S.A] she start working for a women that women put her to do alot of house and pay her little money and when my mom told her that she was giving her alot of work she was angry at my mom.

Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didnt do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I believe technology is bad for our life. And technology will hurt many people. First of all, Technology had negative effects on peoples lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. Since, I was in Generic_City, I forgot my phone to bring outside. And I was doing nothing that day. I thought I have to focus my life without technology. We can do many things without technology. For example, we can do shopping with friends, we can play board game with people, and we can do talking each others. I believe technology making me more dumb. Also, technology will be my life controller. Second reason is if we are in the house, we didnt do any communicate with family. When I was in my house our family did not talking and they are doing their own work. I was so sad about this. My mom just watch TV, my dad did a slept, and my sister did play the phone game. At that time I want a talk to my family but they was very busy. I miss my time to talk about my school life with my family. Also we did not know about each family members favorite and what you dont like.

Too much technology will dangerous in your life. I love game, but I delete my all games because when I was young, I started the game, but I get sick more and more. I thought ""If I am doing game more I will be die."" So I was delete all my games. Also, You will be overweight. Because your not moving and you ate a lot, you will be fat. I worry about that. Dont kill yourself. In conclusion, technology allows people to complete many tasks without having contact with others. But my opinion is this will be negative for peoples lives. Because we can do nothing without technology. If we are in the house, we didnt do any communicate with family. We will get sick. I think you can do technology. But not that much.

619,1457,F9E1434B2151,"Throughout the course of our history,education has always been placed amongst the most important necessities,as it not only helps us learn and better ourselves,but because it also opens new doors and possibilities for us. In the past,schools couldnt offer differing alternatives,because technology wasnt as present as it is today. Schools can now offer education to students,all while being at different locations. By students taking classes at home,theyll be able to benefit because they wont feel as socially distressed as they would in person,the level of education could be better and possibly help them graduate earlier,and they wontt have to endure social issues, such as bullying. Many people tend to believe that because they go to school,they wont have a hard time adjusting and fitting in with the masses,but to contrary beliefs,theres a lot of people who do struggle with social anxiety and overall,tend to have a hard time fitting in. Firstly,an example of this, is my cousin Generic_Name. He does have friends,but he feels extremely overwhelmed by being around so many different people,mostly because hes always struggled with social anxiety. Generic_Name decided that he would still like to pursue and attain his education,so he started looking for different alternatives that could help him do so. After much research and gathering of information,he concluded that distance learning was the best choice for him,as he wouldnt have to endure overwhelming amounts of people,or feel pressured by the constant necessity of having to wake up early during the mornings. Another example would be my friend Generic_Name,who never really had problems of fitting in and making friends,but overall disliked the whole ordeal of the school system itself. She then decided to pursue her education through another medium,that medium being,distance learning. Secondly,what a majority of people dont tend to realize,is the fact that you could achieve a better education,and even graduate at an earlier rate. This is another benefit of distance learning. Many people tend to believe that attending school,actually decreases their chances of being able to graduate early and of becoming more independent from their families at a younger age. Many individuals throughout the course of the world,utilize distance learning because they would like to achieve their educations at a faster pace,than those who are enrolled in schools. A prime example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. He was an excellent student while at school,but he wanted to find a way of being able to take advanced courses,that not only prepared him for college and provided him with advanced credits,but also helped him graduate at an earlier age. Generic_Name is now a professional,with a degree in marine biology. He achieved these accomplishments,all at the young age of 25. Another example would be my other friend,Generic_Name. She had always excelled at school,but she wanted an alternative that provided her with a better education and a chance of being able to enroll into college at a younger age. After much thought and consideration,and much conversation with her family and peers,she ultimately decided that distance learning was the best choice. As of now,Generic_Name has graduated at the young age of 17,and is estimated to graduate out of college at the young age of 19. Finally, an issue,that as of now,still affects many schools around the world,is bullying. Bullying has been an issue that has always caused concern amongst the masses,and sadly,its an issue that is still ongoing till this day. Among the many issues that affect public schools throughout the whole world,bullying is still one of the most commonly and frequently mentioned. Despite the benefits of not feeling pressured,being able to pursue a better education and graduating at an early age,distance learning is also an alternative that many people, whove unfortunately been victims of bullying,provides them an opportunity of being able to continue with their studies,and a feeling that they are no longer exposed to issues,such as bullying. An example of this,is my friend Generic_Name. During his first couple of years in high school,he was brutally mocked for always standing out amongst his peers,and he not only felt massively insecure, but he also developed many social problems and insecurities. He had tried many alterning ways of possibly pursuing an education without having to worry about being mocked,until he finally discovered distance learning. He discovered,that he could still attend his classes and carry on with his regular school activities,all while being at the comfort of his very own home. Luckily for Generic_Name,his bullies actually turned out to be massively underachieving,so much so,that they ended up being expelled from school. He then decided to return to school,and luckily for him,he started to fit in. If it wasnt for distance learning,Generic_Name wouldnt have graduated his freshman year,or his sophomore year. People shouldnt really be afraid of trying alternatives that differ from the norm,they should always read and educate themselves on the pros and cons of distance learning. As technology continues to expand beyond realms we couldve ever have possibly imagined,the future of education could one day narrow down to distance learning.

They believe that in order to build self-steem they must complete achievements. I believe that students do not need others to praise their work, even when they did not put enough effort into it.

However, I firmly believe that students should put effort on what they do and that they do not need other people to praise their work only to make the feel confidents with themselves.

Finally, students will always need others to tell them what they did is amazing to raise their self-steem. This matters because there are people who still believe that praising a students work will help them to be self-consident. Second reason I believe that students do not need to other people to glorify their work is beacause it would make them think that everything they do is correct. Students will think that they are not capable of doing more than what they believe they can do. For example, they will always check their work with others only to feel confident with what they did. In addition, I think it is best to tell students that they need to be confident with themselves instead of praising their work. FInally, students do not need others to praise their work in order to be self-confident. This is importan because people have to tell students that they need to be self-confident, even when what they did has not their best effort. Third reason I believe that achievement is the key to build self-steem is because only achieving what we want we can feel confident with ourselves. I think that to build self-steem we must put a lot of effort to achieve what we have to do. Students need to achieve what they have to do in order to be self-confident. This matters because students should know that they need to work hard and that means to put their best effort, if they want to build self-steem. In conclusion, I believe that people should not praise the students work only to help them build their self-steem. Sometimes they have not put their best effort in their work. They are going to feel that they are always doing exactly what they needed to do, even if is not like that. In order to be self- confident students must do achievements. However, some people will not agree with my opinion and they will say that it is best to tell students that their work is well done, even when is not only not to make them feel bad or to damage their self-steem.",7,8,7,6,6,8,3316,"conventions 8, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

I believe of working in group you can make friends, helping together, and have more time for you work. The first reason, if working in group you can make friends because you need talk about the work, sometime the students speak their experience or opinions about the work,but when the students is not the same country, and the works talk about the country or religious is good because. The students have different opinion and sometime you make friends when you with other students have the same opinion, and when working in group you and your friends have time for talk.

629,3581,E974548BFD00,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered,you will never grow"". Doing something that you have already mastered means that you wont grow. I agree with what Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote because it is always good to try new things. Would you want to try something new and master it or keep doing the same thing? First, people can challenge themselves with new things so they can experience life with obstacles. Challenging themselves means that they will try to do something even when its hard. Challenging people with hard things means that they are not going to give up even when it gets hard. Why wouldnt you want to challenge yourself with new things? Its good to try new thing because doing something that you have already mastered is good but what about trying to master something else. If you want to grow even more it would be better to step out of your comfort zone and experience new things. Also, Having more experience with life means that you are growing up. Growing up means that you would have to try new things and not only stick to one subject. Wanting to try new things in life is good because your brain functions better and you get more knowledge. You will have more knowledge in your brain which means that you could master more and more things. Mastering something is good because you get to have more self esteem and you will feel good about yourself. Feeling good about your self is really important because you will need the motivation to master something in life. You cant master anything without having motivation because then it will be a mess and it wont turn out good. Therefore, wanting to try new things is good because you can be open minded. You can also have many ideas that you could jot down. Wanting to try new things gives you a lot of ideas on what you want to master. In the process of thinking of an idea to master you get so excited that there is a lot of planning and ideas in your head on what to master in. It is always good to feel confident because without confidence and motivation you wont have the energy to do what you originally wanted to do in the first place. Trying new things is also good for your social life because you will come in contact with people that has so many creative ideas and you can talk to them and they would probably help you on what your ideas can be. However, not challenging yourself with new thing,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things may not be good you could end up being comfortable at where you are at. Being comfortable is good but not challenging yourself to do whats best is bad because your not giving yourself enough credit. If you dont work hard to master something that you truly want to master in then there is no point in trying to master it. If you dont try to master in anything you wont have any hope and you will become lazy and you will stop trying the hard work that you are trying to do. Trying new things is apart of life and if you dont do that than you would struggle a lot in life. In conclusion, challenging yourself,having more experience with life,and wanting to try new things is better than being comfortable at where you are at in life, being lazy,stop trying,and dont want to try new things which means that you will start struggling in life. having new experiences is better than only having old experiences because with new experiences you have a fresh start and a clean plate. You get to have a better life because youre going to be having a lot of things that you would want to master. Giving up is never the right thing because than you wont get anything you want. You have to work in order to get what you want because life doesnt give you anything for free. Many people want to grow and do other things so that they can master at it. Wouldnt it be cool if you were the first person to master anything you wanted? ",8,6,7,7,7,7,3396,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 8"

Teens can also, enjoy their summer vacation with their family by playing video games, watching movies, and go on a road trip. another reason, why teens should know that summer vacation is for them to enjoy, is that they can hangout with friends. teenagers hangs out with friends to go to a party, or to watch a movie. by hanging out with friends teens can do what they think is fun for them and their friends. For example, teens can have a fun time playing pool with their friends or just by going to a gym. In addition, teens can also have fun with their friends by having a sleep over or go for a camping trip. Lastly, on why students should know that summer vacation, is for them to enjoy, is that they are away from school, by being away from school students can have more time to have fun and do the things that are important to them. For example, students can stay up late and does not have to wake up early in the morning. However, teens can have more time in their hands, instead of having to learn. In conclusion, these are the three most important opinions, on why teens should know that their summer is for them to enjoy, by having more time for summer vacation, teens can enjoy more time with their family and friends.",7,7,7,6,7,7,3473,"conventions 7, grammar 7, phraseology 6, vocabulary 7, syntax 7, cohesion 7"
640,1012,8CDBA4104C7E,"Identifying a career in high school helps students prepare for their future. In some societies, students are expected to identify a career by the time they enter high school. Committing to a career as a young age its a good idea. First of all, identifying a career in high school help students to achieve their goals a little earlier. For example, if they start to study and be familiar with a specific career, they can graduate early. Meaning they might not have to spend 4 years in college, as everyone else. They can probably graduate from college after 1-2 years of studying for their particular career. Since they already going to have the knowledge from the courses of high school. Another example is, students can start to take their future in a mature and serious way. For example, those courses can help motivate students about wanting to have a better future. Meaning they can change their thoughts about not wanting to study for a career. And that theyre the ones responsible for their own things. It can teach them that having a career is that important thing that its going to take them somwhere in life. While some people think this is a good idea, some might not. Some people think that this is a waste of time. For example, students are going to have more things to worry about. Like studying more and passing extra classes. And this can cause for students to be mentally and physically tired. So they these people rather wait until college. However, waiting until college can be a little late because students arent going to have enough time to think about a partcular career they want. For example, once students are out to college, they need to have the career theyre going to study for. And if they dont, they could pick one that they arent really passionate about. Which causes more years in college, or them dropping out of college. And this can cause not having a great job, or future. To conlcude, committing to a career as a young age is a good idea. Its a good thing for students to do it because it can help them to prepare for their future. Committing as a young age help them to achieve their goals a little earlier, which is amazing. It can help them to know what to expect when they go to college. Committing as a young age for a career can help students in so many ways, and these are examples in the ways it can help.

The reason why I think that is because every one should be helping out the community . where we live is like a community that we need to take care of and not keep massing with it. If we mass up this world where will live, people just throw stuff on the floor, not picking after themselves. We should not be forced but we should do the right thing and be happy about it. People do a lot of things to help out the community, and we all should join in and help out like ever body ells.

642,372,B067F0CBE15C,"Having students take courses during the summer to graduate in three years isnt a great idea. The reason why I think it isnt a great idea is, students might need more credit to graduate, some students have jobs during the summer and could feel stressed workng and going to school at the same time, and students like to take a year break off school. First reason why I think it isnt a good idea is because, students might need more credit and need to take more classes. if they where to want to do it but didnt have enough credit they would have to double up there classes and doing that, can make them feel stresssed and pressured. Three years of high school isnt enough, in four years a student can join a club, play a sport and have regular classes and not feel over whelmed, and doing all that can make he/she look good when looking at what college to go to. But if a student wanted to do all that while having way to much classses could make them feel over whelmed. Second reason why, students have jobs when they start high school. We all people like to have money in are pockets and students get there money by working during the summer. But how can a student have a job and go to school, it gives less time for the student to do his hobi which is working. In the summer a student wants to work to save up for a car or for college, its the only time a student doesnt have to worry about school, they could just be focusing on saving up to go to a good college. Last but not least, at the end of the school year students like to go ahead and go to college but some might want a break to make money or think about what they want to do or just want a break of school. Having a break gives you time to work full time somewhere and save up for something you need like, a car, a house, or money for colllege. It takes time for you to be successful in life which is why you should take things slow and not make yourself stressed and tired doing everything fast. In conclusion, students who graduate in three years instead of four years, isnt a great idea. Students might need more credit to graduate, some might have jobs during the summer and if they where to take classes they could feel stressed, and some students like to take a year break from school and would want to be working making money for them to buy needs.

643,1758,F1A4167422E2,"I disagree with the fact that the school board wants to add an extra hour and a half to each school day. I disagree because many students might have something to do when they come out of school,they are also going to have to get used to a whole new schedule,and they might not have enough time to study or do their homework at home. After school many students might have something to do or attend. For example,students might have to attend a club, take care of one of their younger siblings, or maybe they have a job after school. If the school board adds another hour and half to a school day these students might have to miss the activity that they have or might have to change what they do. This is bad but what is even worse if having to get used to a whole new school day routine. They will need to get used to a different schedule or routine. Students will have to get used to much more longer classes and having to leave at a later time. Like I mention in my other paragraph sometimes students have things to do out of school,so they might have to change everything so that they will be able to attend or do what they need to do after school,For example,if they have a job they might have to change their job schedule so that they wont be late. This leads me to my other reason about not having time to do their work at home. Students might not have to time to study or do their homework at home. Think about it. By the time that students get home,eat,relax,and do anything else they do when they get home,they might end up starting their homework at a really late time. What if they have to study for a test,by the time they start studying they might only have an hour to do it. I know some people might say to their school work before anything else,but what if the student is not able to do their work right away. In conclusion The school board shouldnt add an extra hour and a half to each school. Although, many people might think that it is a good idea to have extended school hours. It would save a lot of time and work to just leave the school hours like they already are. And,their wouldnt be a reason to add an hour and half because students get a most of their work done in the amount of time they give them in the school day.

645,1707,CFBD5DD8ECFD,"Having shorter summer break can be beneficial for students to remember information. Although, some students enjoy having long summer breaks, but I think there should be year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. I believe it is enough for students to have 3-4 week break in summer because long summer break can make students bored and forget all information that they already learned in school. For example, in three weeks I can go to beach with my parents and friends. I can start my basketball practices, learn new skills, and be more active. Also I will not forget any informatin that I learned in school in three weeks. So this is the good reason that schools should have three week summer breaks. The second reason that schools should be year-round is because students can have longer winter breaks and celebrate the new year with their family. For example, one of my friend loves winter break and he always wanted to go back to his country and celebrate the new year with his family but he never got chance to celebrate the new year with his family because he didnt have time because of school. So having longer winter break can help most of the students to go to their country and celebrate the new year with their family. The last reason that schools should be year-round is because students can get a week off in every season of the year. For example I love to go out with my friends in spring because its close to summer and weather is very nice to spend time with your friend. Me and my friends always like to play soccer in spring because it is so fun and you can enjoy the weather while you playing soccer. In addition I can rest and sleep more during the weeks off in each season, so I dont get tired and get bad grades in school. In the end I agree with having year-round schools because students can have 3-4 week break in the summer, a longer winter break, and a week off in the spring and fall. So government should start thinking about these issues and make schools year-round. ",7,8,7,7,8,8,2862,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 7, vocabulary 7, syntax 8, cohesion 7"

647,1148,7FF600C1F829,"There are some young teenagers that already know a specific career they want to follow after finishing high school. Some teenagers have planned to go to college after high school and some have planned to start with a job. However, there are also some teenagers that dont have any future plans and they dont care about it. In todays societie, Schools expect students to identify a career by the time they enter high school. To help that, high schools offers many courses to help their students identify a specific career and to also guide towards them. Starting with the disadvantage of choosing a specific career at a young age. Of a young child, its dream career is to become a policemen or policewomen, firemen or firewomen, a actor or actress or even an astronaut. By the time the young child gets older, its interest changes in many categories such as their dream job. Starting as a freshmen in high school, students have a big and a open mind to almost everything and so they think they already know what they want to do after high school. However, after time passes, students will learn and experience new stuff in school and out of school, and they might get to know different intreset, and opinions of their friends and classmates. Those could change a young teenagers mind and interest easily. Therefore, some students will change their courses over and over again, till they final identified a career that they really like, and enjoy. However, some other students get tired of chasing a career they once dreamed of, that they change every school year and get lazy or dont care anymore. Another disadvantage would be that students only concentrate on their future careers and focus on their difficult classes they take, and this might sound confusing because, that is the reason why students go to school, however only focusing on work doesnt mean its healthy for a young teenager. Taking school not seriously is not the point here, however taking school work too serious ""For the good of the students future"" can cause serious damage in important relationships, such as the relationship between a child and his or her parents could be damaged because, the child has to much pressure on his or her mind and if his or her parents interrupt, a fight between parents and child would break out. Another problem would be that the young teenager will have difficulties making friends or has difficulties to talk to other classmates about anything besides school. During the teenagers free time, the teenager wont go out and play with his friends or maybe he doesnt have any and stays at home playing video games. Thats why some parents disagree with todays societies. The reason why is because, they dont like that the schools expects students to identify a career by the time they enter high school, saying that the schools should give the young teenagers time to experience and learn new things before they have to chose what they want to be in the future. However, not all students feel the same way as the other students. In fact, many students already know what they want to do after school and appreciate the opportunity to chose specific classes. Students can better concentrate on specific class to help them and guide them towards their dream career, of course there are other classes that have to be taken, in able to graduate however, students still have the opportunity to chose specific classes. Besides having a great opportunity to get helped and prepared for their future, is that young teenagers will have more fun in class that in regular class. The reason why is because, they will have more fun working on something that their interest in then working on other class work. Making friends will also be a lot easier, because the students in the same class will have the same interest and maybe the same opinion. Choosing a specific career that they want to follow, at a young age is big step, in fact its maybe a to big of step for a young teenager. However, there are also many young teenagers that already identified a career that they want to follow, it pretends on how the young boy or young girl acts, motivation and working speed. It would be better to give the young teenagers a little bit more time to think about the future and maybe to just let them experience new things and learn more about our societie, so at the end they have a clearer view on what is going on and what they maybe will be in the future, so they can better prepare themselves. However, the optional courses should not be change and they should be stay like that because, they are very helpful and perfect to prepare and guide the students towards their dream career. As we all can see there are many pros and contras to this subject that could be disgust and argued about.

I have other talents which are that I am good at sports like basketball ,softball,, track, and soccer. I been doing it seens I was little my dad wanted my siblings to be out of the house instead of being on our phones so we had to learn to do sports. The first one I learned is soccer because its just kicking a ball and running . The cool part about soccer is doing the tricks and everything. Soccer isnt big as well know as it should be. In the middle east its big but not like basketball or football the whole world loves those sports. Also in the England they call it football instead of soccer but I get it makes a perfect name for it because you just kick it with your foot. The second one I learned was track it wasnt that hard because you run or jump. When running in the track it is not about winning because the wind is in your face and running and your mind goes blank it feels so good when you are stressed. The long jump is my favorite because when I jump its like flying then I touch the ground and it is gone. That why running is my favorite its not about beating the other person. The other one I learned is I think it was basketball. basketball because it is a mystery if you make it or not you just shoot and hope you make it .Seeing basketball players on TV I think help me to be better just like them. The thing about is that the boys ad girls are separated because they think the boys are too rough for them the girls can be rough too but thats why they made the WNBA [woman national basketball assonstion].

In school we have softball but we dont have baseball for boys but I wish we did I think is unfair that the girls have one but they dont.

650,1662,F54386A8122B,"Today i will be discuss if it is a good idea for students to commit to a career at a young age? most may disagree with this statement, but i will hopefully grab your attention and hope you could agree with me. I think it is a good for students to decide on there career this early because number one in todays society everything is depended on technology. What are students into nowadays there phones, video game, IPads , computers, etc. So pretty high advanced technology is everywhere, My point that im trying to make here is that the majority of students get either there phones or computers at a young age. So in my opinion i think that there future is set way before high school. But again my point here is that yes i do agree that careers should be set when they enter high school. With entering high school students are introduced to a lot of programs at the start of there new journey to life. theres programs in high school that take students to colleges and take them on tours or they either tell the what to major on in that specific college, With planning early for your future you save time for stressing out last minute. I feel like this shouldnt just be small societies making students plan really early this should be the whole nation because as students we are the future of the united states so why not start 4 or 5 years ahead. Although some people may say that this is a huge distraction only because students would want to just focus on the future instead of focusing on whats happening right now. So the main argument is that I 100% agree with students choosing there careers at a young age. My main reason is that the early the better with chances of programs and guidelines to help you on your way to a better education theres no way that you can stress for a career. in addition to my statement I also think that schools should have a bunch of programs helping students out with there future that way they wont stress there last year of high school, and they wont have to apply to colleges not knowing what to do.

Electives can be helpful to students because it teaches them something new about the history of the different kinds of arts class and help them understand whats going on around the world and teach them how to play instruments and see where the origin is from and how it is played,art is teaches student s how to paint and make clay and shows who are most the famous painters,where they,d come from and how,d they became such great artists. drama shows who are the greatest actors,famous plays and how they became famous. Students say that an elective is better than it be a required class because its like having free time but you get to do something that you dont get a chance to do and it could be a career in the future for someone who is interested in doing it and sometimes the counselor puts the students into an elective that dont like and its not a required class and if they dont like it they don,t have a choice but to stay in the elective . Therefore students should be able to choose their own elective rather than it to be a required class that you need to pass in order advance into the next step of life and it will help them learn something in the future and remember what happened during their time in that they spent in that elective.

652,3227,7949A941BF0F,"What is success without failure? I can infer that the mentioned statement Prime Minister Winston had provided has an strong point of view from many perspectives. Human behavior mostly influences in their achievements and failures throughout life. To be able to achieved your expected goals without loosing enthusiasm, and demonstrating resilience is the greatest accomplishment. I strongly agree with the Churchills statement regardless to the critical role failure plays in life. It gives the enthusiasm every individuals need in order to be successful in life, it motivates young minds to follow their expectations, and provides more knowledge in many cases since we learn from our mistakes. Accordingly to many researches, individuals tend to give up when they are facing an obstacle in a complicated occasion, that prevented most of society to stop achieving their accomplishments due to the constant fear of experiencing failure. Society has been exacerbating this concept by creating irrational fear in those who are not willing to take risks to become better persons once they seemed to have failed, which leads to the mediocrity of the world. Furthermore, there are many people who were born in a extremely poor region, yet they became successful persons due to the hard work they constantly showed and the multiple failures they have experienced, that helped them work harder on specific goals, and that have made an enormous impact in many young minds since it exposes how someone could be able to achieved anything they are expecting, if you keep trying. If individuals were to give up in the first try, we would be a world with ignorant in it. Moreover, It is psychological proven that a brain can effectively works in better conditions, if they seem to be in a place where failure could be the main issue. We, as humans tend to follow others behavior to feel accepted by society. If we keep encouraging people to practice resilience, they would most likely be able to manage every hard situation in life and would have the courage to keep trying even if they are aware they might fail, in other words, they would be practicing negative reinforcement that is based on failing but being aware they could have rewards at the end. Overall, Failure plays an essential role in the pursuit of success since it gives individuals the challenge of becoming better human being and achieving their goals regardless to the situation. It exposes how human behavior react with the idea that success is not only one extraordinary idea. Success means being able to manage the situation with resilience and perseverance even if they seem to have made multiple mistakes. It influences in many adolescences, gives the hope of being able to achieved their expected accomplishments and it provides higher knowledge from their mistakes. A successful person is the one who have seem to dedicated their time to be able to greatly achieved their dreams.

653,3755,1B056DE0E856,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote "" unless you try to do something beyond what you have already master, you will never grow."" But i thing that when people work hard on something, even thou they all already don it, but they did poorly on it, So when they do it again thats haves them another opportunity to do it batter. For example when i was in eighth grade i had a lot of tribal how to spell in English, because i was from another country, could Generic_City. So all the time i could not spal a ward, so i will get sad, but in the minet or two i say to my self "" dont worry"" so to answer the cwesten that Author Ralph Waldo Emerson try to say, no i don`t believe that when people have already mastered in something they cant do it again. First, Work hard, people work very hard in something because they want to secid in the futurr. When some one bin doing something for so long even thou they did moltipal times. They can do it again, just to be batter ate it. They never hive up on something, because when some one haves up on something that they bin like in it, they will fail. Think positive about staff because when some people dont thing positive. Even no it`s hard for them to desalt what they what to do in the future but they did the same thing over and over, but when they work had and have that positive mind they will do it well . For example, my first year playing soccer on the high school teem, it was hard for me to understand what people was saying to be, but two three years later i had no tribal understanding what they war saying to me. So that shows that i speak English for three years and know i can understand what people saying to me because i bin spike net for three years. Second, Dont wary about staff, stay on track. People like to do something and finished, because when they finished it fills much better then before. When i take a test it makes me woride but when i finish it, it fills much better because my mined can relax form it. Even thou i still think what Caind of graid will get. Fist Complete the staff that is hard to do then do the easy staff later. When some people do their home work, they do the hard problems first and they do the easy staff, because it helps them to counchenteit on the hard staff first. When i have a problem that is very hard i will ask the teacher for help me with it, so that i can do the easy staff by my self. However, Some people ,like Author Ralph Waldo Emerson think different then the other people. for example when some one has a high school digry they just want to get out of school because if they did it again they will think that they will fail it. Most of the people like to finish something or accomplish something so they work very hard just to get that one thing like the pay check or college digry just to finish the last staff because they don`t want to do it. again because think that it will me waist of time. Some people look only for one thing but not the other. for instens that young man wants to play profashanal basketball, but he not thinks about school or nothing he just wants to play basketball and so when he tries out for a team and he never maid it so he just going to have up because he never grow to be a profeshanal basketball player. It dos it matter what some people do to, to be batter at something that they going to do it again but they will never grow. Therefore what Author Emerson try to say that people if the have already mastered ,you will never grow.

A talent or skill basically is something you are good at doing. Many people have the ability to move their ears, but some dont. Most people like dancing and are good at it, so it is a talent. Around the world, many people have more than one talent. My talent is to sing and write music. Some people in the world havent found their talent yet. One way to develop talent is to try everything. If you try everything, youll eventually find something you are good at. During this process youll probably be trying different things you havent done before, like sky diving. Even though finding a talent or skill might sound hard and take some time, it can be done easily. By trying everything you can find many actives you might be interested in. Soon, those activities might become a talent or skill. Sometimes by trying everything, you might not be able to find your talent, but you can always look at it another way. Trying different strategies can be helpful to find a talent as well. Another way to develop a skill or a talent is to make a checklist.

655,750,3E156DCB07C7,"We accomplish more when we are always doing something not when we are being inactive. There are many people out there who are most of the time through out their day are being idle and never doing anything, theyre always sitting around and wont do whats the best for them by trying to at least accomplish something in there daily life. Although some say being idle does not serve a purpose, actually being idle does serve a purpose, rather you should go out and accomplish something better for yourself. You might say being idle is not the good for you, but being inactive can sometimes be the best for you. Thomas Jefferson said that ""Determine never to be idle."" Thomas Jefferson doesnt realize that the reason being idle can sometimes be good is because you might not notice this, but in your daily life you can be doing to much for yourself to the point where you wont even realize how much you have accomplished. Once in a while you should think to yourself what you have done and accomplished during the week or day, it makes you think that you may need to be idle and put some time away from things that you usually be doing. What myself believes in is that you arent always going to be doing so much for yourself in your daily life on what you want to accomplish in. Sometimes you need to put it all away for a short amount of time and give yourself a break and just be idle for once not for such a long period of time, but make time to do your own things. One thing that is true about being idle is that it serves a purpose for being inactive, but the reason why that is good because you can always go accomplish it another time and you can come up with thoughts or ideas, for later on when you want to accomplish it. However, in my thoughts always being idle isnt good for you because you may have time to be idle, but you dont have all the time in the world to be idle. It would then just keep you away from doing things that you want to accomplish on, Which will then make your mind not want you to do things in anymore. In my perspective what myself believes in is that being idle for to long is such an impact on your life because when you take your time away from the things that you usually are always doing and have a daily schedule for it makes you forget what you had going on and what you were trying to accomplish in. Thomas Jefferson said that ""it is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing."" Which is true because you can get so much done if you are always doing, and it is wonderful like Thomas Jefferson said. Youre doing a lot of work and accomplishing it all by succeeding in the things that you need to get done, and its an amazing thing to do because you rather do it now then doing it at another time and put so much stress to yourself. In my opinion, accomplishing it at the right time is better than accomplishing it at a different time. To explain what my opinion said is, do it at the right time when you have the chance to do it rather than doing it at a different moment of the day. It will makes things much better for you because its better to get things over with now. You wouldt want to worry about it later on it would then just make things much more of a problem. Additionally, in my thoughts being idle keeps you away from doing the things you want to get done, it makes an impact on yourself on what youre trying to get done and it can distract you from your work. Something that is true is when youre are being idle, it keeps your focus on staying in the moment that are in which is doing nothing. An example of being idle is staying in bed all day on your phone. Why would somebody want to be doing that when you can be out accomplishing your goal and succeeding on what you want to become in life. Thomas Jefferson also stated that ""Determine never to be idle"" if you were to never be idle you can accomplish so much and keep on doing what you always do. People shouldnt let themselves get distracted by being inactive, they should take an advantage of all that and think rather than being idle they can be out accomplishing there goal and reaching for somewhere better. In my opinion, people should do more to get to where they want to be in their life because if people are doing that then youre definitely accomplishing something better for yourself. In conclusion, although some say idle does serve a purpose and should be accomplishing their goal rather than being idle. In my conclusion people shouldnt be idle because it will easily distract them from doing better things and accomplishing their goal, and it wouldnt be great for everyone. Once in a while people would get inactive way to much and just forget about what they have to do or accomplish in. Many believe being idle is good for you, but it can lead to a bad habit of you always being inactive and no want to achieve in your goal. In my statement idle does serve a major purpose in peoples daily life and can just keep them away from doing what they do. Some say people should accomplish more on always doing something and shouldnt get inactive.",5,6,6,6,6,6,800,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 5"
656,3414,263C2C01BC08,"I disagree with extending the school days, because is too much for the students and teachers, also not fair for teachers to work more them they do, and finally not that good because all the other schools are going to get earlier. Having not much sleep can effect students grades and classwork, This can effect teachers also just like the students. Students wouldnt feel that well with adding one and half hours to school, because they need to study and rest well. Adding all that time to school would effect after school activities, because students would not feel like they had much sleep or they did not study for something that is due for school the next day. Students would not feel well rested because they had to wake up at a early time and then coming back to school, after they come back from school students are looking forward for a nap but they cant because they have chores to do. Another thing is that students would not have time to do their chores that their parents told them to do, because they have homework or have to go to their soccer, swim or gymnastic practice. Adding one and half hours to school would affect the students a lot with activities and school work and also their sleep. One more thing this would effect teachers work because they have to leave school later then before. Also teachers wold not have much time with their family afterwards. Another thing is that teacher are going to have to work even more in their things for the classwork. It would also make it difficult for them because they are going to have to spend more time in school instead with their kids or family.

People wake up from the night sleep they had and having breakfast, getting ready for work, or heading out to the gym. But inactivity is a good too. In the of the day people sleep in the night or morning. Also many people need some rest to keep the same energy they had yesterday in the morning or night.

659,3344,42587039161D,Do you think technology is helpful ? I think Technology allows people to do many stuff and i think its postive because that way if you have to go buy grocery you can just go grocery shopping online something else why i think it is positve is because pepole can also work from home like lets say if you work in a offiice you can use your laptop so that is what i think about this. For example when my sister feels sick or does not have time to go grocery shopping she goes online and she gets her grocery deliverd in front of the house. Another reason why i think it is postive because lets say if you dont drive and need a ride you can download the app uber and get yourself a ride to go where you would like to go. Another reason is if you need to clothes shopping there is no worries because you can aslo go online and see what you want to buy if you dont have time to go in the store to see what u need you can always go online. something else is you do not have to go to the book store because you can read online and even check out books. you can bisically do everthing online pay your payments so many stuff these are some reasons why i think tecnology has been positve in peoples lives. Also another good reason is my grandma lives in Generic_City and now we can also facetime her from a diffreant country thanks to technology. One reason why it could be negative because if pepole order stuff and dont go out to buy somehting in the store they are not getting enougeh extracise and they are just being really lazy. Another reason why it could be a negative is nowadays pepole dont even talk face to face all they do is either text call stuff like for example when i go over my grandmas house for any holidays my cousins they dont communicate all they do is sit there be on there phones these are some negative reasons. So these are some reasons why i think technology is positive nowadays. Another good example is when i go to Generic_City or travaling anywhere what my older sister does is she checks us in so that way we dont have to wait in the big line at the airport and we already have our seats picked so that is also a good thing. like i said in the top paragraph in my postion technolgy has been really halpful for pepole. you can really do anything with your phone you can also pay with apple pay if you leave your wallet at home that is something you can do pay with apple pay. ,5,4,5,5,5,4,868,"conventions 4, grammar 5, phraseology 5, vocabulary 5, syntax 4, cohesion 5"

Once you start to see the downfall,or the bad things that have started to happen to you or the people close to you because of the decisions that you made, its time for you to go for to seek for guidance. Its best that you seek help before youre life falls apart. Guidance has helped a lot of people with their daily lives. The best part about it is that theirs no age limit for when you can and can not go. For example high school students have the privilege to go for guidance at school anytime they need it. One important thing that high school students are given during guidance is to always pick the classes that will help them in the future. Going for guidance should begin at an early age. When you start going, you get to understand the aspect of life and the decisions that you make as you move on with youre life. Its a great place to go when you have no idea of what youre going to do with you life or how to make the right decisions. The best part about going for guidance is that you are assured youll be talking to an expert;meaning that they are able to control themselves in any situation and talk to you in any circumstance. Most of the people who hold these jobs have degrees and are licensed to do that work. For most people,talking to someone the do not know is easier that talking to someone who they know. In this case its easier to open up to an expert who will soon give you advice and what to do next with youre life. After all maybe guidance isnt a good place to go. One of the reasons that people dont seek for guidance is that its too expensive. Most people can not afford to go for guidance every month or week. You need to have some form of income or at least be making a decent amount of money in order for you to afford it. The second reason would be, youre not really sure that the decisions that the experts make for you will be helpful. Its not always good to rely on what people say or when people tell you what to do with your life. In the end we are the ones who know ourselves better than anyone else does. In conclusion most of us still need help with the decisions that we make. We all make good decisions and bad choices.

668,1683,C8620D9D22DC,"I think by having older students with younger students would be helpful. Because older students can help the younger students with homework,projects and classwork. Older students how to do the right things that can help the younger students. To begin with, having older students can teach the younger students on what they need help with in school. This can be really helpful to younger students because with help someone that is older then you they can help you improve in school. Like for example my friend is one year older then me and helps me with school work when I need it. Older students can help teachers by help the students with classwork. Having older students in a program can be useful because they can show the younger students how to act the right way in class,and show others to do what they need to do. Additionally, younger students can look up to older students that they trust. Because they have helped them in school and having fun spending time with each other. Some younger students might think an older student can treat them as a sibling. Like for example I see one of my friends as a sibling because we have been friends since we where little and I trust them. So its good to look up to some one that you trust and count on and be their for you when you need them. Finally , I think having older students and younger students in the same program would be great. Because older students can show the younger students how to be right and do what your teacher tells you what to do. And parents want their kid to do good in school so they can have a good life to live. Having a mix of older and younger students can learn to do things together. By having older students it can effect the younger students to do good in school. In conclusion, I think its good to have a mix of older and younger students to be in the same program. This can help older and younger students to work together. And helping one in other is to help improve what they need help on. Like on homework,classwork,and projects to see what the need to improve.",6,5,6,5,6,6,2723,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 5, vocabulary 6, syntax 5, cohesion 6"
669,3287,063F809DE304,"Can you imagine how students will be so smart if they had extra help outside of class like an after school homework club. I believe that having an after school homework club is a good way to help students succeed. I will talk about how student will succeed from this, I will explain how they develop when they have a homework club,and my personal experience. Student will highly improve when they are in an After school homework club because student will comprehend even better while they are doing there homework with people that can help them. In my belief this is a good way to help kids not just with there homework but kids will improve on uderstading skills. they will learn how to learn things in a different way if they do not understand. Student will pass more tests and have better chances of getting to college and take this world in a good direction. I truly believe that helping kids with school work is the base for them selves and this world. Kids from k-12 will develop as they go . They can develop even better when they have help around them. Kids are bright and smart they have fresh minds and they can hold things in there minds. If kids can have the 100% help they will just be absolutely geniuses they will be better than the person that thought them. If kids can have academic growth 10% a year with out help imagine what they could do if they had a homework club where like I said where they can be talented. when I was in 5th grade, I was kid that loved math but I was not very good at it. So my teacher suggested for me to join the homework club after school. At first I was not happy about it but then once I started to go I loved it because I understood math even better I kept geting in the upper 90 with test scores ,I had the most lessons done on a math program that is called Think trough math. I became a student helper at the homework club and I am now a smart intelligent math student. when I get to high school I will volunteer at the homework clubs at and go help kids for my own good and because I love to help people. These are all the reasons why I believe that having an after school homework club is important to students improvements. I will continue to volunteer in helping kids academically . Like we all know youth is the future of this world. I truly believe there are so many kids out there in the world that need help and they are smart but they can not get it because there is no one that pays attention to it. There will changes to that may be not in my life time but I will do what ever I can to get kids from around the world education and help where they can develop and be the best they can be.

670,187,9702AD260172,"In this essay I will talk about how courses and daily life in high school influence the students to guide them and to think in a specific career. When students enter at high school are likely to get interest in anything and I believe their great skills they can show at high school, the support from their parents and think about their own future, is a good idea for students commit to a specific career at young age. The great skills that a student can show in any course say a lot. There are many students that have differents roles inside the high school. Some of the roles they play are in different environments. There are students that really like Fine Arts, Music Band, Chorus, Act, etc. However, students usually get interest to show skills in differents areas to be a professional like Masters, Lawyers, Bachelors, Doctors, etc. Actually, these careers are more convenient to students but also they need support. The most students gain total support by their parents and is a big priviledge. Nowdays, there are students that leave the school because they do not have enough support from their parents and this is a awful situation into the society. Students should be supported to do their job as students and not be concerned about any other stuff beside school. Parents have not to be just the supporters. All the school staff can also support students. The support is very import into society because students are future of the entire wolrd and I know we can make a change at worlwild. Think in a great and awesome future for us and new generation is amazing. For youngers students is easy to figure out what is necessary and what not. Thats why the world needs brilliant minds and leave a legacy that can make bigger differences. More culture, respect to the Rights, more opportunities of jobs, more health to everyone, feed to everyone, and a health and wealthy world are some needs students and people wish to live in good environment to everyone. In conclusion, students are guided and helped to think in a specific carrer by influnces like cources and lifetime in and out of the high school. The skills that a student can shows is simply awesome, they have great imagination. The support for students is in our hands, students have to be supported. The most important area is focus in their future as the best, doing big differences and doing a legacy. To be young is awesome.",8,6,6,6,6,7,1995,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
671,1887,E71DABB44645,"This essay has been written to take in consideration the advantages and disavantages of a four-day school week with each day considering to be ten hours which for some people it might seems to be a better way to conserve energy and resources. As a student I can say that I agree with this ""benefit"" but in this case I dont agree with making school two hours longer than usual for some students spending eight hours in school is consider to be enough becuase people get exhausted by spending most of the day sitting in a classroom. For example: in every classroom there is someone who is always sleeping during class due to the a lot of work school leave us to do, people who has work after school, and even sports. These reasons of why people gets to be too tired to stay up during class, imagine having to spend two additional hours in school just to have a three day weekend which might seems good but it really doesnt. Spending two hours more than usual for four days it just a way to still using energy even though people think they are saving energy but they really are not doing any better, lets use this as a example: the two hours we are using extra for the four day it still makes up for the eight hours we are losing for the fifth day of class. The extra two hours of Monday-Thursday sum to be eight hours that people still use the energy, which means they arent really saving energy Example number 1: my friend Generic_Name loves the idea to have a four day school because this means that he will have a extra day to do homework and to spend time with his girlfriend Generic_Name. For him this new programs works perfectly and is an advantage for him. Example number 2: My boyfriend Generic_Name loves to study but he does not agree with this new idea because he has sports to do after school for like about 2 hours of training for the basketball team in our school and then after that he works for 4 hours to help his mom with his car insurance which means that he wont get enough to sleep at night because after he gets home from work he has to do homework so we wont have to turn in it late. Like him there is a lot of more students in the same situation. Who does thing sacrifies to help their parents to make the payments. However, teachers opinion matter too and they will be tired of speaking ten straight hours too, remember that they arent robots who are just set up by the government. This means that they might not even agree with this new idea of making school loger for students and teachers. My school should not follow this model because they should think in everybodys benefits including teachers and students plus the staff of every department in the schools main office to make a fair decision for everyone in school. We dont know if this new adaptation will work in the schooling system which we dont have guarantee of this idea working well for us as a community. Consideranting that this program is working for some business that have adopted this new schedule might not work for us as a High School because here we have differents actitvities that the people in businees companies doesnt have, which make us a different environment than the business.

You learn from your experiences because your action, words you use or say, and your appearance can show exactly who you are. People agree with this statement because you can change your appearance, words you used and your actions. First of all, when you meet someone for the first time the way you act is important. Due to the fact that your actions speak louder than words is true. Your actions are things you can not change from your first impressions. When you start to act in front of somebody you just met, do not be mean or rude to them. If you do that they will think you are not a good person to be around. You need to make sure you do not mess up the first time. When you speak to someone you just met do not use bad words because if you do they will think you do not know how to talk to someone. When you talk ,you can use big words or just talk normal because no matter how many times you talk well to them you are gaining their trust. Make sure you do not mess up or stutter a lot I know you may stutter but you can always try your best not to stutter so much. If you mess up some people are nice enough to give you a second chance. Make sure you do not talk with your hands when you meet someone new. In addition your appearance is the most important thing of first impressions. Your appearance is something you can not change. Your appearance is the way you look on the outside and inside . People always focus on people appearance the way you act and the words you say but mostly on your appearance. When you have a bad appearance they will think you are bad person and they will not want to be friends with you. If you have good appearance they might like to be friends with you, but it depends on their first impressions too. If you like the way they act or the they talk or most of all their appearance. If their first impressions was good then you might want to be friends with them. Your first impressions are impossible to get out of your head and also impossible to change. On the other hand you might be able to change peoples minds. Some days you can have a bad day and other days you might have a good day. Some people appect that you are having a bad day and they know you are not like that. However, no matter what happens to you there is always a second chance at first impressions. To sum up some people say that your first impressions are impossible to change and people agree with that. The important things are your actions, words, and your appearance.

675,3572,A094036DE672,"I think that setting a curfew time for teenagers during the week and weekends is good because its letting them know the time they can leave there house, and the time they so there parents wouldnt worry about them leaving in the middle of night just to go out with friends. If there weekday curfew is until 10pm then its acceptable because its a school night so they at least just go home after school, change, and go out with friends until 10pm. If they get home after 10pm then they are disobeying, and breaking the law which would get them in so much trouble so like the consequences would be go to court, talk with the judge, and know what there punishment would be either going to be on prohibition for 2 weeks, having an ankle bracelet so if they try to sneak out it would alert an officer then they would immediatly would be put in juvenile detention center for a week, and if those consequences dont work then they would be offically be put with an officer to take him to school, home, and work so they dont try to sneak out again. The weekend curfew would be all day until 12am. this curfew time is only set only fridays and saturdays. If they come back home after 12am then there are gonna be actual real more serious consequences like being on house arrest, be on prohibition with an officer watching you, taking you to where youre supposed to be if any of those dont work then they will just be locked up in a Juvenile detention center for 4 weeks so they would actually have no freedom only time is when they get visitation time with there parents visit, and when they are released from that place.

676,3621,DBCAB09E41C7,"This is a good idea, and the educators should be agree with this. Summer Break should be more longer. We fell the summer is not enough time for us to enjoy the vacations. We need more weeks to rest and enjoy the beach and many things. I am agree with this people who think that the summer should be four weeks of break, and a long winter break. because during the vacation, we go to the beach, work, play with friends and family, visit friends or family that live far away or in other state, and sleep more. I think idea is great. Because during the period of the school we do not have time to go out. We only do homework, projects and many others things, and that is the reason that I like this idea because is the best way to enjoy the summer and have more time to rest. Winter should be more longer because during this season is very cold and dangerous, I think winter break should be more longer. Because Winter is a beautiful season of the year, but it is also a problem because during this period of the year, if people who drive do not take precaution they would have serious problems, and I think the school should be closed during this period, because the buses can slide on the ice, and can cause a big accident, and this is a risk, because many people can die. The educators should know this and think about. Because this is seriously, we have to be more careful during winter, many students come to school, buses drive over the snow, and this is a risk, I think this is a great idea why winter should be more longer, and more weeks of vacation, this days of snow should be make up on the spring. I think this is the reason why people think the Winter Break should be more longer because they know what can happen. They know the dangerous the snow it is, we all know that is beautiful, but can be very painful. This should be note by the educators and think the days or weeks break that they want to give to the students. In conclusion the educators should be agree with this idea, and think that we more weeks to rest and enjoy the summer. During winter take precautions because can be really dangerous, and we would have more time to do many things at home or might be work, and have more time with the family.

Students would have less time to practice from sports or other actives if theirs more homework and if they are failing a classes and get kick of the team if they play a sport. Students would be starving more if they dont eat breakfast, because they dont have time.

I belieave that people should relied on them selfs for two reasons. My first reason is that every one makes mistakes, and thats were we learn to not do them again. Infact when you make mistakes is better because you get to try again and you get to do it even better, there for to succesed in life you will have to fall, and get back up in to your feet to try again and do it better.

In conclusion its important that people learn to think and do things own there own so they wont spend money on others telling them what to do, and also not relied on somes help from others, some chooses are hard and some are easy but every choose you make, makes you up and shows who you really are.

683,327,44B06B4A6D7E,"Schools offer distant learning as an option for students who likes work from home, can there be good or bad benefits from working at home?. I think that working at home would not benefit students, reason being home is more comfortable and relaxing .Working at a public school can help you get opportunitys with friends or teachers like a job or college career. Public school is more efficient because, other students can help you out on work and at home no one is there to ask for help. Talking to a teacher in person can be so much more helpful then on a computer . Staying after school is a big benefit to people who prefer public school because you can get work done that is needed, but at home I feel like you cant get the same help you need on the work. Working from home can have its benefits like being with family more often. Working from home can be challenging for some people because home is more comfortable therefore the student would become more lazy and get bad grades. One thing about working at home is you would make your own schedule which could be flexible to your own time. Students who work at home would have no one to help them out with work outside of class which would be hard on the student Students who go to public schools will benefit more then the students that work at home. Public schools bring more opportunitys as distant learning would not get as many . This issue could be solved depending on the student, some students like to be at home and some like to go to public schools . Public schools help students with college information and helps the student choose his path in life. Working in a public school environment, helps more students do better in there classes makes them more productive.

Also help out is like if they need wood the students will give them. One way i think student should not work in a company is because the side effect is student wouldnt do their home work , they will not attend in class on time and they will not study at home. What if the student did dome thing wrong there parent have to pay for it or the school. If the machine cost 10000 that is expensive to afford.

686,1101,1E2B10DC7A53,"In my opinion, they shouldnt let students attend class from home. Students do not attend their classes will most likely to slack off. Although it is a great idea, only the truthful will attend classes from home while the other student will be in school. Students need to be in school to social and get out of their house, students shouldnt be in their bed listening to the teacher and being lazy all day. Student needs to be in school. From my point of view, students should be in school to socialist and need some fresh air. If a student stay home then theyll feel lonely, decrease their social skills, and be lazy. Due to this, students can develop some type of mental health problems if they stay in their house for a while, also some student who is in home will most likely skip school just to enjoy their day off. Teachers should know their students more. If a teacher knows who wants to learn then theyll most likely will focus on that student but if the student doesnt care then the teacher will try their best to help the student. Therefore all K-12 students should be in school and learn. Even though you understand my argument however, I think the trustworthy students should attend class at home. If a student shows respect and work really hard, then they would most likely to attend class at home if necessary. Although it is best if they attend in class but if they are sick then they are welcome to attend class in home as long they listen to the teacher and take notes. But if they are really sick or any emergency, than they should email the teacher to let them know. Students should always let the teacher know when they are not in school and ask the teachers permission to do a video conference. Without a doubt, students should be in school to socialist and need of fresh air, I do believe that everyone will be good in class and show respect to any adults. All student needs to be healthy in a physical and mental way. Students need to be in school in order to build their social skills because thats part of life, to socialist people if they need some assists or you need some assists as well. However, if theres a trustworthy student who work really hard may attend class in home. But if a student is awfully sick and in crisis then he or she will email the teacher that they are not in school and ask if they can do the work next class or in the morning and lunch break.

687,1780,F72B3EE2E414,"In some occasion you feel weary or oppress to think about that you have to take high school during 4-years when you know that you can do in 3-years? Some school districts are thinking is this wonderful ides to offer a programs to the students that they can graduate in 3-years, the school districts should be approve the idea to graduate in 3-years because it will be so helpful to the students to feel more motivate to graduate early, the students will use the other year to work and make money to pay some par of their career, and the students can enter and start college one year early . The students will feel more motivate to graduate early becasue many students that come from middle school they really took class of high school like Algebra 1, Geometry, Earth Science, History 1 ect, they can easely graduate and 3-years. I have two brothers older than I my brother that is 20-years-old he graduate in 3-years he miss only one class, but he take during summers because the school have the programs to high school students graduate in 3-years. Also some school districts dont offer this program to graduate in 3-years and the students lose their motivation to graduate and who want to go to school just for one class a whole year, what happed if a student miss only one class to graduate in 3 year,but the school districts dont have the programs and the student have to come for a whole year just for want class like my older brother that is 29-years-old he only miss one class to graduate in 3-years but the school from California did not have the programs to leave him graduate in 3-years it was so bad for him and a lot of students past the same thing. The student will able to use the other year to work and make money to pay a part of their career, we know that a lot of students dont have parents that can pay for their career because is a lot of money that they have to pay for a career, this year off will be so fundamental to the students who dont have the help enough to pay their career. During this year they can work and make money and have the opportunity to enter a college and be some one in life. The students who are a school dont have the time enough to get a work outside and pay their career through a work. This is why a lot of students who graduate from high school dont take a career because they dont have the money to pay it, or their parents dont have money to help them, I have a lot of friends and family who finished high school but they did not take a career because they did not have the money enough to pay it, and what happed if you want to take a career, but you dont have the money enough to take it. In some cases occur that when the student finish they high school in 3-years they start college one year early, or they start to work to make the money for it, they can finish their career more younger , we know that some career take like 6 or 8 years it will be so long , but have finish high school one year early will be so helpful for the students life. Some students feel weary when they are taking 4-years of high school, they dont even have time to think about what they want to be, which career they want to take. The students dont have the time enough and this is why some students take wrong career and is very harmful for their life. In conclusion, all school districts should be allow to offer the programs that high school students can graduate in 3-years, some school districts want the traditional four years, they think that is so helpful for the students, but they are wrong because the traditional four years cause a graduate decrease and many students go to school just for one or two classes, in the future if all school districts approve the programs to students can graduate in 3-years. Many students will be taking their career in college some one starting one year early, and other making the money during the year off to pay their career.

688,399,EC7A73638669,"Some school districts offer programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years instead of the traditional four years. I agree with this position. I believe that it is a good idea for students to finish high school in three years and enter college one year early. Although, some people think that it is not a good idea for students enter college or the work force one year early, nevertheless it can be helpful, because it can help students to start early to college, then they can have enough time to choose what they will want to study, and it also going to promote them to be eficients and take adventage of the time, they will have. When people have to take a important decision, regularly, they think and they look carefully at all their options. If the students graduate one year early, they will earn time to correctly choose what profession they going to take, and then they will have enough time to elect the college or university where they feel comfortables to go. This is significant, because of one decision depend the future; the experiences that people going to live. With enough time students can give attention to their most important interests, thoughts, and consider possibles changes if its require. Also people can take adventages of the time that they have, one year is not too much, but in one year is the opportuny for students to select a exceptional career and work and what they always dreamed. The time is a investment and students have to take advantage of that. Some parents, students, and techers think that if the students graduate a year early, they dont will have time free to play, to share with their families, or to do others activities. The reality is that it going to improve the performance of the students. This method will catch the attention of them and it will show them their priorities. The children have the right to have their free time, but also the parents have the labor to teach them that are precedences that they have to comply with. For example, I took English 10, in summer school in Generic_City, but I was living in Generic_City, I drove every morning, one hour to arrive to my summer school, it was hard wake up early and then drive, but now, Im sure that it was the best desicion because Im at few steps of my graduation. People always have to remind that to can get extraordinary rewards, people have to do extraordinary efforts. On the other hand, some people are not agree with those that offer the special program to graduate early. The opposition believe that students are not sufficiently prepare to graduate before of the schedule time. The contrary side, also think that students have to complete all their high school years to be ready to go to the college or the work. People that is in the opposite side not coincide with the programs that allow high school students to graduate in three years. In addition, some parents are not agree with the options that the program give to their children; to take courses during the summer or in the evenings. Parents refer to this like ""a extra pressure to students."" There are people that suggest that the better choice is that the students complete their four years of high school; however, it can prolong that time for students to graduate. To conclude, its important emphasize that in certain cases the pressure is a tool that help people to protrude in their projects and in the life in general. When people take risks and they have the courage to do reality their goals, they going to achieve all of them. The time that people invest in positive accions are transcedent to achieve their goals. The program offer a essential support to students, that going to be useful and it going to show to students that they have the capacity of achive their goals, before that they believed, they just have to establish their academic purposes and demostrate that they have the capacity to achieve it. The program is a great oportunitty to grow and success, one year can be the big difference, and it can approach us closer of that dream.",8,8,8,8,6,7,3453,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

You may ask "" Why is soccer a good activity to relax?"" well, when youre playing soccer you can get your mind off things.

692,1280,9FE2FE6E997E,"Thomas Jefferson wrote, ""Determine never to be idle... It is wonderful how much may be done if we are always doing"". Do we accomplish more if we are doing something, or does inactivity also serve a purpose? Keep doing something helps you get a chance to accomplish and also makes the time you spend out is worthwhile. Determine means you have reached a decision. Firstly, once you have determined yourself, you will know what to do forward. For example, you are having trouble with your weight so you are planning to be fitness. You spend two hours a day going to the gym or go jogging every early morning. As the result, you will lose weight and have a nice body. Secondly, determination can be a supporter for you to reach your goal. For example, you are a senior in high school and you want to graduate this year; however, you are having trouble with your grades. You try to improve it by asking teachers and you friends, or you go studying online and do some practices at home. If you do that everyday, you will get good grades and graduate. Determine can also make your time more worthwhile. Imagine after all the time you have to spend on doing something are now accomplished, you will feel very pleasant and proud of yourself. The more time you work, the worth time you pay. Otherwise, it can make you have more patience in life. You will not stop chasing on what you want to do although you have to face many problems in life. Therefore, you both get good accomplishment also a better personality. In the other hand, being idle in determining makes you are a useless person. You will have no job, no money, neither future. For example, you need to buy a house but you have no money. Instead of finding a job, you do nothing, which makes you waste time and get nothing for your benefit. Beside that, idleness will make you have no respect from people. Although people are working and getting success, you just sit there and get failure. It is not hard to determine what to do. Making lists is a way. It helps you analyze a lot of things to work on, makes you have more accomplishment, and you will become a successful person in life.",8,6,8,6,6,7,2140,"conventions 7, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 8, syntax 6, cohesion 8"
693,63,FA2DE7E82907,"Its has been saying people learn from their mistakes in order to accomplish a goal. Keep those mistakes out make them less likely to build self-esteem. True self-esteem come from achievement because is better point the mistakes in order to success. Point the errors keep student away to avoid do it next time, for example if a junior student is about to take the SAT exam ; he decide to practice math problems .His math teacher decide to check his work, and he think praise his work is good because make him feel less worried about the exam, but the truth is making feel better is not helpful because he is not gonna get enough knowledge about his problems. I could say he is going to feel much better with a high score in his exam. Lower the possibility to gain knowledge because the student in some point would have to use their knowledge it could be in college, at their job, and home. Like in my sophomore year I had a English teacher who praise most of my work because she thought that would in increase my knowledge, but was the opposite I felt like I was going backward instead of forward. I found praising a student work make them learn less in the way if they have something wrong students would have to look for answer, so that mean if they find what they did wrong is a chance of increase their knowledge because they might find more than just the answer that they are looking for. Student learn for their mistakes its much better point those mistakes out than hide it form them. Eventually student that dont show improvement are the ones that the teacher decide hide their errors because its better clear the doubt. Like a kindergarten student they asked a lot of question to the teacher, and most of the time the teacher correct their work to let them know what did they do wrong to improve their work. It would not make sense that the teacher tell to the all student that they know all the alphabet just to make them feel better, so the students could stop learning and focus in other activities like math, social studies, or even play. Praising is not good as we thought because can make us be okay with our work, and not encourage us to learn. while some may say praise student work could keep the working to make them improve and build self-esteem, actually student learn form their mistakes, and its better point it out than hide it from them because an error doesnt mean failure meant the student is improving to success. with the success comes the self-esteem.",5,5,5,6,5,7,3773,"conventions 7, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 5, syntax 5, cohesion 5"

695,2067,F90A6181BBCA,"In this world many of us make decisions by ourselves and others seek guidance to make decisions in their life. While some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life, but I think it is more beneficial if people make their own decisions because if people make their own decisions they will develop their self confidence and they will become responsible person. Also, if people make their own decisions they will have happier life in the the future. Its true that by making our own decisions that we will develop our self confidence and become responsible person. If person make decision that decision might be hard, after making the decision the person will develop his or hers self confidence and they will become responsible for the decision that they made. For example, if one person decides to leave his parents house to live by his own, he will be responsible for himself because he decided not to live with his parents no more. This will help him to be responsible person because he has to take care of himself by his own. Another example can be, In school, Students choose their classes for next year by themselves. This will help them to develop their self confidence because they are deciding what is better for them or not by their own. Also, this will help them to decide and have a confidence in what they will major in the future. So, by making our own decisions we can develop our self confidence and become responsible person. Secondly, Its also true that by making our own decisions we will be happy and have happier life. When people make important decisions by themselves and if they achieve their goal by making this decision they will become happy and they can have happier life. For instance, if one student decided not to go college, instead he wanted to become a soccer player. If the student worked hard and become a professional soccer player he will be happy and will have happier life because he decided to become a professional soccer player by himself instead of going college. Additionally, In school, When I was sophomore, I was choosing classes for next year and I decided to take classes that I thought that are important for me and that can help me for college. Then when I take the classes this year I was very happy of my decision because this classes helped me a lot. So, people should make their own decision because they will be happy and have happier life by the decision they made. On the other hand, some people argue that people should seek guidance to make decisions in their life because it helps them not to make wrong decisions, but I think that is wrong because if you always seek guidance to make decision in your life the decision that you made may not satisfy you in your future life. For example, if your parents advice you to make decision to become a doctor and if you made a decision to be a doctor by listening your parents ,in the future you might have bad life because being a doctor might not be part of your life. Also, you will experience difficulties in your life because your decision is influenced by others. So, people should make their own decision because it helps them to become better self confident person. By making our own decision we can gain a lot in our life. Finally, people should make their own decision because it will help them to develop their self confidence and to become a better person by being responsible. Also, by making their own decision they will have a better life in the future. People should make their own decision to become better person by achieving their goals. Additionally, peoples have to make a decision by themselves because they can gain a lot in their life. ",9,9,9,8,7,8,3745,"conventions 8, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 9, syntax 9, cohesion 9"

Students should offer public classes, however, Distance schools will make students careless by doing online or video conferencing. Distance learning is not good because it would make cheat easier, there would be less social interaction, and they would need to be highly motivated. Firstly, students would cheat easier. For example, If students allowed to use their technology system, It would be easy for them to do their work but It would be easy for them to go online to and copy the answers Some students have trouble working at school because they dont want to work. some of teens says that they cannot understand to work at school. Secondly, there would be less social interaction. For instance, when you are taking a test or taking notes at online school there are many distraction that can make students lose focus on what they are doing. Therefore, Learning from public school it wont have distractions that a online has. However, Students wont lose focus on what they are doing if they are only focus on their teacher and if they have questions, they can ask from their teachers so they would help them more. It would be more helpful if students come to school. Some students says that Online schools have more highly motivated. For example, one of my friend, she used to come to school, but Furthermore, she stop coming to school, because her teachers wont helped her, she cannot understand well, she got bad grade, and she fail all semesters then she plan to start online school. she got the answers the error words which she didnt know. However, Online school are have much more opportunities than the public schools. online schools have more distractions on what you are doing and get more free time. In conclusion, students should offer to attend classes because attending to classes are less stressful. Students get more help from teachers. there would be less social interactions, because they wont be distracted by any technology and would be focus on studies. Some students are more interests in online schooling because they get more free time and get more rests than the public schools. I think public schools are more helpful for everyone because you meet new people, learn different experience, you get new ideas from others, and it wouldnt make you stressful.

Some people believe that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers while others believe that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. This is important because is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekday curfew for teenagers. This is going to help teenagers how to be responsible, get a job, and learn how to take care themselves. First, teenagers have to learn how to be responsible because some teenagers do not grow up with their parents. For example, they have to go a school in the morning, and they have to go a work at night. This is important for teenagers who work and study hard. That is why is not fair that the city council debating the adoption of 10 P.M. for teenagers because they do not have some else to help them to pay bills or other stuff. Additionally, most of the teenagers have a job at night because they want to go to the university. For example, teenagers only have time to have a job at night, and they help their parents to save money. Their is a lot of teenagers who really want to go to the university and universities are expensive. This is a big effort for teenagers that they really want to reach their own goal, and their parents do not have a lot of money to cover the bill of the university However, not everyone agree with this position. Some people claim that debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight weekend curfew for teenagers. Nevertheless, teenagers are going to learn how to take care themselves because their are not going to live with their family all the time. For example, some teenagers take the decision to move to other state or country. And it is a good idea for them how to take care themselves without parents. Based on this argument, one must conclude that is not a good idea to debating the adoption of a 10 P.M. weekday curfew and a midnight curfew for teenagers because this have to be an option for teenager to do what they really want to do. Some teenagers are responsible for they own self, this help them to be prepare for their own future, and be a teenager who can protect their self in a earlier age. This is gonna help teenager to maturity.",8,7,8,7,7,9,820,"conventions 9, grammar 7, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 8"

That the enthusiasm is it the most important to any business or personal in your life consist in that simple word. First I think that prompt has a specific message that persuasive that everyone who read can reading the message. So if who read the prompt may perform their success and should not failure in the future business. Next the futere business can thinking about it. Then if they dont have any enthusiasm they wont have success in a not very far away future. Finally that is what I think about the prompt said Churchills statement very important role that failure plays in the success. First I think it is very important that statement role that failure plays in the pursuit of success. Second if you persist and never give up you should be successful. Also if you are not persisting what you want with enthusiasm. That means you will have the same situation going to failure in your live. Then finally never loss the enthusiasm that is the point for all success. For the success if you are unwilling have a little enthusiasm. So, as you are trying to do and you fail. Its only one reason that was not enough enthusiasm to doing it. You have to preform and trustly in yourself. Also I think that success is for who are looking and persist with enthusiasm. Finally that is the enthusiasm consists in the future. The important role from failure to failure without loss of enthusiasm. I am agree with that statement said, you never think you cannot do anything. Also I think if you feel without enthusiam you always will failure. So if you purpose is the success you should hard work and dont feel you cannot. Then if you willing you wont failure.

But does everyone create their own characteristic traits or are they influenced by those they surround their selfs with.? John Lubbock, a British naturalist and politician wrote, ""Your character will be what you yourself choose to make it."" I take a position on representing that you are in control choosing and creating your own character. In building your own character its all in your mindset. Mindset takes a big part in someones character because it shows what kind of person you are and how you represent your self and how you portray things in life. The way you think has an effect on you as a person and how you betray things in life. It also takes part in who you surround yourself with. Do you surround yourself with people who have goals in their life or inspire you to become a better you.? It also takes part on things you choose to do and say on a daily bases. The decision you make could lead into something better or for the worse in current situations or in the long run. Having motivation and a goal in the your life builds you as a person and sets you for growth. When you see someone in your life not doing well and not in a good current situation you want to avoid being in that position. But when you start seeing someone in your life doing better things and living the life that you want to accomplish, its on your part to doubt yourself or make that you motivation. When you strive for something in life and start working hard for it, your mentality starts to change to do better and get to your goal. Some may argue that the people you surround your self with is beyond your control on how your character traits are formed. Yes the people you surround yourself with everyday might have an effect on your characteristics, but it isnt beyond your control. You can have something to motivate you to be better then who you surround your self with. You have control over your thoughts and how you see things in life. It takes part on you and what you strive for in life. In conclusion, Your own character traits are somethings that come within you and how you portray life.

If managers give students the opportunity to visit their occupations,students who work hard wont lose that excellent opportunity,and managers would have an amazing great roll in students achievement which I know it would help the company.

Companies should give me the opportunity to explore and visit their occupations because I would have a great experience of the excellent opportunities that they may have,for example,my mother always tells me a story about how she became a lawyer,she said that as a student,she was preparing herself for the future,thanks to school,they gave her a chance to explore and get some knowledge about lawyers in a company called ""Everything is possible,if you believe it""she had the chance as a lawyer to meet the president,also there is a story about her in the internet,she became a lawyer because she had the opportunity.

Summer break is the only long break that the school gave to the students to do all the things that they couldnt do during the school year and they can rest for a long preiod. I dont agree for these reasons: First, A lot of students wants to work during the school year or do other things that take more time to do, but they cant do it because they got too much homework or they need to study for a tests that they have that week and they just had time for that. So in Summer break they got 3 months so they can work and do more things that they couldnt do during the school year. Students can work and have more experiences that can help them when they want to apply for another work that is much better for them and learn more things. Next, Students needs a break after the school year. Most of the students get stressed for all the works and tests the teachers gave to them, their brains needs to relax and rest for a preiod time because its not good to be always working, they got tired too. So Summer break is the best period to relax and distract for a period time. Students can go to the beach and have fun, Enjoy more time with their famillys, hang out with their friends, go visit new places, too much things they can do in this break and the weather is perfect too. Finally, In Summer break the students dont worry about works or tests they may have need to present when the break is end. When they have Fall, Winter or Spring break the school gave to them just one week and in that week most of the teachers gave to the students works and tests they need to make after the week breaks, so in conclusion they dont have breaks because they need to study or do works that the school gave to the students. In Summer they dont need to worry about that and enjoy the time they got. Some persons may dont agree with me because they think that have more breaks during the school year is better for students, but they need to know that the students got works during that breaks and they need to study for tests that they need to make after the week break, so in summary, they dont got that time to relax and give a time period to their brains so they can rest. In conclusion, Summer break is the only long period that the students got to relax and they can do so many things that they couldnt do during the school year because of all the works they got and test that they need to study for.

704,2331,D129F19FF7F7,"People should make their own decisions to avoid bad guidance from other ""experts"". Everyone should make their own decisions because they know themselves better, they know what they like and what they want, mentally and physically. For example if someone bought someone else something that they didnt like or didnt want and is the total opposite of what they needed, they wouldnt have sent the other person to go get it in the first place, now would they? Also, people should make their own decisions so that they could learn from their own mistakes and their misjudgments. For example, people buy the wrong size of clothing online everyday without trying it on in stores first. People will now know to go in stores first or to get themselves measured first before ordering clothes online. Another example, is that people look at something they think is interesting and nice, but wont read the directions or the descriptions that come with it and once the package that they got or ordered it at their homes and in their possession is either not like the picture or is smaller then what they thought it would be or is just one piece of what you ordered. This is a great learning experience for them to not do it again and to always read the descriptions of what youre ordering comes with. Lastly people should make their own decisions because not all ""experts"" can really help you with your situation or not even do so well on your case. For example, people can pay a lawyer a huge amount of money for them just to fail on your court case. Another example, people pay to see a doctor for something they think is wrong with them because theyre hurting badly and doctors will say youre perfectly fine and prescribe you an expensive pain killer, which people can already have at their homes. Last example, a therapist can also prescribe you medication that you dont need but will still give it to you because they can. Some therapist dont believe in that but most do. So therefore, these so called ""experts"" sometimes dont know what theyre doing or sometimes they are trying to make money out of innocent people or even sometimes is it always okay to make some mistakes and learn from them and your misjudgments. So it is always better to make your own decisions to avoid bad guidance from others.",7,7,8,7,6,6,2887,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 7, vocabulary 8, syntax 7, cohesion 7"

Student can""t really get it they need some one to be beside them in tell them or teach them I really wonder if there were only one student or a lot because is program but if it was only one person they really can concentrate that really good because there a lot lot if there was more than one person it fine because it will be more help that the main effect if there was only one person in not a lot of them in was a big problem with then.if there were talking to much it was big problem for the program. 5. paying attention is really good thing so the student can really get the work they can get in learn what they do. The most important is if the young student get it if they dont get it they will fell the test because the older one properly know but can explain can find the easy way so the student can understand it really understand it good they really more information how to treat the student in explain it good make sure it good to them make sure not to just yell at them you have to have passion. talking with some one like your age understand it all of us have different kind of ways to explain it in to learn it. Like me I understand it with a adult like PROPER_NAME that one my teacher i can listen to him but some with younger them me or alder them me.

712,1427,1C17939C40A7,"I really like this quote because, i believe this is a problem that basically happens in many homes and also many society of people. Being motivated to become what they dont want to be and what you dont have the passion for. Therefore i disagree with Emersons statement; Why? Becacause i believe everyone has a choice to choose what they are passionate about, not what the society or the influenece of their parent saying I see a doctor or an engineer in you. Having the love for a profession or a study is one of the greatest thing ,you feel like you are living everytime you figure something out,you feel happy and motivated to take it futher to you reach the top. When someone is passionate about a profession,studing of a language,writting,discovering,healing,helping people,anything in this world i believe they should be motivated. Not brought down by making them do something else because its not healthy physically or mentally i believe. An example is ME.I have studied business almost my whole like since i was in my country,beause i wanted to be work in any field of business. Last year i moved to the united state and my parent and everyone around me said i should be a nurse,but i dont have the passion for nursing,but with no support on my side i decided to be nurse,and mentally i feel like ita going to be difficult, and i always bring my slef down when i thing about it, but if it was something i had the passion for i wouldnt mind the hardness i will just concentrate on how i will make it and and believe in myself that i will surly get and will also be very determined. Thata what i mean by being motivated and supported to do what you want and do what you love is really great. So i disagree with this quote,some people will agree because they believe your society or your surrounding makes you who you are. But i believe the society and everyone around do not make you,or can not stop you or influene you to do the opposite of what you want to do unless you give them the chance like me or you take your stand and let them know why you want and love this thing and it will be a great honor if you accomplished it .

713,436,FA078892658B,"It is true that keeping teenagers out of trouble is important for many reasons. If regulations that require teenagers to be off the streets after 10 pm are adopted then they will help teenagers academically, socially, medically and economically. The first reasons that proves that these curfews will help teenagers and keep them out of trouble is that if teenagers are not allowed to be on the streets in the middle of the night , then they will get more sleep and will learn more efficiently when they are school. For example, if a teenager is not allowed to be on the street during the middle of the night, then that individual will get a good night of sleep and will be able to stay awake during classes. Also, if this regulations are are adopted, then they will require teenagers to stay at home longer, which will help them because they will have more time to work on their homework and if they do their homework then they will improve their grades. Furthermore, these curfews will help teenagers improve their learning skills and will also help them rest more and get their grades up. The second reason that shows why these curfews must be adopted is the one that will allow teenagers to socialize better. For example, if teenagers are in the streets in the middle of the night, then people will not want to be close to them because they might think that they are bad people and that they are probably involved in gangs, so they will be scared of them. Many people will agree that it is better if teenagers stay at their houses during night hours because if they stay at their homes doing good things, then they will make more friend, socialize and communicate better with people because no one will be afraid of them and no one will think that they are involved in some criminal group. So, if teenagers keep themselves out of the street during the night, then they will be able to make friends, communicate better and basically socialize in a better way in which no one will try to avoid them. The third reason that proves that these curfews must be adopted is the medical reason. If teenagers are in the streets during the night, then they have the possibility of getting in fight and ending up with injuries. For example if a teenager is out during late night hours, then others might think that he or she is there because hes a bad person and then they might get into a fight in which someone could get hurt and end up in the hospital. These curfews will prevent teenagers from getting into fights and from having to go to the hospital when they can just stay at home and be safe. The last reason that will keep teenagers out of trouble and will help them is the economic reason. For example, if a teenager wants to be out in the middle of the night, then that individual can find himself or herself a job that will allow him or her to work during night hours, keep him or her out of the streets and help him or her economically. Economically means that the person will be working, earning money and also staying out of his or her house during late night hours. Teenagers can improve themselves economically if they spend their time working instead of spending it in the street doing things that will not help them in anyway. Finally, by working and improving their economy teenagers will be able to save some money for their own future and have money available for emergencies that can occur throughout their lives. Furthermore, it is better that these curfews are adopted for the security of teenagers. Also because these regulations will help teens improve themselves economically by keeping them out of the streets and motivating them to find a job if they want to be out of their house during late night hours, they will also help them socially because people will not be avoiding them if they are not seen in the street, medically because they will prevent them from getting into fights and having to go to the hospital and finally academically because teenagers will not be wasting time on the streets and they will have more time to do their homework and improve their grades at school.

715,1002,61445D1ABF16,"One...two...three...START! Identify an enjoyable educational activity such as doing the science fair, singing, playing an instrument and many others. In my opinion, the most enjoyable educational activity is art because it makes me less stressed out, I could find new styles, it could be my future career. First of all, it makes me less stressed out about everything. Whenever I take a test, I will start to over think a lot and loose concentration. Most of the time, I will always doodle on my paper because it lets me concentrate more and loose my mind a bit. I mostly take a break whenever Im taking a test just to calm myself down a bit and doodle. Personally, I took the SOL yesterday and I mostly doodle half of the test because I was over thinking too much. I was stressing out really bad yesterday and I just doodled on my paper. I always doodle on my notes, my work, and my test because its really fun in my opinion. It helps me a lot and make me concentrate more often now by doing a simple thing like doodling. Second, I could find new styles in my art. I am a self-taught artist and I like trying out new styles. Its very interesting sometimes and very fun to do. It may be really complex for me but I still try my best to get the hang of it. In my opinion, it is really creative and it may also shows your feelings about life. I could draw how its like to be scared of the dark or being scared of heights. One of my friends have sleep paralysis and most of the time she draws about how it feels like to have sleep paralysis. It very amusing to me and interesting because it can tell a story about my life. Additionally, it could be my future career. Since drawing is my favorite thing to do in life it could be easy for me to get a job that deals with art. There are many art programs in college and Im mostly interested in doing animation. Animation is very complex sometimes depending what type of animation am I doing. There are two main types of animation, 2D and 3D animation. 2D animation is more like a picture and many cartoons use 2D animation. 3D animation is more realistic and its a lot more complex than 2D because you have to model objects, humans and many others that I could add. 2D animation is more like just drawing on a piece of paper while on the other hand, 3D I had to mostly use a program for to just do 3D animation. Most of the time it is hard to find a job that you want and it takes time and hard work to get it. Mostly my future job would be an animator since Ive drew so much in my life. I love doing art because it makes me less stress out about everything, I could find new styles in art, and it could be my future career. Art is mostly my favorite enjoyable educational activity in school and many other places. It is very enjoyable in my opinion and it really helps me through tough times in life. It could be very hard sometimes but it is still fun to do.",10,9,10,8,8,9,1268,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 10"
716,975,47006CCC27EC,"Break out of comfort zone. life is boring without expanding your horizons. no growth. have to fail to learn a lesson to move on. learn more from failure than success. If never try something new, youll never know if you life it or if youre good at it. real life experience. Helen Keller Michael Jordan After mastered basketball, he want to baseball. Cant stay at tee ball , have to practice to get to actual baseball. Emerson is therefore correct in stating "" Unless you try to do something beyond what have already mastered , you will never grow"" because to grow one must break out of comfort zone and failure leads to success. Failure lead to success, comfort zone knee jerk reaction, ""well I havent mastered anything yet so I cant adequately answer this questions"" Generic_Names example wants to mas painting. Opposition, mastering something is impossible scientific theories disproved got to school for 12 years, still have not learned everything therefore Emerson is wrong. Also, Ralph Waldo Emerson Wrote, ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow"". This quote by Ralph Waldo Emerson states if people do not go beyond what they have already accomplished. They will never progress in life. Some peoples initial reaction would be "" I have not Masters anything, so I am unable to respond to this question."" There are a couple reasons why Emersons quote is correct. Growing requires breaking out of comfort zones and broadening horizon. If a person does not go beyond what they are capable of archiving they will not grow. Failure assists to growing and learning to lead to success. If people never expand their horizons, the they never experience new adventure life can offer. Without the thrill of a new experience, life would become aborning repetition of activities we have already mastered. Therefore, to break out of a comfort zone, people must go beyond what we have already mastered. One day at school, our band class attended a piano recital put on by Generic_School students. Even though, I was not part pf their piano class, I decided to perform unannounced. As I walked upon the stage, a my emotions flooded my body, such as nervous, anxious. However, to become a better piano performed, I needed to step out of my comfort zone and perform for entire piano and band classes. Just as Emerson said humans must go beyond a mastered trait, or comfort zone, to better themselves and not miss possible opportunities.

717,135,293A93F037A7,"I agree with Winston Churchhill because without failure how can we be succesfull in life. Frist, reason why because If you fail at something you can reflect on it. Second, failure can make you become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. Third, Is never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. You can always reflect on somthing you fail at, and become better. If, you dont study yourself at something you failed at, then you cant become successfull. For example, say you were playing a football game, and you missed your tackle in the game. After the game you watch the film, and see what mistakes you did wrong. After you seen what was wrong in film. You studied the film, and trian harder in practice for next game, so that wont happen again. Another reason you can do after you reflect on yourslef is practicing at something you love to do. For example, riding a bike for the frist time without trianing wheels. If you fail at riding a bike, then you have to practice, so you can become better at it. In order to practice you have to reflect on it frist. After you reflect what you did wrong, then you will become better when you practice. Failure can teach you to become better then you were yesterday if you work hard. For example, you went to practice for a 100 meter, but you did not wram up at all. You decided to run the 100 meter for the frist time anyway. After you finsh the 100 meter you didnt feel good about the time you had. The next day you decide to warm up, and work harder to get better results. After your trianing you wanted to run a 100 meter. When you ran a 100 meter you felt better with your time, and decided to work harder everyday to become better then you were yesterday. This is how failure is making you better because it is teaching you that if you fail at something, you can always pick it back up, and become better, then what you were doing that day when you failed at something. If you want to become better, then you were yesterday. Then dont worry about the past because thinking about it all the time will bring you back to failure. For example, say you are mad that you lost your 100 meter race in fourth place. When you lost, you keep thinking about it all the time, and cant move forward for the next race. When the next race starts the day after you lost. You lost the race again in fourth place because you keep thinking about the race you lost in the past, then thinking about how can you can become better then you were yesterday. The point is in order to become better you have to think how can you improve better for the future, then thinking about how you failed in the past. Never let failure consume you. Instead use failure to lead you to success. For example, say you have a math test on Monday, but you decide on Sunday to not study for it because you think the test is very easy. On Monday you give up on a math test, and decide to fail it. The reason why because you did not study, and it was too hard for you. You decide to retake it on tuesday, and learn from your mistakes. On Tuesday after you failed the math test. You took the test again to get a better score because you studied very hard to succesed in the test. This is why you always use failure to lead you to success. If you let failure consume you, then you wont reach to the top to become successful. For example, you cant swim at all, and your drowing. For some reason you dont wont to reach the top because you are depressed, and want to give up. In conclusion, I still believe It is impossible to be succesfull without failure. Without failure we cannot reach the top to be successful. Without failure we cannot reflect on things to become better. Without failure we cannot become better then yesterday. In order to become successful we have to use failure to lead us to success. Its okay to fail because after you learn from it. Everything is going to be okay when you overcome it, and be better.

718,401,F4F054797227,"I believe that people yes should make their own decisions and follow their instincts because that is what make us different from others. Follow your intincts and what you think that it is right can make a big change in what you are and what you want to be. First. People need to believe in themselves and do what they think that it is right. Sometime we are afraid to make ours onw decision because we think that is wrong or because what others can think about us. But just think about, all the things that people had been invented along the time. What would will happend if they did not make their onw decisions, nothing that what we have today will not exist. So do not be afraid to make your onw decisions because others. Is not bad to look what other had been done and see if what you are about to do can be good or not. But always follow your ideas and do your onw work. The instincts is a natural aptitude that human have, is something that make us do things without a well reason. The instincts make us do things that we think are right because a felling that we felt. No matter, sometime that felling can be rigth or not. But sometime bad decisions teach us what we do wrong and learned how do it better in a future. people should follow their instincts and ideas because that is what make us defferent. Learn of what we do wrong make us a better person. Poeple always are going to judge you and talk about your decisions no matter if are good or bad. So do not let others stop you and doing the things that you believe are right. The decisions that we make today can harm us in the future. That may be is right, but if we always are thinking about what is going to happend. we never are going to know what is really going to happend. So make own ours decisions can make a big change ir our life for good or bad. It is important to listen to experts because can be helpful in what you are abuot to do. But always do it because you want to do it, not because other tell you. Always do may make you happy, no metter if you are wrong or not because that is what is going to make the difference.

Always do and follows what they believe and think carfully and what they want and where they want to be.

720,3680,6F9741277AB3,"People should make their own decisions instead of seeking guidance from experts or authorites about lifes important matters. I personally know that making your own decisions is better then other people making your decisions because if a expert or other person did, they could probably decide something you dont want and then regret it later in life. One reason why i know making your own decisions is better then seeking guidance from experts is becuase when making your own desisions you know what your doing but you have to think twice about it and then go with it. Like for example, if i chose to take geosystems instead of physics i think about it twice because i know what could be the bad thing and the good thing about that class and then go for what i think is better. Second reason why i know making your own decisions is better because when a person makes a decision they made, then later regrets what they chose, they made a mistake. Thats a good thing because learning from your mistakes helps you a lot and benefits the wrong and making mistakes will make you a more successful person. For example, if i were to take an exam then get the results that i failed because i got a really bad grade i would try again but wouldnt give up which makes me successful. Final reason why i know making your own decisions is better because who else in this world can? Its your life and theres never gonna be a person right by you telling you what do and what not to, so they have to learn by their selfs becuase no one is. For example, what if i said i wanted to go buy a house, who should i ask to make my decision? no one because you make your own decisions in this life.

721,3412,E31B2A06C28C,"It has been said that a positive attitude is the key success in life, that having a good thinking about what you do, and be proud of it is important. Well, in my opinion it is the only thing, because time is going forward, and not backward, things that you have already done cannot be changed, but by having a good attitude about it you change your future, like being successful in your goals, solve economy issues, and even in day to day life. A positive attitude is really important when it comes to achieve your goals, if you want something but you think you can not make it, it is because you do not have enough attitude, in order to be successful with it, you must forget all the negative thoughts, and believe in yourself, and after all the effort you have been giving you will be a little bit more closer to achieve your goals. Sometimes money can turn your life real hard, it can make you stop trying for what you want, and make you give up; is in this kind of situations when a positive attitude must come in, let me give you a personal experience: I used to live with a stepfather, my mom, and five brothers. At that time bills and debts were easy to pay, my stepfather was making around $3,400 dollars a month, my mom like $1,300 dollars a month, and my brother and I around $800 dollars a month, all these money was the house income, but after my mom and her ex husband divorced, everything changed, now we had all those bills on us, but because we did not give up, and we had a positive attitude about the situation, we started to work even more, now my mom is single, and we can make trough out the month. Another good example is living every day with a positive attitude like at work, at school, at home, even restaurants, it does not matter where you are right now it is important to always have a positive attitude, it is crucial in life to be proud about what you are, where you are, how you are, be the one who makes the change. Some people say that because you did something wrong in the past, it is impossible to make a change about it, but they are wrong because they might not able to change the past, but for sure they can change the future by fixing and understanding in what they have failed, the attitude is important be proud of everything you have done and do not be ashamed. In conclusion, it is really important to have a positive attitude because to be able to achieve your goals you must have to have a positive attitude, money can make it hard for you to live, but you have to think and analyze the situation, wherever you go remember to have a good attitude about yourself, and never be ashamed about something you did wrong remember that you always can make a change, only if you have a positive attitude.",6,6,6,6,5,6,3269,"conventions 6, grammar 5, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

723,3631,AC8331539332,"""Do we choose our own character traits, or our character formed by influences beyond our control?"" I think you should be you own character because not everyone has good intention in this world, and most people love seeing other people at their lowest just so they can feel good about themselves, or be proud of themselves so that they prove something and they can say that theyre more successful than you. Thats exactly why you shouldnt trust everybody thats around you. Its okay to communicate or socialize with people every now and then but dont put your 100% trust in them because its always that one person that you wouldnt expect to betray you and really will. People are good at hiding their true colors. You shouldnt let people influence you in any type of way, be yourself and have confidence in what you want to be in life, after all its you life not theirs. For example, if your parents wants you to be something you dont want to be, dont to it because again its your life not theirs. I understand that thats you parents but live your life and just have faith and trust yourself. You shouldnt be acting like someone your not, a lot of people act certain ways or try to be someone theyre, usually in a relationship because they are scared that the person theyre with is not gonna like who they really are, or they might be ashamed because they think that he/she might judge them if they really show who they really are, but honestly why be with that someone if they cant accept who you are? Shouldnt you question yourself, why are you even with that person in the first place, if your even thinking that they ""might"" judge you in any type of way. Sometimes its okay to think though just take a minute out of your day and think and you can actually realize a lot of stuff about people and especially how theyre acting towards you. Thats why I dont let people influence me in any way because you never know what that persons intentions. be your own person and dont ever be someone yourre not, and you should never change for someone just cause they dont like you for who you are, your friends and your family should accept who you are and respect your decision. Sometimes it takes time to see whos really there for you but one day you are gone see who are really there and support you in every step. For example, if your friend dont respect your decision making to something that you wanna do then you should know or question, are they really friends or are they really there for me? because people come and go. My point in all of this is just be yourself, trust yourself, have confidence what you wanna be and dont let somebody take control in your life or dont get influenced by people that dont have good intentions in you, basically make the right decision. Dont try to be perfect for somebody elses, if you wanna do that then do it dont do it for somebody else, do it cause you wanna do it. But, I agree that you should be your own character , because you cant trust everybody or expect everybody to have good intentions in you, do something for yourself not cause she/he wants you to do it. Dont try to act or be somebody that youre not, show who you really are and your true color because thats how you really know who is there for you and who is just faking to support you because they want to see you at your lowest.

One lesson I would like to teach elementary school students is about science because it is fun, it is the most easiest subject to teach, and it is the most used in daily life. Firstly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is fun to most adults and kids. First, science is fun because you get to do different types of experiments. For example, If you want to learn about kinetic and potential energy you can use science experiments that have kinetic and potential energy in them. Some experiments can have you involved in throwing a ball so you can illustrate kinetic and potential energy. Second, science is fun because everybody can enjoy it. For example, say one student does an experiment everyone in the class can experience it because they all witnessed it. Lastly, science is the most fun to make a lesson about because it involves you talking to other people and sharing your observations. For example, If you did a egg drop experiment, you will compare your results to different types of students in your school and hopefully learn from what you did wrong or the opposite. Therefore, science is fun because you get to deal with experiments. Secondly, one lesson I would like to teach is science because it is the most easiest to teach to many students and adults. First, science is the most easiest because it does not require you to memorize or remember something every single time. For example in other subjects unlike science you have to memorize the root words for English, or memorize the formulas for math, But here all you have to do is memorize the terminology and you should be good to go. Another reason why science is the easiest is because it is involves experiments which are not hard to understand all it requires you to do it pay attention. For example, If you pay attention to the experiment then you will know every bit of it, But in math you have to keep on practicing again and again until you get it. Third, science is the most easiest to many students because it involves drawing pictures which is the most easiest way to understand something other than memorizing. For example, say that the students dont get it by words so, what you can do is illustrate for them so they get what you are trying to say. This works best in science because because science is the subject that involves the most of drawing and experimenting. So at last, science is the best subject to teach about because it is the most easiest to understand. Thirdly, I would like to create a lesson about science because it is most used in daily life. Firstly, it is most used in daily life because everything can relate to science. For example, it can be related to light because light can cause radiation, it can be related to the air conditioning because it involves air traveling in currents. All of these thing are related to science and there is certainly more. Secondly, Science can help you understand more of your daily life by performing a lesson. For example, say that you dont know how to use a compass, science can tell you the answer to that because it relates to the magnetic field. Last, science is the most used in daily life for fixing things and being able to understand how things work. For example, science can tell us a lot of information, some examples can be how does a circuit work, how do fix a circuit, how does a light turn on so fast, or other possible things too. In addition, science should be the lesson because it is the most used in real life. In conclusion, one lesson I would like to teach in elementary school is science because it is the most fun and makes a lot of students smile when they do science, it is the most easiest to teach because it involves minimum talking but a lot of drawing, and lastly it is the most frequently used in real life. So therefore, I should get my science lesson ready for the elementary school students soon because they would have the most fun in this while learning. Would you teach science why or why not?

725,34,DE8EAEAC72D9,"Imagine of having your own business by the time you graduate from high school. I think its a good idea for students to commit or take specific courses at a young age for their future lifestyle because you will have more experiences also you can save a lot of money, you dont have to worry about for college. Althogh some people think its a bad idea for students to commit to a career because they just into high school, However they will have more experience by the time they graduate frome high school and live a better lifestyle because they already havea good career and have money and they might have graduate early and started their own family or family business. Some students like to be me a business man or women so the plan to take classes about thoses to topics so they can learn more and they can help the others with their busines. The first reason why its a good idea to commit to career in a young age is because you will gain more experience and gather information that can help you with your career and have a better lifestyle so you can have everything you need and dont need nobody to help and you can ask others for their advices on hows to gain more experience and some students can take online class. I understand having to plan your career little early in hard because you have to have good grades and enough credits graduate early. So if you want to have better lifestyle you have to put in te hard work and you cant stop unitl you reached your goal and your happy with it. also you apply for jobs to gain as many experience you wanna gain for explam you can work at the fast food resturants and at subway and the doctor offices or at walmart and forever twentyone. and having a business is hard because my dad has one and we barly get to see him because hes so busy and his bussines is not even to close to us is at TN and we get to see him only once a month or two. The second why having a career is so impartant because you can save alot of money like a lot. Because saving money is good because you can really rich and you have to be selfish in the begging if you want to became something great in life. although you have to spend a lot oof money at first because you having for your classes and programs that your in so you can study what you want and there are some school that will help their students to be succesful in life but have to put in the hard work first if you dont then thats a big problem because your not going to be rich your not going have a lot of money to have good lifestyle. So thats why students need to applying for jobs at age of sixteen and build baby steps to save money and doing good at school and having a better. There is alot of ways for stuents to gain money and save them for explam you make cupcakes at home and sale them at school or other events you can make alot of things a sale them and that how you save alot of money by working hard in school and having a job or making stuff. The last reason for having your career planed out in a young is to help you in the future weather you have to go college or not and if you have enough credits and your testing scores are good and you dont have a history of getting into a lot of fights and trouble. Then college is for you and you dont have to worry about having to pay for college becuase you can get a schoarship to the best schools ever and college is a important part of your career and life its where you can get more education and help you to become a better at what your doing in the future and if you want to something big you have to work hard like you cant stop because people that put the work they dont stop until they got they want in life and honstley some people have to work hard for everything they want but others dont because the were born with golden life. Although some its a good idea to have experience with other careers and with making stuff and having alot of money and not playing for college but first you have to put in the hard work in oreder to be commit to a career in a young age because its really hard when you wanna commit to something dont have the goods and good testing scores for in that means you have to do double the work that your already doing. some peple can do anything when they put their brain and mind to it and thats good because if i only foucus in school would have been a straight AB student but i didnt so its hard for me to do that now because there is no time left and what i am trying to say is that dont wait until the same minute to do something specially if you wanna have good career and want to commit to it.

726,3429,EB5924FBD25C,"Although some say schools shouldnt extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school, actually schools should extend the school day two hours because students get enough time to do their assignments and home works also teachers got enough time to check students work properly and students can add one more subject. Some people say that schools shouldnt extend the school day two hours because some students and teachers might have work after school. But if we see that in another way instead of working after school sixteen hours with in four days we can just work eight hours in our three days weekend. also it is wast energy for instance, there is one student who works after school for three days until 5:00 pm - 11:00 pm. He came at school by 3:30 pm and he works at seven eleven which is the hardest place to work. It takes 15 minute to go and he have to at 4:45 pm to reach his destination on time. And then lets see after work he gets home at 11:00pm then he sleeps at 12:00 am. How can he focus on hes classes? this person is losing 2 things; 1, losing energy 2, not focusing on his classes he might fail the classes that he is taking The student that wants to extend the school day will have enough time to do their assignments and home works, also teachers get more time to check the students work properly because they probably got 3 days off if is there any meeting or doing some things in school for example, if the government decide there is a meeting every Friday. However, it is better for teachers to do their work as an example they can check students work on one day of their breaks and they can relax, hangout, playing with kids etc. Students also can do what every they want if we see one example, one student can finish his assignments and other school stuffs in one whole day and the rest of the the weekend is his he gets enough time if he get enough time then he is free from school for two days if he continue work on it he got 2 days free every weeks. In addition those who needs long time to study this schedule can help the students that who wants more time work on it. Learning is gaining knowledge, so that in these schedule students can add one more subject. How ever, based on this idea two argument comes from the students who wants to add extra class and the students who wants to extend the normal class by adding one hour for each classes. Adding one hour for each classes is better to have the experience to sit for two hours and 30 minute in one class. And also its good to work long time on one subject, but as we see in high school student this idea is trash. It can work for only in college class based on that the college students said that ""one man trash is another mans treasure"". When I come with my idea students can add one more subject because it is Better to get credit on that class and students can choose 3 or more elective classes . For example one student wants to take 3 classes that he have to take and pass for graduate high school he wants to learn 2 classes that helps him in the future. In Virginia law you have to take English 12 and Maths classes. Also to graduate high school it require Personal and Financial Economics to take it. those 3 classes are History, Biology, and one elective class to get a full credit. If the school can only learn 7 subjects this student is going to add another 1 year to learn only one class. Finally Schools should extend the school day two hours because students get more time to do things that they have to do and it also useful for teachers they can get enough days off. Also teachers work harder than students, so that teachers work 4 days and 3 days off. And Students can add one class to get more credit.

727,3571,9C37912D9442,"I think that failure is the key to success in life, That means that without having any obstacles you are not going to succed. Churchchills is right that failure is the pursuit of success. You have to try to do what you want to do. If you have a dream to become someone you want to fight for it. Make good choices and try hard. Sometimes is hard to achieve your dreams, because maybe you are not capable to do things or you dont know how or where to start. You can ask for help to your parents, teacher, and people outside of school, so they can help you with something. People make mistakes, And they learn from it. You have to try over and over to do what makes you happy. You can fall down one or three times, but you have to get up many times you can. Make a plan, and write down the things that you want to do, and don t be shy to ask for help when you needed. Be a enthusiam person, If you fail to do something try to do it again. Nothing is easy in life, with effort everything is possible. If you are in school try to do your best at school and ask questions to your teachers. For example: I am a high school student. At first I was a very shy person, well Im still a shy person but not like I was before. I was shy to ask for help to my teachers and whenever I needed help I didnt know what to do because I was shy and quiet. At first I didt know how to ask for help, but then I realize that without asking for help to my teachers I was not going to succed, and I would never learn how to do things. I was also shy to asked my parents to help me with something, so everytime I needed something I used to go locked my self in my room and figuring thing out, But I also learn to ask them for help, even though they dont speak english, they still helped me with my school work. You have to do the same thing and ask for help to a trusted adult that can help you, so you can succed in your life, If you have bad friends stay away from them, because they are not good people and you are going to end up ruining your life. I believe that if you fail, try to do it again. Do what makes you happy and succed in your life.

I say that because, people everyday, all the time, imagine great things all the time but without any knowladge, how will they make that thought turn into reality without having any knowledge what so ever?? Knowledge is way more important that imagination because many inventors, scientist, constrution workers, normal people, use it in thier every-day lives!

But knowledge isnt just about reaching a goal or building something, its about having idea or knowing what your doing and whats going around you.

729,2304,E12401B92C3B,"Some people want to be the best example in life; however, not all of them can be. Even the most famous and intelligent people that we can know is not the best example to follow because if we go and investigate their life they also have done things wrong. Everyone makes mistakes and is alright in this world. I disagree with what Albert Schweitzer said. In fact my personal conduct is not the best way to act for other people to follow me because it is difficult being a good example and is better if we influence them differently. To begin it is difficult being a good example. Everybody does good things in their life; however, there are some days where we do not feel good and by accident or because we want to do it, so we do things not right. For example: I do not like when my aunts talk to their daughters about me. My aunts explain them that I am a good example in my family because I have two jobs and I go to school and in my free time I prefer to stay with them at home than going out with friends that they do not know. I know the things they say are correts but I told them do not use me as an explample because now I am like that, but if tomorrow I decide to quit school or I do other things is not going to be the best example they are waiting for. Some might say that it is easer having jobs and going to school and being a good example in your family because there are many people who does the same, but I know in reality is very difficult mostly if you are helping your family too. Next is better if we influence them differently. Not by being their examples but being as a guide to follow. For example: I have an aunt who had her first kid at her 14 years old. Now she is 30 years old and she does not have more babies just the firt one. She tells to my cousins and I that it was the worse experience that she has not for her child but for her husband. She remembers everything that she lived at that age and how she had to deal when she can not have her baby because she was young and her body was not completely develop. Later for her surprise she had to work and maintain her child and her husband because he did not work or do anything. Now she cries when she tell us her stories, but my aunt says that she wants the best for us and she does not want it to happen to us. My aunt says that she is not the best example in our family because she did not obbey my grandparents, but she has learned many good things in life base in her experiences. Some people may say that they are the best examples for their children even if they do things not right in the past, but I believe that we learn from those mistakes but still we are not the best example because we already did bad things. In conclusion being an example of our own behabior is not the best way to influence people! There are many different ways to influence others as you know it is difficult being a good example and is better to influence people diferently. There are many occacions where we recognize that we do great jobs in life, and people have to see us like good examples. However; people can see us like good examples but not to exaggerate because some people think that just because they do something good they are the best. And I know they can think that because every single minute in our life is count it and also challenged, and we do not want to waste our time.",8,7,6,6,6,6,3217,"conventions 6, grammar 6, phraseology 6, vocabulary 6, syntax 7, cohesion 8"
730,718,A570CD64F0F9,"A single persons actions can change how other people act. Albert Schweitzer, a philosopher said, ""Example is not the main thing in influencing others; it is the only thing"". I agree with his statement and believe it as true, as most people look up to and copy whoever is currently popular on social media. People also like to follow the example of what they are taught, by parents or teachers. In this essay, ill be talking about how setting an example for others is the best way to influence others into doing something. First of all, Watching someone do something that interests you could influence you into doing the same. For example: if you like food and you watch someone cook, it could possibly persuade you into making your own food. Most of the time, people would not do something without being influenced or persuaded by someone else. Take Juuling for example, most kids would never do such a thing unless being persuaded or peer pressured by their friends. Secondly, Teaching someone to do good by an example is also good, as it sets them down a good path, just as most parents do. A person cant do something they were never taught or ever learned, so they look to other people who can do things; and look up to them. Only by setting an example can others follow. Much like a pack of wolves, the leader sets an example and rest follow it. It could be argued that a speech or something of the sort could also influence people, such as Martin Luther King Jrs ""I Have A Dream"" speech. In the past that might have been the best way to influence people, but in modern day society a majority of people are influenced by action and examples. Otherwise, why would kids be doing these ""Challenges"" that you hear on the news every other day? In conclusion, Examples are the best and most effective way to influence others into doing things. By setting examples, people are influenced into doing all sorts of things. Whether they are good or bad is completely subjective and depends on what the person is influenced into doing.

Well how can you change someones day by just telling a wis thing, has anyone told you anything that change your life and why you should never give up.

Giving up is when you never got to hear a word about believing in yourself or you have never accepted a wis word from anyone. People can just say anything to bring you down but fighting through is the oppisite of giving up. My parents always told me to never give up because giving up means you want to shut anything in your brain and not do anything about it.

The second reason is meeting people in a good way and never in a negative way. meeting people in positive ways is very great thing to do meaning that if you treat someone like garbage theyll treat you the some or even doing something terrible that will ruin your life, and nobody like that at all, so thats why you should treat people positive to avoid the things that I mention or you just like treating people positive because thats your nature.

You can be very helpful by helping people out or doing chores. Doing something all the time can make you physically fit. You can be moving all the time and a lot it can be good exercise. I like working out or helping people out especially my family. Many people enjoy or like to be active and it makes them feel good including myself. I cannot stay inactive for a long period of time like many people in this world. In some peoples life activity plays a major role in there lifes. Like a personal trainer or a coach. Inactivity is sometimes bad especially if you do it for a long time. It can be frustrating to other people if everybody is working but you and they need your assistance. If Iam inactive for a long period of time i can get sick or really anybody if you have been laying around doing nothing for days. Your body needs movement or some type of exercise. Thats why its better to be active. Therefore, inactivity can sometimes be good or necessary. For example, if you are watching a movie at the movie theater. You cannot be jumping and running all over the place you are going to get kicked out. In some situations when something bad is happening out side your home is better to stay as far away as you can and donot intervene is better to stay idle.

734,471,6751442A85E4,"I remember when I got in trouble for making the wrong decision. In this essay, I will argue that making decisions on your own can lead to some problems and you need someones help. People should seek for guidance before making any decisions because it prevents them from getting into trouble, can help you make the right choice, and you can be more successful in life. Consulting with an expert can help prevent bad situations. Although, it might sound silly sharing your personal life. It can help you in many ways. For example, when youre angry and want to do something that will cost you your whole life. Thats the time to express your feeling to someone else. The best way staying out of trouble is having someone guide you because you dont want to end up one day behind bars. Making the right choices can lead to a healthier life. Meaning that, its most likely for you to have a positive mind. I remember when I decided to break my friends trophies. I was so mad that I wasnt thinking right. The next day I woke up and realized what I had done wasnt right. However, I decided to talk to my parents and they gave me some good advises regardless to what I had done. After that, I apologized to my friend and everything went back to normal. I felt relieved because I had so much pressure on me. Sometimes its better to make the right choices because it releases our stress. Having a successful life is what everyone wants. In order to be successful in life is to take advises from your parents. As a teenager, we might think we know everything but its the complete opposite. The key to success is always get advises from an expert or even your parents, which will make you a better person in life. Some say that, we as teenagers can make decisions on our own; but, they are wrong because not everyone can handle their own situations. Seeking for help from someone else is always a better option. In the future, I hope teenagers like me seek for help when making an important decision. ",8,9,8,8,8,9,1343,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 9, cohesion 8"
735,3432,5A977087E7E8,"Dear Principal; Changing the cafeteria lunch for a healthier lunch is a good idea. There is going to be new food, healthier food, and different types of food that others students never taste before. As a student I really like this idea because there is going to be a healthy food for all of us. New lunch menu, having a new lunch is going to make many students happy because there are students that are getting tired of having the same lunch almost everyday, but it also can effect others students because there are many students that enjoy eating the same lunch and they never get tired, In thus case is better is you as a principal talk to the cafeteria manager and ask her for a list of wich food is the students favorite and at the end ypu and your company can decided whether you change the menu or not, but as a students I think its also better if you just see wich food students like and take away the food that students eats the least and change that for the new food and live the food that students likes. Students might be happy, Because you are not taking the food that students likes and also bringing different menu that students will be happy to have. We are trying different menu and that is also making us be different from others schools and they would see our school as a example, and they are going to do the same and is quit better because is not only our students that are getting tired of the cafeteria menu, there are others students in different schools that are also going trough to this issue. Schools from different states might see us and take the same idea as you have principal, that is going to halp not just the students it also helping our parents to save money, Because students that dont like the menu no more are telling their parents to buy then food from outside, and somentimes does parents dont have the money to do so. It also can help students dont skip classes to go buy from from outside bucause they dont like the food no more, that can help the students, parents, and also the school from not having a bad reputation. Tasting different types of menu, trying new things like food is somenthing that students also loves I put my self for example. There are students that likes to try different food, the cafeteria have bad and healthy food but its not equal and for that we need a change, we need to have more healthier food, some studets are also alergit to food that is in the cafeteria and thats why they dont eat and they get sick because they eat only at home and most of the time we in school and we dont have the opportunity to go out and buy food. Bringing healthy and different lunch menu is good, becase we are able to taste differnt food and healthier, students wont need to get out of class just to go and buy food from outside, its dangerous that just for students that skip it also for our parents, Because the school call and let our parents thet we skip and they get worry for you fo not letting then know where you are or what are you doing. My conclution is that students are going to be happy if you just ask the cafeteria manager fo a list of wich food students loves the most, and one of wich one they like the least. Thats is going to help all students to be conform with the new changes that you wants to do, students are going to have their favorite food and others students wont need to skip class to go out and buy food, parents wont be worry no more and students are not going to take any risk of getting sick because they dont eat. Healthy food it can help us with many things like, your body, less fat, and more proteins are going to be in our body. Parents wont have to buy food for the kids no more and they are going to save money, Changing the school menu is a great idea that most of the students are going to understand, and for the one that dont they are going t get used to it.

But if you take that away from them there going to have nothing and they wont be looking forward to going to school. And they may feel that they are not good in any thing but sports; and it motivates you to be better in school it teaches you how to cooperate with other student , how to be a good leader/captain, and many more.

737,10,96CCD6C82658,"Author Ralph Waldo Emerson once wrote ""Unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will never grow."" I agree with this statement, a couple of reasons why i agree with this statement. The journy, learning new things, and the final results of what you have mastered. First reason will be the journy. The journy will be the important part becuase its going to be the part where you will be going to grow more. The journy will teach you mastering new things therefore this brings me to my second reason the learning new things. Mastering new things will be so much help in the future. You will be able to master new things along the way on your journy to growing up more. You can never stop growing omn something you want to master. My last and final reason will be the ending. The ending is the part where you have already mastered all the new things you wanted to master on your journy. You will be able to use it any where you go, any where you are at, and with anybody. As the ending result i totally agree with the Author Ralph Waldo Emerson about ""unless you try to do something beyond what you have already mastered, you will not grow."" You have to still keep on mastering new things in order for you to grow more. Those are my three reasons why i agree with Ralph Waldo Emersons statement.

738,2109,B1AFACE6704E,"I agree with Michelangelos statement as I have found through experience that it benefits me more to set high expectations and not reach my goal, rather than settling on a low goal and achieving it. When setting high goals, I find that I learn more and progress my abilties further than I do with a lower goal. This is because setting high goals requires confidence, challenges, and pride. Firstly, hard work is required to achieve high goals, and requires confidence. Confidence involves having trust and believing that you are capable of accomplishing something. I have found that when I set high goals, I feel more confident in my abilities. With lower goals however, my confidence is lower as I settle for the easier path and do not trust myself to do better. With a higher aim, my confidence motivates me to not give up. I tend to try harder, and always believe in myself. For example, at school, I had to choose whether I wanted to try out for the varsity tennis team or remain in the club team. The varsity team was a higher reach, and required confidence in my abilities for me to try out. The club team was a lower reach, as I knew that I could simply continue with it. I decided to try out for the varsity team, and was confident in my abilities. I practiced hard and did not give up. Despite not making it onto the team, I found that I actually greatly improved my abilities through the confidence I had gained, and tried harder than I had ever before. I managed to progress my skills, and was able to play more confidently on the club team and excel. Therefore, setting high aims requires confidence, which is a very beneficial characteristic to have in life. Secondly, setting a high goal indicates a challenge. It will be more challenging to attempt to aim high rather than aiming low, yet this will also prove more benefits. With a challenge, I tend to be more motivated as I want to prove my capabilites. I try harder, and in return get further. Even if I fall short of my high aim, I tend to get further than I would have if I had settled with a lower aim. With lower goals, there is no challenge, and so once the aim is achieved any effort stops. Learning is limited to that low expectation, and will not be able to go beyond. For example, in my high school career, I have always struggled with picking between two types of courses: honors or academic. Honors is the more challenging course, which requires more work and effort and would pose as more of a challenge. Academic however, requires the bare minimum and is easy to succeed in. In the honors course, I would be setting my aim high yet might not get the grade I want; yet, in the academic course, my aim would be low and I would most likely get the grade I want. After hard consideration, I decided to opt for the honors course. This course may be a challenge, yet would allow me to learn more. I enjoyed the challenge, and found that it motivated me to try harder to try and accomplish my goal. Even if I fell short of my ideal grade, I was proud to have tried my best and felt that I learnt so much more. The course benefited me more than the academic course would have, despite not receiving the grade I hoped for. Therefore, challenging oneself with a high aim allows for more flourishing and encourages more learning. Overall, setting a high aim will pose more benefits. Thirdly, pride accompanies setting high goals. When setting low aims, I feel that it is easy to achieve the goal. However, with high aims, it is more challenging to achieve the goal, and so I feel proud of myself for attempting it. Pride is a very important characteristic, as it increases self esteem. With a higher self-esteem, I tend to try harder and feel more powerful with my abilities. I am more likely to learn and improve upon my abilities, which overall allows me to succeed. For example, in high school I had the opportunity to write a poem and submit it into a writing competition. This was a high aim, as the goal was to win. I felt very proud of myself for taking the time to write and challenge myself with this competition, and ended up writing my favorite piece yet. I submitted my writing, and did not win. However, I felt very proud of myself for having tried so hard and was able to learn and flourish in my writing abilities. Now, I am more likely to sign up for competitions, even if I do not win, simply because I enjoy the challenge and feel that I am able to learn. I feel proud of myself for taking on these challenges. Therefore, setting high goals emmits pride, which can prove very beneficial in life. In conclusion, I agree with Michelangelos statement. Setting high aims and falling short can bring so many more positive effects than setting low aims and accomplishing them. This is because setting high aims requires confidence, challenges, and pride. These characteristics are very important in succeeding, and can encourage learning and progression in abilities. Through setting low goals, learning becomes stagnant. In order to flourish and continue learning, setting high goals is crucial, even when not achieving the goal.

Have I ever give up in something that I thought never could be success on it? Do I agree with churchills statement about the important role that failure play in the pursuit of success? Which is my opinion? First of all, to me success is to be good at what you do, cooking, driving, boxing, flying, playing sport or teaching it dosnt matter what it is, if you are good on it you are going to be succesful. And yes. I believe that to be success really consists on going from failure to failure withour give up. because sometime we need to know how it feel to fail in order to feel what is success mean. you know. To me those people that didnt work hard, dont know how failure feel like are the one that faster go down, cuz they dont care about it, unti they got there. My thinking about success, is the thats the best moment of a person who fighting and fighting for what he or she wants withour giving up unti his/her last breath. You know. One year ago when I went to my country, I hear a lot of peaple saying this guy die unhappy cuz he didnt enjoined at all what he work so hard to accomplish. and then the guy who was the death guy bestfriend and partner said. he didnt die unhappy cuz he die doing what he wanted to do all his life. Later I began to think about that ask to myself is really important fight and fight to success in something and I know that everyone there did the same because they all stay quiet for a few secands. And after that. success to me is be good at what you want, fight for it, and be happy. Since I remenver my family telling me, that the most important things on life are those that you make by you on. You know. My family are very poor people. So when I was like 11 yuears old I deciIde to get a job, so I could buy things like pencil, pen thigs like that and went to my neighbor have a factory of cofe and he pay me like 1 dollar but in dominican money every day. In a few day a lot of pencil, and a began to sell then. I never had to be worrie for those things any more or money for project. I guess that time feel really seccesful I was doing something the really worked. I have a friend who is now a professional boisboll player, he fail a lot of time the test to be a professional beisboll player because he didnt had what was needed to pass it, and he didnt give up until pass it. He was so happy that they. i have had give up in a lot of things. looking back now that I think about if I will put more enthusiasm on it, maybe I would success.

The frist reason why I said students will not get on because they will be like i get on next time and keep on saying in till they think it not useful at all then they will not get on and just go outside and play with there friends or sometimes there Mom or Dad have to keep telling to get on and they migth not listen to them or just get on there ps4 or phone . Number two reason is that they can fall asleep while on it and the teacher cant do nothing about it but if we was at class a real class they can tell us to get up and make sure we doing what we suppost to do by going to class that can make the teacher work way more easy for them. Last reason but not least is that they will not do there work they will get on but how can you know they the one doing it they can get someone eles that they know or just pay them to do it for them teen are bad but smart.

Many high schools have partnerships with companies that help student to know about different jobs and companies. Some companies have internships and shadowing opportunities that helps student to find out their interest. Schools should have partnership with compamies because it helps students to get ideas about Work environment, work skills, and jods requirement The partnerships with companies and schools allow student to know waht kind of skills need for different jobs. Then students can find out their strong points and select the jobs according to their skills. Studens are good on math work on computer programing,web designing, and computer engineering. Students without internships activities take time to select the work that they want to grow up. They suffer to select their jobs. On the other hand, students with internships activities already had began to grow their occupation. They are heading toward in college as well as their jobs. Work environment is very importent. Different people like different work environment. We should select the job that attends our demands. Some people like to work individually while other like to work with group. Internships and shadowing allow student to know about different work environments before select the jobs. Some people may say people adjust themselves with the work environment but the question is how long time it will take a person to adjust with the environment?. Also, in a recent report says that we accomplish more when we work in a favorable environment. All jobs have some requirments. All the jobs do not have same requirements. Some jobs need experience while other jobs do not need experience. Internships and shadowing opportunities help students to get these information from the employers. With these information student get a chance to prepair themselve. They meet the requirement before their high school graduation. People may say that job requirements can be find out in online, but often we get the wrong information from online. By internships and shadowing we are getting right information directly from the employer without any difficulty. In conclusion, students are getting a lot of information from the companies that have partnerships with the schools. It is a great way for the students to build up their future.

These specific people say they usually go outside to relieve stress, and get their mind off things. This is one key factor to why you see elderly people outside. But our main focus was on modern day children and why they love going outside. Children always want to have fun, but usually with their friends. Additional to this fact, they start to create games and activities with their friends giving them a chance in looking forward to going outside everyday.

Though this game was only played by girls, through recent years we start to notice not only girls but boys and adults playing this game. Though hopscotch isnt a really competitive game and can be played alone, its better when its played with other people. Another game played much more often is freeze tag, or tag, which consists of two teams and two catchers and played by both girls and boys. This game involves running which can improve both your physical well-being and cardio-respiratory endurance, This game isnt usually played by adults as seen in frequent surveys, and tend to be a child only game.

Taking classes in home or schools have some similar benefits but not overall benefits. Although, I think taking classes from home have benefits and not because some students have health problems and it is not a benefit because students cant learn good like in school. At first, taking classes from home can be a benefit because it helps students who have health problems like students that have problems to walk or different disease. Also, for students that their parents dont let them to go for problems. For example, if students who have arthritis, they cant go to schools because they cant walk.

Also, it can be a benefit for students that had problems in schools like fight with others students. Those students can take classes in home with help of someone or by online. In this way, they can get help and learn things without go school. Moreover, I think it is not a benefit for students who dont want to go schools because if they dont like the schools, they will be doing whatever they want because there wont be a teacher who tell them what to do; and they cant learn good because there are no one who explain them the class. There are many students who dont speak English and they dont want to go school but they want to learn. For example, I cant speak English so good because I am not a native American, so if I dont want to go school and want to learn the language, taking classes from home would be hard for me because in home I will learn slower than schools because in schools are many people speaking English and in home I just hear one time at day. It better if I hear English the most of the time because I can learn so fast because I will make friends to help me.

748,2323,475AAF4D130E,"Most successful people keep study new carrers or leanirng new tasks to do in order to became even wealthier and to not get bored of doing the same job daily. Ralph Emerson states that, you will never grow if you do not try something new that you already know. Meaning that if people do not expand their knowledge after of what they already know they will never accomplish more to became more successful in life. However, if you are willing to expand you horizons and break out the comfort zone, you will grow and achieve higher goals. Trying something new of what you already mastered help people to grow because it lead people will live real experiences and it provide more opportunities. and it break the comfort zone. To star with, the more people learn, the more opportunities they have. Opportunities are provide for people that are open to learn new things and grow in what they do. For instance, I have been working in a part-time in a salad place for two years. The first year I learned all the work stations which I was really good at it. After a year, I realized that it was the time to expand my knowledge and also to ask for a raise. I became a valid trainer in all the stores stations. Now I teach new workers and assist them how to do their task in the correct way and they are paying me better. This shows that if I would not be open to learn how to be a trainer at the store, I would not be paying as well as today. Being capable to try something new offer better opportunities in order to grow rather than getting stuck in the same place without trying to achieve higher goals. Moreover, the desire to try different things make people to live many wonderful experiences. If people never expand their horizons , they will never experiences the adventures life has to offer. For instance, Last summer I went to a campus in a university to get more information about careers that I was interested in. I meet wonderful students from other schools and learned computer science. The teachers provided me the information and requirements to get into the University and the different classes that I have to take in order to get a degree in computer sciences. Also, we practiced several methods to create graphs and draw in the computers. Since, I visited that place I got more convince to study computer science in the future and it is a experience that I will never forget because I realized that I have the skills to study that career as my major. If I would not go , I will never notice that I could study computer science in the out coming. Learning new things lead to live and learn experiences that help people to grow in their future. As can be seen, it is better to try something new because people can explore experiences that will never forget and and they will learn new things to became even more successful in their lives. People have the right to never stop learning and get new skills that will prepared them for whatever they want to accomplish and change about their routine. If the whole world have the willing to keep learning despite they are mastered in something already, they will be more professionals and a wealthier society.",8,8,8,8,8,9,937,"conventions 9, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 8, syntax 8, cohesion 8"

Community park provide a lot of opportunities such as spending time with friends and family, sports and exercising, and doing school assignments. These are my three reasons what you can do respectfully and peaceful at your nearest community park. I hope you find these helpful for you in the future. Spending time with friends and family at a community park is a good way of making bonds stronger with each other. Parks have a lot of activities to do in a park for example there is a lot of outside games you can play. My opinion on how parks can make your bond stronger is that you can talk to them while you walk, jog and other activities. For example Generic_Name and Generic_Name went to the park to go play checkers. They talk about grades and other subjects for one hour. Their bonds got stronger they hang out every day. Community parks have a lots space playing. Sports burns calories and it is very fun to play sports. You can make new friends with sports might even get ask to play on their team. For example Generic_Name brings her new ball to her community park nearest to her. Generic_Name brings her ball to the court kids dashing as fast they can to her. A crowd of kid show up to her begging if they can play they make teams. Generic_Name makes a lot of friend and plays soccer with them everyday.

753,1476,EF5922BDE9E5,"Benefits of working in a group is much easier than working all by yourself. For example, working with a group can help the students communicate with their classmates. They can also get a lot of work done by working in groups. Working with groups is such a good idea because the classmates can communicate with each other , take the stress away from working alone. For example I have a lot of teachers who like to assign assignments independently and group work. Its a hassle for me to work on my own because I have a busy schedule after school. At times I dont even get to turn in my assignment when its due. When my teacher assigns group its way easier for me because all of my classmates will get to get a job to do with the assignment and we can work on it at school and be finished before the due date. Its also nice to go out of your confront zone and make new friends while working on assignments and an easy A. Being in groups knowledge you to understand better by your classmate. Example one day in history we had a project to do as a group and I was completely lost on the civil war. I had to ask my classmates questions if they can help me so I can understand better and get to do the work. Sometimes teachers doesnt know how to be specific so it gets hard to understand. Seeking help from a classmate thats in your group is a good thing to do and you learn more and becomes more understandable. Not a lot of students like to work in groups because their scared they have to do the work , however; if you communicate with your classmate and assign a job it will go easy on them and get the work done quicker and easier. In conclusion , working with groups its more beneficial instead of cramping in the work and not get it done.

757,195,4FFF2AD2EAE8,"Have you ever had a subject that you liked or you know it so well? If I had a chance to talk to a elementary school, I will teach them about English. The reason why I would chose English because you will need to know it throughout you whole life, you need to know how to use correct grammar, and its easy to learn. English is fun and easy to use whenever you need it. First, If you live in America you will need to know the basic language and thats English, you will use English throughout your whole life. In school you will start learning English in preschool and it goes throughout your whole life. When people come from other places that are not in America some people have trouble speaking English because they have not learned about it. So if you have not learned it when you were young it going to really hard for you to understand. When you get older and you have a job you will need to talk to people and you will need to know how to write and type. Even though if you dont have a job you will still need to learn how to speak English. When you need to do important work for the government or tax work, you need to sign and write you information. In real life if theres an emergencies and you well need to talk to someone you will need to learn how to speak English. Finally, English will be with you fro your whole life and it helpful if you know how to speak it. Second, one of the biggest thing you will need to know in life is how to write in English. In life there are going to so much times where you need to write you name and the date. When you get older you will need to learn how to write your address and make sure that grammar is correct like commas, period, and spelling arrows. Also, will need it when your in school you well need it everyday by writing your name to writing a whole essay and it needs to not have any grammar problems. You will also need when you have a job and if you become a teacher you will need to learn the more detail information. When there is important information that you will need to sign your address, you will need to add commas and that involves you learning English. Finally, this is the reason why its important to learn English because you will need to know the grammar to it. Third, English is the easiest to learn because if you get how to write you will know it for your whole life. If you learn how to use commas and other things then you will learn it for your whole life. There is three things that you will need for English and it how to speak, or write, and grammar. You will need those things for essay projects and more. It is easy to learn because you are using it for your whole life over and over and when you do things over and over and it gets stuck in your head. English is also fun because when you get something it makes you feel good. You might not know but you are using everyday even if there is now school you are texting or writing a letter. This is another reasons why I would like yo teach a class about English because it easy and at the same time its fun. Last, these are all the reasons what I will teach a elementary school about English because your whole life depends on you speaking English, you will need to learn how to write in English, and it easy an easy subject to learn. First, speaking English is not really hard and it will become really useful. Learning how to speak English your life will move slowly because you dont have to worry about someone else talking for you your whole life. Second, you would even know that your using English but you are because you are always typing or writing and you will need to learn English to be able to do that. Last, the easiest subject to learn is English because when you get it you will always use it.

758,3839,CCEFC4392340,"Most students enjoy summer vacation, but some educators think that summer break is too long and students do not retain information as easily as they would in the fall. Because of this a lot of educators think we should have year- round school years. This would be shorter breaks in the summer (3-4 weeks) and longer more spread-out breaks throughout the year. I disagree with this statement and believe that summer break should stay the way it is. The first reason I disagree with this statement is that it would ruin certain summer activities or even business plans. Think about all the activities in the summer that kids usually take part in, this could be sports, some sort of trip, etc. All of these activities students would preferably do during summer break. They have this preference because they see the summer as a perfect time to do all these activities without having to balance their education as well. They can put most of their time on this activity. The same preference applies to things like summer jobs or internships. During the summer they can learn important values like how to save and earn money. Or if a certain student has a chosen career path they can explore this career path by going in a internship for that spesicifc job. For all of these activities students at the very least would be discouraged to participate in if there was a year-round school year. The second and probably most important reason is pertaining to the students mental health. An article, by Complex News writing about kids mental health stated, that over 40% of kids by the end of their freshmen year in high school are depressed or overall feel exhausted and depleted mentally. The article continues to say that this number from the time of their freshmen year only increases after each school year. Students use the summer break as a way for their brain to refresh from the long almost ten month school year. Students need this time to relax their brain and get ready for the next year of education. As a student, I can say that during school my brain goes into this state where I am mostly just focused on school work. And I can admit that my brain at multiple points during the year is worn down and damaged by always be in this state. My brain does not get a chance to heal from this until the summer, when school is over. So if we were to hypothetically have a year-round school year, this would mean that the brain would also be in this damaged state year round. If this were the case than the brain of the student would eventually just break and shut down. No student should have to experience that because of a year- round school year. Although the strongest reason for this year-round school year is that students cannot properly retain enough information for the next school year, I think I have a much stronger counter claim and solution to this problem. A very simple way to take care of the problem of retaining information, is to make mandatory (but simple) assignments from the previous year for the student to complete so that they dont forget this information. This way students can have their long summer break to refresh their brain and do their activities, without them having to forget any information. You get the best of both worlds with no need for a year-round school year. In conclusion I think my assertions for the summer break to stay the way it is is much stronger than year-round school year argument. Having a year-round school year would be unnecessarily tedious and dangerous as it would negatively affect summer activities and mental health. As someone said once upon a time ""Dont fix it if it aint broke.""",10,9,10,8,8,8,2806,"conventions 8, grammar 8, phraseology 8, vocabulary 10, syntax 9, cohesion 10"

But do we really accomplish more if we are always doing something to help shape our future or can inactivity also serve a purpose as well? In my opinion, much can be accomplish if we are always doing something to perserve our future and make it safe and way better then how our generation is now. We can make it better for all the generations that comes after us by keep on doing something to shape and preserve our society. Thomas Jefferson wrote that determine never to be idle which means that always be determined to do something to help shape our society into something more and better and to never lack your worth. If people back then wouldve never done anything like build roads or invent automobiles or anything, we wouldve never had what we have now. Inactivity can also serve a pupose to our society and how our future is going to look like. It can make a huge impact on how we live now and how our future is going to look like and how is it going to be like if people wouldve been inactive. Everything that we built and invented wouldnt be here in this generation or the next one. We probably wouldve been living like how the great depression was back then but a lot worse because there wouldnt be any people working or there wouldnt be any cars or even houses and buildings because people were inactive this could lead to all of us being poor. We wouldve been out there living on the streets with no houses all because people were being inactive back then and not build anything that can help shape our future. We all have a certain unique skill set we can use to help our world and make our society a better place then what it is now. We can keep making things and accomplish our goals that can be done by not quiting and always keep doing something to make a change because who knows what we can accomplish and how we can make an impact on how our next generation is going to be like if we always keep doing something. A lot of things can be done when we do something instead of being inactive and doing nothing to help with our society because when we do nothing it has a much bigger effect then actually doing something, we could all be out on the streets probably with no job or even a house to live in because it was never invented because of the many people that were inactive in the past. We already accomplished so much because of the people in the past did something and they always kept doing something to actually make a huge difference to what the future will look like. Therefore we accomplish a lot more when we keep doing what we do now a lot can be done, if we keep making an impact our future is going to keep chaging into something more better then how we live now, having always something to do serves a huge purpose.",6,6,7,8,7,5,1655,"conventions 5, grammar 7, phraseology 8, vocabulary 7, syntax 6, cohesion 6"

But you have to work hard a school dont get introuble at school and not have a bad record so you can accomplish to graduated from Hight school and Collage .In my opinion is worth it be in school for seven hours to pay atention in school cause it will help a lot in your future .The second thing I would like to accomplish is to learn French because thats one of the lenguage Im intersted on because I like French culture and I feel that French is an easy lenguage to learn because its similar to Spanish and I would like to have the opportunity to know three lenguages (Spanish,Inglesh and, French) and if you know more than one lenguage you can help another people at school and you can also get paid more on your Job .The third thing the I really want to accomplish is to help my parents when Im older I really want to do this have been with me all the time ,they are been such a good perents I know the they probably wont need my help but I really want to accomplish this goal for many other reasons one of them is because this is coming out of my heart.

766,992,B403A4E28BCE,"Why do we need to seek guidance from experts and authorities about lifes important matters? Why cant we make our own decisions? Its because the adults knows whats best for their kids and they been through everything that we are experiencing right now as a teenagers. Or is it because they would like to keep us safe and make good life choices in the future? But, I think we should make our own decisions because we know whats best for us, we can learn from our mistake, and we want to be more independent. First, when we do something bad and get in trouble for it, we know not to do it next time. For example, I had a friend and she decided to go to a party and I told her not to go because its always a fight. Well she went and ended up getting hit in her face. I tried and warned her but she make her own decisions and I wanted her to make her own decisions so I let her go. Now she doesnt go to parties anymore. Then, we know whats best for us. If we know something were doing is wrong but everybody is doing it too, then we will do it just so they wouldnt make fun of us or we want to be ""cool"". But, I only do it one time, while other people keep on doing it. For example, when we choose the wrong groups of friends to hang out with. Knowing they are bad but sometimes they bring out the other side of you that nobody have seen or they get you in trouble just so you can fit into the group. Then you wonder why you even became friends with them in the first place. Last, we dont listen our parents or any adults telling us whats right and whats wrong. we would want to figure things out by ourselves and be more independent. We know when they telling us that we shouldnt do certain stuff because they did it before when they were younger. But we know what were doing ( well at least some of us know). Sometime we dont tell our parents whats going on at school or on social media but somehow they find out whats going on with us. We sometimes try to hide the problem and solve it our selves but it doesnt go well. In conclusion, teenagers today will want to do everything and not listening to the adults. When we get older and start to understand why we did all those crazy and nonsense stuff in high school or middle school, like fighting (knowing its not going to solve the problem), making fun of other people (knowing thats not how we would like to be treated), and smoking (knowing its bad for our lungs). We just wanted to be like everybody else"". But, at the end of the day we learn from our mistake and become a better person in life.

The can even get lunch and hang out if they have a break time. Some people like to talk a lot and geting to know the people they work with. If you are working with a group you can get more frends they can get more friends by talking to them. Second by doing things for them like helping them with their homework. You also ge more friends by making them laugh and giving them things. I know it is hard getting to know people more getting to know people can be hard because some people are shy like me. It might take them a while to met new poeple. Some people just do not like talking because they can be really shy and get nervous their hands can get really sweaty. I chose working wih a group because the benefis can help out a lot of people like me that are really shy and onse I get to know them I wont get shy as much like I use to be. Finally people are fun to hang out with like my English teacher Generic_Name she is a really good teacher and makes everyone smile and laugh.

All the achievement that I been doing are made by my self because, I effort without the help of people that are around me. In this world that I am know, I can not trust anybody because instead of wishing me the good things they wish me the worst. People sometimes are bad because they are telling me to do bad things, school does not help me to be someone in life, and they do not want me to be successful, but without them I would be someone with a better future in the world. To make an accomplishment, I do not need all people that are around me. They are not going to help me to be successful in this world. An example is I had a friend named Generic_Name she was a nice person with me, but them she started to change. Generic_Name told me to me to skip school with her because, school is not going to help me to be someone in life. She had a misconduct with her parents. She did not stop to do bad things, so I stop talking to her because, My parents did like her anymore. I wanted to be friend with her but,what she was doing it was not good, so I need to worried about me. To be someone in this world I have to work hard to do what I want without others around me because, when I need something or I get in a trouble they are not going to be there with me. An example is yesterday I took a test with others students in math class, and one of them told me to help him. I did not wanted to help him because, the teacher can get mad at me. After we finished the test he got closed to me, and he was complaining. I told the student that he should studied because, people are not going to be their when he needs to take a test. Another reason to be successful in this world is that I would never give up, and will always do what even if the people said that I am not going to made it. A example is I am graduating this years and my cousin told me that I am not going to graduate because I am not very smart. I do not care what she said but, the only thing that I know is that I am trying my best to graduate this year. Sometimes I want to cry because she is always saying bad things to me. In this world I dont need nobody to be someone else even my family. After all this, I think that I do not need people around me because they are not gonna be there to support me. Being with people that is around me is not good because, some of them would tell me to do bad things instead of doing good things. In this world that I am living right know people can killed me and cause me so much damage. It is better to just you in this world because you do not have to worried about someone else.

771,201,FEDCB06D743F,"Dear Generic_Name, It has come to my attention that schools have partnerships with companies that allow students to explore certain occupations trough interships and shadowing opportunities, to discover whether they are interested in pursuing that type of job. However Im in favor of the new opportunities that the schools are offering to young teenagers. Allowing students to explore certain ocupations would motivate students to decide what type of job they want to dedicate their life on. Every student dreams to have a perfect job, were they can have a good enviorenment and do what they love to do, But for many other reasons; students do not have the same opportunities as others. with the new chances that companies are offering to students, everyone has the choice to be what they want and be succesful in life. Every student goes trough a hard process were they have to decide, what they want to become in life. as a result not everyone gets the job they wanted to, causing that this person feels miserable working in a place were they dont feel comfortable. many juniors and seniors are feeling the pressure deciding what type of job they want; However companies allowing students to discover what their passion is and what type of job they want to get,would increase the percentage of students achieving their goals and get the job they wanted to. Not every student has the chance to get the job they want to. either way because they dont have the sources to reach their goals or they cant because they are not well stablish financially. for example, my dream is to become a doctor but no one of my family have gone to collage, they dont have any expierence nor the sources to help achive my dream. I believe im not the only one that is going trough this, schools partenerships with companies benefits everyone in many differente ways, causing that every student has the chance to succed in life. Lastly, allowing students to have the will to explore new opportunities benefit those who are still deciding what they want to become in life, and those who dont have any chance on achieving their goals. its very important that every teenager prepares to the real world, without having any doubts or risking themselves to be unsuccesful. companies allowing students to choose what they want to be in life can be one of the many reasons that our future can be secure.

Some people believe that technology doesnt cause negative effects on peoples lives, but this is not true because technology can cause problems on peoples lives.

One of the problem is that today technology had a big impact on people specially in adults, kids, and adolescents. The majority of people are using technology some of them knows what it can cause if they are using this all the time. For example, some kids start using technology when they just have 4 or 5 years old, and it can cause positive effects and also can cause negative effects because they start learning, but at the same time they are creating a big addiction to cell phones. The parents have to control this and dont give to their kids cell phones because they just are kids and dont need to use technology too much. Kids can use technology to study or have fun, but they need limitation of technology . Second reason, why does technology cause negative effects on peoples lives is because adolescents are using technology to play online. This is causing a big problem to them because they are getting addiction to this. Some adolescents just prefer to stay at home playing and they dont want to go out with their parents. The Washington post had a article about the addiction that technology is causing on peoples lives. This article says that people who are playing online are having problems with banks. For example, Some of them have to pay to play online. They cant stop playing because they have a addiction. They start using credits card of their parents and they create debt with banks.
